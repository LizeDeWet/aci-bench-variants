I'd like to tell DAX a little bit about you, okay?\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Martha is a 50-year-old female with a past medical history significant for congestive heart failure, depression and hypertension who presents for her annual exam. So, Martha, it's been a year since I've seen you. How are you doing?\n[patient]  I'm doing well. I've been traveling a lot recently since things have have gotten a bit lighter and I got my my vaccine so I feel safer about traveling. I've been doing a lot of hiking. Went to Washington last weekend to hike in northern cascades like around a Mt. Baker area.\n[doctor]  Nice. That's great. I'm glad to hear that you're staying active, you know. I... I just love this weather. I'm so happy the summer is over. I'm definitely more of a fall person.\n[patient]  Yes, fall foliage is the best.\n[doctor]  Yeah. Um, so tell me, how are you doing with the congestive heart failure? How are you doing watching your diet? I know we've talked about watching a low sodium diet. Are you doing okay with that?\n[patient]  I've been doing well with that. I resisted as much as I could from the tater tots. You know, the soft pretzels, the salty foods that I love to eat. And I've been doing a really good job.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right. Well, I'm glad to hear that. And you're taking your medication?\n[patient]  Yes.\n[doctor]  Okay, good. And any symptoms like chest pains, shortness of breath, any swelling in your legs?\n[patient]  No, not that I'm not interested.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right. And then in terms of your depression, I know that we tried to stay off of medication in the past because you're on medications for your other problems. How are you doing? And I know that you enrolled into therapy. Is that helping? Or...\n[patient]  Yeah, it's been helping a lot. I've been going every week for the past year since my last annual exam. And that's been really helpful for me.\n[doctor]  Okay, so no, no issues, no feelings of wanting to harm yourself or hurt others.\n[patient]  No, nothing like that.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right. And then in terms of your high blood pressure, I know that you and I have kind of battled in the past with you remembering to take some of your blood pressure medications. How are you doing with that?\n[patient]  I'm still forgetting to take my blood pressure medication. And I've noticed when work gets more stressful, my blood pressure goes up.\n[doctor]  Okay, and, and so how has work going for you?\n[patient]  It's been okay. It's been a lot of long hours late nights. A lot of, you know, fiscal year end data that I've been having to pull. So a lot of responsibility, which is good, but with the responsibility comes the stress.\n[doctor]  Yeah, okay, all right. I understand. U-O-R-I-C. Well, I know that you did a review of system sheet when you checked in with the nurse. I know that you were endorsing some nasal congestion from some of the fall pollen and allergies. Any other symptoms? Naja or vomiting abdominal pain? Anything like that?\n[patient]  No, nothing like that.\n[doctor]  No, okay, all right. Well, I'm gonna go ahead and do a quick physical exam, okay?\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Hey, dragon, show me the blood pressure. So, yeah, looking at your blood pressure today here in the office, it is a little elevated. You know, it could just, you could just be nervous. Uh, let's look at some of the past readings. Hey, dragon, show me the blood pressure readings. Hey, dragon, show me the blood pressure readings. Here we go. Uh, so they're running on the higher side. Um, why, you know, I do think that, you know, I'd like to see you take your medication a little bit more so that we can get that under control a little bit better, okay?\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  So I'm just going to check out your heart and your lungs and you know let you know what I find okay.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Okay, so on your physical examination, you know, everything looks good. On your heart exam, I do appreciate a three out of six systolic ejection murmur, which I've heard in the past, okay? And on your lower extremities, I do appreciate one plus pitting a Dima, so you do have a little bit of fluid in your legs, okay?\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Let's go ahead, I want to look at some of your results, okay? Hey, Dragon, show me the echocardiogram. So, this is the result of the echocardiogram that we did last year. It's showed that you have that low-ish pumping function of your heart at about 45%. And it also SH shows some mitral regurgitation. That's that heart murmur that I heard, okay?\n[doctor]  Um, hey, Dragon, show me the lipid panel. So looking at your lipid panel from last year, you know, everything your cholesterol was like a tiny bit high, but it wasn't too, too bad. So I know you're trying to watch your diet. So we'll repeat another one this year, okay?\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  So I want to just go over a little bit about my assessment and my plan for you, okay? So for your first problem, your congestive heart failure, I want to continue you on your current medications. But I do want to increase your lysinopryl to 40 milligrams a day, just because your blood pressure is high. And you know, you are retaining a little bit of fluid. I also want to start you on some LASIX, you know, 20 milligrams a day. And have you continued to watch your diet, okay?\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  I also want to repeat another echocardiogram, okay?\n[patient]  All right.\n[doctor]  Hey, Dragon, Order an Echo Cardiogram. From a depression standpoint, it sounds like you're doing really well with that. So I'm really happy for you. I'm glad to see that you're in therapy and you're doing really well. I don't feel the need to start you on any medications this year unless you feel differently.\n[patient]  No, I feel the same way.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right. And then for your last problem, your hypertension, you know, again, I, I, I, I think it's out of control. But we'll see. I think, you know, I'd like to see you take the lysinopryl as directed. Okay. I want you to record your blood pressures within the patient, you know, take your blood pressure every day. Record them to me for like about a week. So I have to see if we have to add another agent. Okay. Because we need to get that under better control for your heart failure to be more successful. Okay.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Do you have any questions? And I forgot. For your annual exam, you do for a mammogram, so we have to schedule for that as well, okay?\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Okay. Do you have any questions?\n[patient]  Can I take all my pills at the same time?\n[doctor]  Yeah.\n[patient]  Because I've been trying to take them at different times of the day, because I didn't know if it was bad to take them all at once, or I should separate them. I don't know.\n[doctor]  Yeah, you can certainly take them, you know, all at the same time as long as, yeah, they're all one scale. You can take them all at the same time. Just said an alarm.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  some time during the day to take them, okay?\n[patient]  That might help me remember better.\n[doctor]  All right, that sounds good. All right, well, it's good to see you.\n[patient]  Good seeing you too.\n[doctor]  Hey, Dragon, finalize the note.",

Some a little concerned.\n[doctor]  Yeah, and so, wh. What side of your back is it on?\n[patient]  Honestly, it shifts. It started from the right side and it kind of moved over and now I feel it in the left side of my back.\n[doctor]  Okay, and how many days has this been going on for?\n[patient]  the last four days.\n[doctor]  Okay, and is the pain coming and going?\n[patient]  Um, at first it was coming and going and then for about the last 48 hours, it's been a constant and it's it's been pretty bad.\n[doctor]  Okay. And what have you taken for the pain?\n[patient]  Tylenol, but it really doesn't seem to help.\n[doctor]  Yeah, okay. And do you have any blood in your urine?\n[patient]  Um, I think I do.

Um, and have you had any other symptoms like nausea and vomiting?\n[patient]  If I'm doing something I'm like exerting myself, like climbing the three flights of stairs to my apartment or running to catch the bus, I feel a little dizzy and a little lightheaded and I still feel a little bit more pain in my abdomen.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right. So let's talk a little bit about your migraines. How are you doing with those? I know we started you on the Amatrex a couple months ago.\n[patient]  I've been pretty diligent about taking the meds. I want to make sure I stand top of that, so I've been pretty good with that.\n[doctor]  Okay, so no issues with the migraine?\n[patient]  None whatsoever.\n[doctor]  Okay, and how about your acid reflux? How are you doing with, I know you were making some diet changes.\n[patient]  Yeah, I've been pretty good with the diet, but with the pain I have been having, it has been easier to call and have something delivered. So I've been ordering a lot of takeout and fast food that can be delivered to my door. So I don't have to go out and up and down the steps to get it myself.

Okay, well, let's go ahead and I know the nurse did a review of systems, you know, with you and I know that you're endorsing some back pain and a little bit of dizziness and some blood in your urine. Any other symptoms? You know, muscle aches, chest pain, body aches, anything like that?\n[patient]  I have some body aches because I think I'm favoring my back when I'm walking because of the pain, like I kind of feel in my muscles, but not out of the ordinary and not surprised because I remember that from two years ago.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right. Well, let's go ahead and look at your vital signs today. Hey, dragon, show me the blood pressure. Yeah, so your blood pressure is a little high today. That's probably because you're in some pain. But let me just take a listen to your heart and lungs and I'll let you know what I find, okay?\n[patient]  Sure.\n[doctor]  Okay, so on on physical exam, you do have some CDA tenderness on the right hand side, meaning that you're tender when I pound on that.\n[patient]  MM\n[doctor]  And your abdomen also feels a little tender. You have some tenderness of the palpation of the right lower quadrant, but other than that, your heart sounds nice and clear, and your lungs are clear as well. So let's go ahead and take a look at some of your results. Okay?\n[patient]  Sure.\n[doctor]  Hey, Dragon, show me the creatinine. So we drew a creatinine when you came in here because I was concerned about the kidney stones. It is up slightly, which might suggest that you have a little bit of obstruction there of one.\n[patient]  MM\n[doctor]  of the stones. Okay? Hey, dragon. Show me the abdominal X-rays. Okay, and there might be a question of a stone they're lower down. But we'll wait for the official read there. So the abdominal X-rays show a possible kidney stone, okay?\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  So let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you. So for your first problem, your back pain, I think you're having a recurrence of your kidney stones. So I want to go ahead and order a CT scan without contrast of your abdomen and pelvis. Okay?\n[patient]  MM\n[doctor]  And I'm also going to order you some ultra-50 milligrams as needed every six hours for pain. Does that sound okay?\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Hey, dragon, order Altram 50 milligrams every six hours as needed for pain. And I want you to push fluids and strain your urine. I know that you're familiar with that.\n[patient]  Yes, I am.\n[doctor]  For your next problem, for your migraines, let's continue you on the imitrex. And for your final problem, for your reflux, we have you on the prognix 40 milligrams a day. Do you need a refill of that?\n[patient]  Actually, I didn't need a refill.\n[doctor]  Okay, hey dragon, order a refill of protein x 40 milligrams daily. Okay, so the nurse will be in soon and she'll help you get the cat skin scheduled. And I'll be in touch with you in and a day or so.\n[patient]  Perfect.\n[doctor]  If your symptoms worsen, just give me a call, okay?\n[patient]  You got it.\n[doctor]  Take care.\n[patient]  Thank you.\n[doctor]  Hey, hey, dragon, finalize the note.",

Um, and what have you taken for the pain?\n[patient]  I took some Tylenol. I took some ibuprofen.\n[doctor]  mmm\n[patient]  I tried ice. I tried heat, but nothing really worked.\n[doctor]  Okay, and H, how are you feeling now? Are you still in the same amount of pain?\n[patient]  uh by Monday morning it loosened up a little bit but it's still pretty sore\n[doctor]  Okay. Any other symptoms like leg weakness? Pain in one leg, numbing or tingling.\n[patient]  I actually felt, um, I had to struggle in my right foot, like drop foot. I had some struggling with my right leg. I felt that for a while, and it got a little bit better this morning, but not much.\n[doctor]  Okay, alright, so are you? How are you doing walking around?\n[patient]  uh... uh... i'm i'm not going anywhere fast or doing anything strenuous but i can walk around a little bit\n[doctor]  Oh\n[patient]  Not too fast.\n[doctor]  All right, okay.

And any problems laying flat while you go to bed?\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  Okay. Uh, and lastly, what about your diabetes? How are you doing with that diet? I remember you have somewhat of a sweet tooth.\n[patient]  Yeah.\n[doctor]  Jelly beans?\n[patient]  I love jelly beans, yeah, yeah. That's been a struggle, but I'm getting through it.\n[doctor]  Okay, alright, and you're watching your blood sugars at home.\n[patient]  MM, I monitor it regularly. Not always, I can forget, but I'm pretty good about my measuring it.\n[doctor]  Okay. And you are still on your Metformin?\n[patient]  Yes.\n[doctor]  Okay. Alright. Alright. Now I know the nurse did a review of Symptoms Sheet when you checked in.\n[patient]  MM\n[doctor]  I know that you are endorsing the back pain.\n[patient]  MM\n[doctor]  And maybe a little weakness in your right leg. Any other symptoms? I know we went through a lot.\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  Okay, so I want to go ahead and move on to a physical exam, okay?\n[patient]  MM\n[doctor]  Hey, Dragon, show me the vital signs. So here in the office, you know, your vital signs look great.

Okay. All right. So, on your physical exam, everything seems fine.\n[patient]  Good.\n[doctor]  On your heart exam, I do appreciate a two out of six systolic ejection murmur, which we've heard in the past.\n[patient]  MM\n[doctor]  So that's stable.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  On your back exam, you do have some pain to palpation of the Lumber 5 or Lumber spine.\n[patient]  MM\n[doctor]  at the level of L5.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  You have, you know, decreased range of motion with flexion and extension, and you have a positive straight leg raise for your strength. You do have a 4 out of 5 on your right and 5 out of 5 on your left.\n[doctor]  So what does that mean? What does all that mean? So that basically means that, you know, I think that you probably, you know, have injured your back with a muscle strain, but we're going to look at some of your results, okay?\n[patient]  Okay, sure.\n[doctor]  Hey, Dragon, show me the back X-ray. So, in reviewing the results of your back X-ray, this is a normal X-ray of your Lumbar spine. There's good bony alignment. I don't see any abnormality there, which is not surprising based on the history, okay?\n[doctor]  Hey, Dragon, show me the diabetic labs. And this is just, I just wanted to check your last, uh, diabetic labs that we did on you. Uh, it looks like your hemoglobin A1C has been a little high at 8. I'd like to see that a little bit lower around 7, okay?\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  So let's just talk a little bit about my assessment and my plan for you. So for your first problem, I think you have an acute lumbar strain.\n[patient]  MM\n[doctor]  And I want to go ahead and prescribe meloxicam 15 milligrams once a day. And I'd like to refer you to physical therapy to kind of strengthen that area. Now, if you're still having symptoms, I want to go ahead and order an MRI.\n[patient]  MM\n[doctor]  Just to make sure that you don't have any disc herniation or anything like that, okay?\n[patient]  That's fine.\n[doctor]  How does that sound?\n[patient]  No problem.\n[doctor]  Hey, Dragon, order Meloxicam 15 milligrams once a day. For your next problem, your Type 2 diabetes, I would like to increase your metformin to 1000 milligrams twice daily.\n[patient]  MM\n[doctor]  And I want to go ahead and order another hemoglobin a 1C in a couple weeks, or I'm sorry a couple months.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  All right. Hey, dragon, order a hemoglobin A1c and for your congestive heart failure, I think you're doing really well with it. You know, I want to just continue you on your current medications, your lysinopryl and your lasex. Now, do you need a refill?\n[patient]  Actually\n[doctor]  of the licent April?\n[patient]  Actually I do.\n[doctor]  Okay. Hey, Dragon, order a refill of Lyciniprol 20 milligrams once a day. And so, the nurse will come in. She's going to help you get checked out. I want to see you again in a couple weeks, okay?\n[patient]  That's fine.\n[doctor]  Any questions?\n[patient]  Not at this point.\n[doctor]  Okay. Hey, Dragon, finalize the note.",

Your heart, I hear a three out of six systolic ejection murmur. That's stable. Your lungs otherwise sound clear. Your abdomen is soft and you do have some pain to palpation of your lumbar spine. And you've had decreased flexion of your back. Your lower extremity strength is good and there's no edema. So let's go ahead and look at some of your results. Hey, dragon, show me the ECG.

I'd like to tell DAX a little bit about you, okay?\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  So, Stephanie is a 49-year-old female with a past medical history significant for congestive heart failure. Kidney stones and prior colonoscopy who presents today for an abnormal lab finding. So, Stephanie, I called you in today because your hemoglobin is low. Um, how have you been feeling?\n[patient]  Over the past couple of months, I've been really tired and dizzy. Lately, I've been really just worn out, even just walking a mile or going to work, doing things that I've done in the past every day that have been relatively okay, and I haven't gotten tired. And now, I've been getting tired.\n[doctor]  Okay, yeah. I, you know, the nurse told me that you had called with these complaints. And I know that we have ordered some labs on you before the visit. And it did. It's see, you know, your hemoglobin is your red blood cell count. And now, and that came back as a little low on the results, okay? So have you noticed any blood in your stools?\n[patient]  uh... no i haven't i did about three years ago and i did a colonoscopy for that but nothing since then\n[doctor]  Okay, yeah. I remember that, okay. And how about, you know, do your stools look dark or tary or black or anything like that?\n[patient]  No, nothing like that.\n[doctor]  Okay, and have you been having any heavy menstrual bleeding or anything like that?\n[patient]  No, not that I'm not interested.\n[doctor]  Okay, alright. And any have you passed out at all or anything like that? Any weight loss?\n[patient]  No, no weight loss or passing out. I've felt a bit dizzy, but it hasn't L. Led to me passing out at all.\n[doctor]  Okay, so you endorse some dizziness. You endorse some fatigue. Have you, but you haven't had any weight loss, loss of appetite, anything like that?\n[patient]  No, nothing like that.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right. So, you know, let's talk a little bit about that colonoscopy. I know you had a colonoscopy about three years ago, and that showed that you had some mild diverticulosis. No issues since then?\n[patient]  Nope, no issues since then.\n[doctor]  Okay, alright. And then I know that, you know, you have this slightly reduced heart function, you know, your congestive heart failure. How have you been doing watching your salt intake? I know that that's kind of been a struggle for you.\n[patient]  It's been more of a struggle recently. I've been traveling a lot. I went up to Vermont to go explore the mountains and along the way I stopped at McDonald's and got two cheeseburgs. So I could be doing better. I've noticed some swelling in my legs. But nothing too extreme that where I thought I should call.\n[doctor]  Okay, alright. And any shortness of breath or problems lying flat at night? Anything like that?\n[patient]  No, nothing like that.\n[doctor]  Okay, alright. And then in terms of the kidney stones, I know that you had those a couple years ago as well. Any recent flare ups? Have you had any back pain, flank pain, anything like that?\n[patient]  No, nothing like that.\n[doctor]  Okay. Any blood in your urine that you've seen?\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right. Um, okay. Well, I know that the nurse did a review of system sheet when you came in. And we've just talked a lot about your, your S, your symptoms, you know, your dizziness, your fatigue, and that type of thing. Anything else that I might have missed fever chills, any nasal congestion, sore throat cough.\n[patient]  I've had a little bit of nasal congestion just because with the seasons changing I get seasonal allergies but everything else has been okay.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right. Well, I'm gonna go ahead and do a quick physical exam, okay?\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Hey, dragon, show me the vital signs. So, here in the office today, your vital signs look great. Your blood pressure is fine. Your heart rates are right where it should be, which is good, okay? I'm just gonna do a quick exam, and I'll let you know what, what I find, okay?\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  All right. So your physical, physical examination looks fine. So on your heart exam, I do hear a three out of six histolic ejection murmur, which we've heard in the past, okay? And on your lower extremities, I do notice some trace to one plus pitting a dima in your ankles, which is probably from the salt intake, okay?\n[patient]  MM\n[doctor]  So we'll talk about that. I want to just look at some of your results, okay?\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Hey, Dragon, show me the echocardiogram. So, I just want to go over the results of your last echocardiogram that was about six months ago. That shows that you do have the low pumping function of of your heart at about 45%, which is not terrible. And it does show that you have some moderate mitral regurgitation. So, that's that slight heart murmur I heard in your exam, okay? Hey, Dragon, show me the hemoglobin. And here, this is the hemoglobin that I was referring to. It's low at 8.2, okay? So, we'll have to talk a little bit about that, all right?\n[doctor]  So let me go over a little bit about my assessment and my plan for you, okay? So for you first problem, this new anemia, I want to go ahead and send off some more labs and anemia profile just to see exactly what type of anemia we're dealing with. I also want to go and refer you back to the gastroenterologist for another evaluation, okay? Hey, dragon, order referral to gastroenterology. So they're going to do probably do an endoscopy and another colonoscopy on you. But again, I want to send off those labs just to make sure that it's not something else, okay?\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  For your next problem, your congestive heart failure, I do think you're attaining a little bit of fluid. So I'm going to go ahead and start you on some LASIX 40 milligrams once a day. I want you to continue you on your Toprol 50 milligrams daily and as well as your Lysinoprol 10 milligrams a day. I really want you to watch your salt intake, okay? Get a scale. Wear yourself every day. And call me if your weight starts to go up, okay?\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  because I might need to give you more diuretic.\n[patient]  All right.\n[doctor]  And for your last problem, your kidney stones, I think everything seems to be fine right at this time. Again, continue to watch your diet and stay hydrated. And I know that might be a little difficult with a diuretic, but do your best. And give me a call if you have any question, okay?\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  All right. Any questions right now?\n[patient]  not that I can think of.\n[doctor]  Okay, great.

Hey, Dragon, show me the rapid strep. And you also have a positive for strep. So I think we have some reasons as to why your blood sugar is so high.

From a rapid strep standpoint, we're going to go ahead and treat you with penicillin or I'm sorry, a moxicillin, with 500 milligrams three times a day. Uh, make sure you take it all. Even if you start feeling better, okay?\n[patient]  for sure.\n[doctor]  Hey, dragon, order a moxasillin, 500 milligrams, three tens a day for 10 days. Um, okay.

So Roger, I heard you went to the ur for some chest discomfort.\n[patient]  Yeah, we were doing a bunch of yard work and it was really hot over the weekend and I was short of breath and I felt a little chest pain for probably about an hour or so. So, I got a little nervous about that.\n[doctor]  Okay, and how do you ever had that before?\n[patient]  No, I never have actually.\n[doctor]  Okay. And...\n[patient]  Who's Mike is on? I'm in.\n[doctor]  Okay, and how are you feeling since then?\n[patient]  Um, after, uh, we were done, I felt fine ever since, but I thought it was worth looking into.\n[doctor]  Okay. And no other symptoms since then?\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  Okay, and any family history of any heart disease?\n[patient]  uh... no actually not on my uh... on my immediate family but i have on my cousin side of the family\n[doctor]  Okay, alright, alright. And, um, you know, I know that you had had the knee surgery.\n[patient]  MM\n[doctor]  A couple months ago, you've been feeling well since then?\n[patient]  Yeah, no problem in rehab and recovery.\n[doctor]  Okay, and no chest pain while you were, you know, doing exercises in point for your knee?\n[patient]  No, that's why last week's episode was so surprising.\n[doctor]  Okay, alright. And in terms of your high blood pressure, do you know when you had the chest pain if your blood pressure was very high? Did they say anything in the emergency room?\n[patient]  Um, there were a little concern about it, but uh, they kept me there for a few hours and it seemed to regulate after effect. So it didn't seem to be a problem when I went home.\n[doctor]  Okay, and I see here that it was about 180 over 95 when you went into the emergency room. Has it been running that high?\n[patient]  Uh, usually no. That's why it was so surprising.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right, all right. Well, let's go ahead and we'll do a quick physical exam. So looking at you, you know, I'm feeling your neck. I do feel a little enlarged thyroid here that's not tender. You have a carotid brood on the right hand side, and your lungs are clear. Your heart is in a regular rate and rhythm, but I do hear a three out of six systolic ejection murmur. Your abdomen is nice and soft. There is the healed scar on your right knee from your prior knee surgery, and there's no lower extremity edema.\n[doctor]  So let's look at some of your results, okay?\n[patient]  MM\n[doctor]  Hey, Dragon, show me the blood pressure. Yeah. And here, your blood pressure is still high, so we'll have to talk about that. Um, hey, Dragon, show me the EKG. So, hear you. That's good. You're your EKG.\n[patient]  MM\n[doctor]  Here is normal, so that's that's very encouraging. Um, I know that they had the echocardiogram. So let's look at that. Hey, dragon, show me the echocardiogram. Okay. So looking at this, you know, you do have a little bit of a low pumping function of your heart, which you, you know, can happen and we'll have to look into that, okay?\n[patient]  MM\n[doctor]  So, you know, my impression is that you have this episode of chest pain, that could be related to severe hypertension or it could be related to some heart disease. So what I'd like to go ahead and do is, number one, we'll put you on, we'll change your blood pressure regimen. We'll put you on Carvedi-Lal, 25 milligrams twice a day. That helps with coronary disease as well as your pumping function of your heart. I want to go ahead and order a cardiac catheterization on you and make sure that we don't have any blockages in your heart arteries responsible for the chest pain.\n[doctor]  for the high blood pressure, we're going to add the carvedile oil and I want you to continue your lysinoprol 10 milligrams a day and I want to see how your blood pressure does on that regimen, okay?\n[patient]  Okay, sounds good.\n[doctor]  All right, so the nurse will be in soon and I will schedule that cat for you, okay?\n[patient]  You got it.\n[doctor]  Hey, Dragon, finalize the note.",

So, Joseph, how have you been doing?\n[patient]  Yeah, I've been kind of managing through my depression and my asthma has been acting out because we had a really bad pollen season and I am at least keeping my diabetes under control. But just it's just persistent issues all around.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right. Well, let's start with your diabetes. So your diet's been good?\n[patient]  um... for the most part but we have been traveling all over to different sports tournaments for the kids so was a weekend of uh... eating on the go crummy junk food pizza and didn't really stick to the diet so that was a bit of an adjustment\n[doctor]  Okay, all right. Um, but ha ha, have you? Let's just talk about your review of systems. Have you had any dizziness, lightheadedness, fever, chills?\n[patient]  Running up and down the stairs, it was pretty warm, so I'd feel a little bit light-headed, and I didn't get a little dizzy, but I thought it was just the heat and the fatigue.\n[doctor]  Okay. Any chest pain, shortness of breath, or belly pain.\n[patient]  Shortness of breath. No belly pain though.\n[doctor]  Okay, alright. And how about any joint pain or muscle aches?\n[patient]  Uh, my knees hurt a little bit from running up and down and maybe picking up the boxes but nothing out of the ordinary.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right. And in terms of your asthma, you just said that you were short of breath running up and down the stairs. So, do, how often have you been using your inhaler over the past year?\n[patient]  Only when it seems to go over about 85 degrees out. That's when I really feel it. So that's when I've been using it. If it's a nice cool, dry day, I really don't use the inhaler.\n[doctor]  Okay. And um...\n[doctor]  And in terms of your activities of daily living, are you able to exercise or anything like?\n[patient]  Yes, I do exercise in the morning. I ride our bike for probably about 45 minutes or so.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right. And then your depression, you said, it's, how's that going? I know we have you on the on the Prozac 20 milligrams a day. Are you taking that? Are you having a lot of side effects from that?\n[patient]  I was taking it regularly, but I've kind of weaned myself off of it. I thought I felt a little bit better, but I think I kind of go through battles with depression every so often.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right. Are you interested in resuming the medication or would you like to try a different one?\n[patient]  I may be adjusting what I'm currently taking, maybe L less of a dose so I don't feel the side effects as much, but I'm willing to try something different.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right. Okay, well, let's go ahead and we'll do a quick physical exam. So looking at you, you're in, in no apparent distress. I'm feeling your neck. There's no cervical lymphedenopathy. Your thyroid seems not enlarged. And listening to your lungs, you do have some bilateral expiratory wheezing that's very faint and your heart is a regular rate and rhythm. Your abdomen is soft and your lower extremities have no edema. So let's go ahead and look at some of your results. Hey, Dragon, show me the PFTs.\n[doctor]  Okay, so you're your PFTs that those are your breathing studies and those look quite good. So I know that you're weezing right now, but you know, I think that we can add add a regimen to that to help to help you with your exacerbations during the summer months, okay?\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  And then let's look at your, hey, dragon, show me the hemoglobin A1c. Okay, so your A1c, you're right, you know, over the past couple of months is, you know, your blood sugars probably been running a little high. So, you know, I know that you're going to get back on your diet regimen, but for right now, let's go ahead and we'll increase your metformin, okay?\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  And then hey dragon show me the chest x-ray. Okay, good and your chest x-ray looks fine so we know that there's no pneumonia there.\n[patient]  MM\n[doctor]  And it's just as all just from your asthma. So, you know, my impression of you at this time, you know, from a diabetes standpoint, let's increase them at 4,000 to 1,000 milligrams twice a day. And we will get a repeat hemoglobin A1C in three months. And I want you to continue to monitor your blood sugars at home.\n[doctor]  From an asthma standpoint, let's continue you on the albuterol. Two puffs, every four to six hours is needed, and we'll add Symbicort. Two puffs twice a day during the summer to kind of help prevent those exacerbations. And then from a depression standpoint, we'll go ahead and start you on a different medication, Zooloft, 25 milligrams once a day, and see how you tolerate that. Does that sound okay?\n[patient]  Perfect.\n[doctor]  All right, so the nurse will be in soon and she'll get you situated with all of that, okay?\n[patient]  Great!\n[doctor]  It was good to see you.\n[patient]  Same here.\n[doctor]  Hey Dragon, finalize the note.",

Um lungs are nice and clear. Your heart's at a regular rate and rhythm. You do have some trace pitting a Dima to your lower extremities.

I've been very diligent with it. And I'm in touch with a doctor and so far, so good other than this episode on Saturday.\n[doctor]  Okay, and you're watching your diet, you're avoiding salt. Have you had anything salty?\n[patient]  I cheat every now and then. You know, I try and stay away from a junk food and the salty foods. But for the most part, I've been doing a good job of that.\n[doctor]  Okay, alright. Um, and I know that they removed a cataract from your eye.\n[patient]  MM\n[doctor]  A couple of like a couple months ago. That's been fine.\n[patient]  That was three months ago, Thursday, and everything's been fine ever since.\n[doctor]  Okay, so no vision problems.\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  Okay, and you had a skin cancer removed about five months ago as well. You've had a lot going on.\n[patient]  Yeah, it's been a really busy year. And again, so far, so good that healed up nicely. No problems ever since.\n[doctor]  Okay, alright. So why don't we go ahead and we'll do a quick physical?\n[patient]  MM\n[doctor]  exam. Hey dragon show me the blood pressure. So here your blood pressure is a little high.\n[patient]  MM\n[doctor]  So, you know, I did see a report in the emergency room that your blood pressure was high there as well.\n[patient]  MM\n[doctor]  So we'll have to just kind of talk about that. Uh, but let's go ahead and we'll examine you.\n[patient]  Sure.\n[doctor]  Okay?\n[patient]  MM\n[doctor]  Okay, so you know, looking at you, your neck is very supple. I don't appreciate any fibular venous distension. Your heart is a regular rate and rhythm, no murmur. Your lungs have some fine crackles in them, bilaterally. And you have trace lower extremity edema in both legs. So what that means essentially is that you may have some extra fluid on board from eating salty foods.\n[patient]  MM\n[doctor]  along with this history of your congestive heart failure. But let's go ahead and look at some of your results. Hey, Dragon, show me the ECG. So this is a stable ECG for you. This basically shows that you have some left ventricular hypertrophy, which caused your congestive heart failure. Let's go ahead and review your echocardiogram. Hey, Dragon, show me the echocardiogram. So in reviewing the results of your echocardiogram, it shows that your pumping function of your heart is a little low, but it's stable. And I think that we know this, and we have you on the appropriate.\n[patient]  MM\n[doctor]  medication therapy. And then I just want to be reminded about the results of your skin biopsy. Hey, Dragon, show me the skin biopsy results. Okay. And in reviewing the pathology report for your skin cancer.\n[patient]  MM\n[doctor]  You know, it looks like they got all of that and everything's fine.\n[patient]  Yep.\n[doctor]  So, you know, my impression of you at this time for the shortness of breath that you had in the emergency department, I think it was an exacerbation of your heart failure. And you probably had some, what we call, dietary and discretion, you ate some salty food which made you retain some fluid.\n[patient]  MM\n[doctor]  So for that, I'm going to prescribe you an extra dose of LASIX 80 milligrams once a day. And we're going to put you on some Carvedi Law 25 milligrams twice a day. Okay?\n[patient]  Okay, perfect.\n[doctor]  And I think from a cataract surgery standpoint and your skin cancer removal, everything seems to be fine and you're doing well, so I don't think we need to adjust any of those medications.\n[patient]  Good to hear.\n[doctor]  Okay?

He states that he thought he was having a heart attack at that time. His wife took him to the emergency room and at that time, he states that he had been feeling very lightheaded and dizzy. He notes that on Sunday he felt fine.\n\nThe patient reports that he has been very diligent with his medications for his congestive heart failure. He notes that he has been avoiding salt for the most part but there has been some dietary indiscretion more recently.\n\nHe is status post cataract extraction approximately 3 months ago, and notes that everything has been fine since then.

So I'm just going to tell DAX a little bit about you.\n[patient]  MM\n[doctor]  So Rachel is a 48-year-old female here for shortness of breath. She has a history of depression, smoking, and chronic back pain. So tell me about this shortness of breath.\n[patient]  Okay, so there are times when I'm either doing very, very mild exercises or just walking. Even if I'm just walking up, you know, my driveway, I find myself palpitating a lot. And there's a little bit of shortness of breath.\n[doctor]  About the technology to reduce data can ensure R&P viewers can improve information on privacy control.\n[patient]  I don't know if it's got to do with the back pain, you know, whether that gets triggered as well at the same time.\n[doctor]  Right.\n[patient]  But definitely I feel it happens more often lately.\n[doctor]  Okay, and anything else changed recently? Like, have you changed lifestyle? Like, you're exercising more than you used to having any allergies, anything like that?\n[patient]  probably exercising more to get rid of the COVID-15.\n[doctor]  The COVID-15. Yeah. Now, last time I saw you, you were smoking two packs a day. How much are you smoking now?\n[patient]  It's gone down quite a bit because we said we have to make some changes as you get older.\n[doctor]  Yeah.\n[patient]  So I would say it's probably maybe a couple, probably a coup, I don't know. Probably once a day or something.\n[doctor]  Just a couple cigarettes a day.\n[patient]  Probably one today, yeah.\n[doctor]  We're getting close.\n[patient]  Yeah.\n[doctor]  That's awesome.\n[patient]  MM\n[doctor]  That's great news. And then how's your depression doing?\n[patient]  I have my moments.\n[doctor]  Yeah.\n[patient]  There's some days when I feel, you know, I wake up and everything was great.\n[doctor]  uh you\n[patient]  And then there are times I don't know whether it's got to do with the weather or what else kind of triggers it.\n[doctor]  Yeah.\n[patient]  There are some days when I feel extremely low.\n[doctor]  Okay. And you had been taking the effects or for your depression. Are you still taking that?\n[patient]  Yes, I am.\n[doctor]  Okay great. And then on the chronic back pain we've been giving you the gabapentin neuron for that. Is that helping control the pain?\n[patient]  I think it is.\n[doctor]  Yeah.\n[patient]  It is, it's definitely, um, I feel better.\n[doctor]  Ag !\n[patient]  But it does come every now and then.\n[doctor]  Right. What do you do when it's really bad?\n[patient]  I try to just get as much rest as I can.\n[doctor]  Okay, and you had talked about doing yoga. Are you doing yoga anymore?\n[patient]  I wish I said yes, but I haven't really made a habit.\n[doctor]  Okay, okay. Well, you know, said you said you were coming in with shortness of breath, so we sent you to get some pulmonary function tests.\n[patient]  MM\n[doctor]  So let's just look at those. Hey, Dragon, show me the pulmonary function tests. Okay, so it looks like it's interesting. It says that you might be having a little bit of asthma or a COPD. And if you are, we'll talk about that.\n[patient]  MM\n[doctor]  Let's look at our X-ray. Hey, Dragon, show me the most recent X-ray. Okay, I said it wrong. Hey, Dragon, show me the most recent chest X-ray. Okay, this is interesting. Your Cunninger diaphragm is a little bit flatter and we'll see that in some COPD, which happens with smokers often. So let's just do a quick physical exam. I know my nurse did the review of systems with you. Is there anything else bothering you that we need to talk about today?\n[patient]  No other issues.\n[doctor]  Okay, great. Let's do the exam. Alright, so your physical exam looks pretty normal other than you've got kind of these mild weasers in all your lung fields. And so I think you do have COPD from your pulmonary function tests, your x-ray, and that. So I'm going to diagnose you with COPD. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. It means you're not able to exhale appropriately.\n[patient]  MM\n[doctor]  So we're going to put you on a medicine called Combe Vent. Okay, you're going to do two puffs twice a day. It's going to help open up your lungs. It's an inhaler.\n[patient]  MM\n[doctor]  I'm also going to prescribe albuterol, which you use when you get really short of breath. It's like a rescue thing.\n[patient]  MM\n[doctor]  And then I'm going to prescribe some steroids to help also some prednisone. So let me just order those.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Hey, dragon order comb event. Two puffs twice a day. Order. I'll be you to all. Two puffs as needed and order a prednisone, a taper pack. Okay, so and then it sounds like your depression stable. So we're not going to change anything. You're going to keep taking the effects or de yoga for depression and your back pain. So for your back pain, stay on the nirontan and we just won't do anything different. Any questions for me.\n[patient]  No, I think this is good. Thank you.\n[doctor]  Perfect.

Okay. So, you know, the last time we spoke, you know, you were trying to think of some new strategies to manage your depression. You didn't want to go on medication because you're already on a bunch of meds.\n[patient]  Absolutely.\n[doctor]  So, how are you doing with that?\n[patient]  I'm doing well. I see a counselor once a week. And I've been out swimming at the pool a lot this summer and fall. So things have been well going well with my depression.\n[doctor]  Okay, so you don't want to, you don't feel the need to start any medications at this time.\n[patient]  No, no, no. But I know I can call you if I do.\n[doctor]  Yeah, absolutely.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Yeah, all right. And then in terms of your high blood pressure, how are you doing with that? I know we were kind of struggling with it law six months ago. How are you doing?\n[patient]  I still have my good days and my bad days. I do take my medicine daily, but you know that burger and wine every once in a while sneaks in there, and that's salt B. We know what that does.\n[doctor]  Yeah, so I love burgers and wine too.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  So I get it. Um, okay. So and you're taking the norbask?\n[patient]  Norvask, yep.\n[doctor]  Okay, um, and you're checking your blood pressures at home. It sounds like\n[patient]  I do. Well, I go to CVS Pharmacy. They have a machine that I can sit down at quickly and get my blood pressure taken. And I go there about once a week.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right. And then I know that you had that rotator cuff repaired about eight months ago. How are you doing?\n[patient]  It's doing well. I'm been stretching with a yoga ball.\n[doctor]  Uh..\n[patient]  and uh, I'm getting stronger each time. And I can continue that once a week also.\n[doctor]  Okay, are you still seeing the physical therapist in the center or are you just doing exercises at home?\n[patient]  I'm just, I progress to exercises at home.\n[doctor]  Okay. Alright. Great. Alright. Well, I know you did a review of System Sheet when you checked in.\n[patient]  MM\n[doctor]  And you know, it seems like you're doing well. Any symptoms at all? Any nasal congestion or chest pain, shortness of breath, anything?\n[patient]  No, none of those.

Maybe that has to do with some of the salt intake you're eating.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  All right, well, I want to go ahead and do a quick physical exam, okay?\n[patient]  MM\n[doctor]  Hey, Dragon, show me the blood pressure. Yes, so your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 156 over 94.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  You know, you could be a little happy to see me. I don't know.\n[doctor]  But let's look at some of the readings. Hey, Dragon, show me the blood pressure readings. Yes, so they've been a running a little high over the past couple months.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  So we'll have to just kind of talk about that, okay?\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  I'm going to go ahead and listen to your heart and lungs and I'll let you know what I find, okay?\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Okay, alright. So on physical exam, you know, everything looks good. On your heart exam, I do appreciate a slight three out of six systolic ejection murmur, but we've heard that in the past.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  So that seems stable to me. Um, on your long exam, everything sounds nice and clear, and on your lower extremity exam, I do appreciate, you know, 1 to 2 plus putting a Dima in your legs, okay? So we'll have to just talk a little bit about your diet and decreasing the salt intake, okay?\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  So, let me just look at some of your results, okay? Hey, Dragon, show me the labs. So, looking here at your lab results, everything looks really good. You know, your creatinine, that's your kidney function, that looks stable. Everything looks good from that standpoint. Hey, Dragon, show me the EKG. And looking here at your EKG, everything, you know, looks fine. There's no evidence of any coronary artery disease. It's a nice, normal EKG, which is good.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Okay?\n[patient]  Good.\n[doctor]  So, let me just talk a little bit about my assessment and my plan for you. Okay? So, from a depression standpoint, it's, you know, your first problem. I think that that sounds like you're doing really well managing it. You know, you have good strategies. It sounds like you have a good support system. And I agree. I don't think you need to start on any medication at this time, but you said before, you know, you can call me, okay?\n[patient]  Yes.\n[doctor]  For your second problem, your hypertension, I don't believe it's well-controlled at this time. So I want to go ahead and increase the norvask up to 10 milligrams a day, and I want to go ahead and order an echocardiogram and a lipid panel, okay?\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Hey, Dragon, order an echocardiogram. And for your third problem, your rotator cuff repair, I think you're doing really well with that. I would just continue with the exercises and I don't think we need to intervene upon that anymore. It sounds like that's pretty much resolved, okay?\n[patient]  Good. Good.\n[doctor]  Do you have any questions about anything?\n[patient]  No questions.\n[doctor]  Okay great.

You've got normal pulses and everything else is normal. Any numbness or tingling in that right arm.\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  Okay, so what we're going to have to do, the good thing about these kinds of fractures is generally, they will heal up without surgery. But we have to put you in a sling that weighs your arm down and pulls it down. So we're going to put you in a long arm cast and a sling, and then we're going to check you in two weeks to see if those bones have reallined. And if they haven't, then we're going to have to talk about doing surgery at that time.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  I'm going to prescribe you some pain medicine. We'll do Lorde Tab 500, Lorde Tab 5 milligram.\n[doctor]  You can take one to two tablets every six hours as needed for pain. I'll give you 20 of those.\n[patient]  All right.\n[doctor]  And do you have any allergies to medicines? I didn't ask.\n[patient]  No, I don't have no allergies.\n[doctor]  Okay. Hey, dragon, go ahead and order any medications or procedures discussed. Do you have any questions for me?\n[patient]  No, I don't.\n[doctor]  Okay great. Why don't you come with me?

I'm doing okay except for my elbow here.\n[doctor]  Alright, so it's your right elbow?\n[patient]  Is my ride elbow yes?\n[doctor]  Okay. Hey dragon, MS. Hernandez is a 48 year old female here for a ride elbow. So tell me what happened.\n[patient]  Well, I was, um, moving to a new home.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  And I was moving boxes from the truck into the house and I lifted a box up and then I felt like this popping.\n[doctor]  Hmm.\n[patient]  and this strain as I was lifting it up onto the shelf.\n[doctor]  Okay. And when, when did this happen?\n[patient]  This was just yesterday.\n[doctor]  All right, and have you tried anything for it? I mean...\n[patient]  I put ice on it, and I've been taking ibuprofen, but it still hurts a lot.\n[doctor]  Okay, what makes it better or worse?\n[patient]  The ice when I have it on is better.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  But as soon as you know I take it off then it starts throbbing and hurting again.\n[doctor]  All right, let's review your past medical history. Looks like you've got a history of anaphylaxis. Is that correct?\n[patient]  Yes. Yes, I do. Yeah.\n[doctor]  Do you take any medications for it?\n[patient]  Um, just an happy pen.\n[doctor]  just Epipen for anaphylaxis when you need it. Um, and what surgeries have you had before?\n[patient]  Yeah, so carotid. Yeah.\n[doctor]  Yeah, no. Your next surgery. All right. Well, let's examine you here for a second. So it's your... This elbow right here?\n[patient]  Yeah.\n[doctor]  And is it hurt? Tender right around that area?\n[patient]  Yes it is.\n[doctor]  Okay. Can you flex it or can you bend it?\n[patient]  It hurts when I do that, yeah.\n[doctor]  Alright, and go ahead and straighten out as much as you can.\n[patient]  That's about it.\n[doctor]  Alright.\n[patient]  Yeah.\n[doctor]  So there's some swelling there. And how about, uh, can you move your fingers okay? Does that hurt?\n[patient]  No, that's fine.\n[doctor]  How about right over here?\n[patient]  Oh no, that's fine. Yeah.\n[doctor]  Okay, so on exam you've got some tenderness over your lateral epicon dial. You have some swelling there and some redness. You have some pain with flexion, extension of your elbow as well. And you have some pain on the dorsal aspect of your form as well. Okay, so let's look at your x-rays. Hey, dragon, show me the x-rays. All right, your x-ray of your elbow. It looks like I mean the bones are lined up properly. There's no fracture.\n[doctor]  There's a little bit of swelling there on the lateral elbow, but I don't see any fracture, so that's good. So, looking at the x-ray and looking at your exam, my diagnosis here would be lateral epiconDelitis, and this is basically inflammation of this area where this tendon in inserts, and probably that happened when you were moving those boxes. So we'll try some motrin, about 800 milligrams every six hours. I'll give you a sling for comfort, just so you can use it if it's causing a lot of pain.\n[patient]  Oh Oh\n[doctor]  And it should get better in about, you know, in a couple of days it should be improved. And if it doesn't get better, give us a call and we'll see you some time next week. Okay? So we'll give you a sling. We'll give you the motrin. I'll give you about 30 medications for that. Do you have any questions?\n[patient]  No, no. Thank you.\n[doctor]  Hey, dragon, order the medications and the procedures. All right, why don't you come with me and we'll get you signed out.\n[patient]  Okay, sounds good.\n[doctor]  Hey Dragon, finalize the report.",

Are you ready to get started?\n[patient]  I am.\n[doctor]  Okay, Vincent is a 56 year old male here with abnormal lab findings. So I've heard you were in the year, Vincent, and they found that you had a low hemoglobin.\n[patient]  Yep.\n[doctor]  Were you having some dizziness and some lightheadedness?\n[patient]  I was very lightheaded. I don't know. Very lightheaded.\n[doctor]  Okay, and have you noticed bleeding from anywhere?\n[patient]  I have not. I haven't hurt myself in quite a while. Maybe a slight nick from a knife while chopping some onions, but nothing more than that.\n[doctor]  but no blood in your stools or.\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  Anything like that?\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  Okay, and any type of weight loss or decreased appetite or night sweats? Cuffs?\n[patient]  S. Slightly decreased appetite, but I wish I had some weight loss.\n[doctor]  Um, okay. And how about any abdominal pain? Fever chills?\n[patient]  Oh, none of that.\n[doctor]  Okay, alright. An inosia or vomiting.\n[patient]  Not really. Yeah, maybe a bit of nausea.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  I, sitting at the back of a car that makes me nauseous at times.\n[doctor]  Okay, alright. Um, well, how are you doing in terms of your new replacement? I know you had that done last year. That's going okay?\n[patient]  MM, it seems okay. Yeah.\n[doctor]  Okay. You're walking around without a problem?\n[patient]  Yep, yep. Just not good enough to run yet, but everything else works just fine.\n[doctor]  Alright, and I know a few years ago you had had that scare with the possible uncancer, but then they did the biopsy and and you've been fine.\n[patient]  Yup, yup. All good.\n[doctor]  Turned out to be benign.\n[patient]  Yep.\n[doctor]  Okay, great. Alright. Well, let's go ahead and do a quick physical exam. So looking at you, you don't appear in any distress. Your heart is regular. Your lungs sound nice and clear. You have some tenderness to the right lower quadrant to palpation of your abdomen. Your lower extremities have no edema.\n[doctor]  Oh, alright. Well, let's go ahead and look at your labs, okay?\n[patient]  Yep.\n[doctor]  Hey, Dragon, show me the hemoglobin. Yeah, so your hemoglobin is 8.2, which is quite low for somebody of your height and weight, so we'll have to look into that a little bit further. I know that they did the endoscopy in the emergency room. Hey, Dragon, show me the endoscope results.\n[doctor]  Good. So it looks like you had some gastritis, which is just inflammation of your stomach, and they also found a slight polyp, which I know that they biopsyde, and the results are pending at this time. So you may have had some bleeding from the gastritis. It's not usual for people to have bleeding from that.\n[doctor]  Um, okay. Well, hey dragon, show me the anemia panel. Okay.\n[doctor]  Anyway, okay. Well, Vincent, I think, you know, in terms of my impression of you is that you've had this new found anemia, and for that, I think that we should go ahead and put you on Prodynx, 40 milligrams, once a day to help with the gastritis. Does that sound okay to you?\n[patient]  It does. You're the doctor. I don't know what it is.\n[doctor]  So that's just what we call a proton pump inhibitor, which helps decrease the amount of acid secreted within your stomach.\n[patient]  Got it. Make sense.\n[doctor]  Hey, hey dragon, order prognics, 40 milligrams once a day.\n[doctor]  And I'd like you to try to cut down on your caffeine because that can also irritate your stomach. Try not to take any ibuprofen and try to cut down on any alcohol intake, okay?\n[patient]  Yep, yep. The coffee's the hard part.\n[doctor]  Yeah, it always is. How about 1, 1, 1, 8 ounce cup a day? Okay?\n[patient]  Sure.\n[doctor]  And we'll go ahead and we'll see you in a couple weeks, okay?\n[patient]  Sure thing.\n[doctor]  I'm going through, I'll also order another CBC on you. Hey, Dragon, order a complete blood count.\n[doctor]  All right, the nurse will be in soon. It's, you know, settle all that.

How are you?\n[doctor]  I'm pretty good. So it looks like you've completed the COVID vaccine. That's great.\n[patient]  Yes, I did.\n[doctor]  Anything new since your last visit?\n[patient]  No, I did all the tests that you had recommended me to take. I haven't been able to take the thyroid medicine, the one that you prescribed, as I'm still taking my old one. The price was a little high on the new one.\n[doctor]  Okay so did, did you try the coupon that I gave you?\n[patient]  i did not try the coupon uh... there's a charge of seventy five dollars\n[doctor]  Okay, well next time that coupon should help and it should only be about $3.\n[patient]  Okay, um, I don't have it. Do you happen to have another one you can give me?\n[doctor]  Yep, right here.\n[patient]  Wonderful. Thank you so much. And and then the gel they are charging me $100 for it. So I don't know if this is because it's it's Walmart or if I should try somewhere else or maybe you know how or where I can get cheaper.\n[doctor]  Yeah, let's try something else. Sometimes it can be cheaper if we just prescribe you the individual ingredients of a medication rather than the combined medication itself.\n[patient]  That would be great.\n[doctor]  So that's Clinton, Mice and Gel and Benzowell Paroxide. Maybe by doing them separately, they could be a lot cheaper. So that we can do. The Unitroid with the discount code should only be about $9 for 90 days.\n[patient]  Okay, that'll be great. Yeah, they were charging me $75 and I just couldn't pay that.\n[doctor]  Maybe we'll try different pharmacy as well.\n[patient]  Okay, so do you think that my weight gain could have been the birth control that I was taking before that caused it?\n[doctor]  Maybe. I don't really see an endocrine cause for it, at least, so I would need to see the hyperandrogenism or high testosterone, or a high DHEA to cause acne or hair growth or any of that stuff. But the numbers aren't showing up out of range.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  I really don't see any endocrine cause for it, like I said. Your growth hormone was fine, but we definitely want to and need to treat it. Um, I don't know if we talked about maybe a little weight loss study.\n[patient]  You mentioned the weight loss study and you mentioned that I have some meal plans that you had given me. I still have those too.\n[doctor]  Have you tried to make any changes in the diet since the last time we spoke?\n[patient]  I'll start back at the gym in July because of my contract I had to put a hold on it until then.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  So I do want to start doing that. I will be a little freer since I'll be on vacation after July 8th.\n[doctor]  Okay, good.\n[patient]  And then my cousin was telling me to ask you about CLA because it's supposed to help your metabolism. Is that okay to take?\n[doctor]  I'm not sure. What is C, CLA?\n[patient]  I'm not sure what it is either.\n[doctor]  Okay, well, I'm unfamiliar with it, so...\n[patient]  Okay, I also have a co-worker who has thyroid issue 2, and she suggested to try chromium for weight loss.\n[doctor]  So, that likely will not help too much. You can try either if you really want to, but then it will not accept you into the weight law study if you try those too.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Chromium is just a supplement and it won't help that much.\n[patient]  It won't okay, thank you.\n[doctor]  It won't hurt. Okay, I shouldn't say that it won't hurt, but it also won't help that much. So, it's up to you.\n[patient]  Okay, and so my cousin also suggested amino acids and that I might find them in certain foods, I guess, for my workout.\n[doctor]  Yeah, amino acids are fine. They won't really help with weight loss either, but it might help you replenish and just kind of feel hydrated.\n[patient]  Okay, are they proteins? Um, my cousin said she had lost some weight and has been working out every day, but she doesn't work, so I don't know.\n[doctor]  Yes, amino acids are what make up the protein, which is in any food you eat with any protein. So meat, dairy, nuts, any of that sort of thing.\n[patient]  Okay, thank you. Got it.\n[doctor]  All right. Are you allergic to any medications?\n[patient]  No, not that I know of.\n[doctor]  Okay. Is your skin pretty sensitive?\n[patient]  Yes.\n[doctor]  Alright.\n[patient]  um yeah my size i will start getting rashes with different products\n[doctor]  And have you ever tried clindamycin topical as an antibiotic for your acne?\n[patient]  No, I've never tried anything for it.\n[doctor]  Okay, we might give you some of that.\n[patient]  Okay, and I also want to mention that my feet do swell up a lot.\n[doctor]  Okay, let me take a look at that for just a moment. Any constipation?\n[patient]  Yes, I also do have that problem.\n[doctor]  Alright, Mira, Miralox will definitely help with that.\n[patient]  Okay, yes, my doctor did also recommend that.\n[doctor]  Great! Alright, let's do an exam real quick. Please have a seat on this table and I'll listen to your lungs and heart.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  All right, deep breath. All right, again.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Alright sounds good.\n[patient]  Great!\n[doctor]  Let me take a look at your feet and ankles.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Alright, they look okay right now. Certainly let your doctor know about this if it gets any worse or reoccurs.\n[patient]  Okay, I will do that.\n[doctor]  Now, let's go over your lab work. So, when you took that pill, the Dexamethasone test, you passed, which means you don't have Cushing syndrome. On that test, at least, the salivary cortisol, though, unless you did one wrong, two of them were completely normal and one was abnormal. So we might need to repeat that in the future.\n[patient]  Okay, that's okay.\n[doctor]  All right, so your cholesterol was quite high. The total cholesterol was 222. The good cholesterol was about 44. The bad was 153, and it should be less than 100. The non-HDL was about 178, and it should be less than 130. The good cholesterol should be over 50, and it was 44. So your screen for diabetes is fine. You do have a vitamin D deficiency, and I don't know if we started the vitamin D yet or not.\n[patient]  Yes, we did. I don't need to take one today, though.\n[doctor]  Okay, so I also checked a lot of other pituitary hormones, iron levels, everything else seemed to be pretty good and in decent range.\n[patient]  Okay, that sounds great. So I wanted to also show you my liver enzymes because I haven't come back since then, but I was also happy because one of them was back to normal.\n[doctor]  Okay, great. Let's see them.\n[patient]  Okay, so the one that's 30, that was almost 200 not so long ago.\n[doctor]  Yeah, your alt was about 128.\n[patient]  Okay, and back in October was 254.\n[doctor]  Yeah, this is much better.\n[patient]  Okay, great. And then it dropped in January and then it dropped a little more in March since I stopped taking the medicine in December.\n[doctor]  Okay, that's good. So, I'm proud of you with the course of your labs. So, before I forget, I'm going to just put your labs into the computer today and I won't be checking your vitamin D level for some time.\n[patient]  Okay, so with the thyroid and the low vitamin D, does that always happen together?\n[doctor]  I do have a lot of people that have thyroid, thyroid issues and they have vitamin D deficiency.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  This is what I'm going to do. I'm going to put print out your prescriptions so you can shop around at the pharmacies and see if you can find better prices.\n[patient]  Okay, that way I can go ask them and try CVS.\n[doctor]  Yeah, that sounds like a plan.\n[patient]  Okay, good. So the weight loss study that you mentioned, when does that start? Or how does that work?\n[doctor]  So, we are about to start as we just got approval last week and we are just waiting on our paperwork so we can get started.\n[patient]  Okay, and what's involved with that?\n[doctor]  So it'll involve you receiving a medication which has been used for diabetes treatment and it works mostly in the gut on satiety or satiety hormones. The most common side effects are going to be nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and constipation. They are S, uh, six arms to the study. One is a placebo. The other ones are a various as various dosages of the medication. Excuse me. You would receive an injection once a week. Also, keep in mind that most of the weight loss medications are not covered by insurance.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  So it's a way of getting them, but the odds of getting one of the arms with the medication that are in your favor, right, might be only one out of five of our hundred patients that we have on the list for the study that will receive the placebo.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Does that make sense?\n[patient]  Yes, it does.\n[doctor]  So we do expect pretty big weight loss because of what we learn in diabetes study. So it's a year-long process and it's an injection once a week. You come in weekly for the first four, five weeks, I believe. And then after that, it's once a month. You do get a stipend for partissi for participating in the study and parking is validated and whatever else that you need for the study.\n[patient]  Okay, do you know how much the steipand is?\n[doctor]  I will have to double check for you and you don't have to be my patient. You just have to meet the criteria. So the criteria is a BMI greater than 30 if you don't have any other medical condition or a BMI greater than 27. If you do have another medical condition like your cholesterol, a BMI greater than 27 would qualify you.\n[patient]  I have a friend who might be interested, and she does have diabetes.\n[doctor]  If she has de-diabetes, then she won't qualify.\n[patient]  Okay, you can't if you have diabetes, got it.\n[doctor]  Correct. Yeah, the only thing that they cannot have really is diabetes. So either a psychiatric disease or schizophrenia bipolar things like that.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  But if they have hypertension, high cholesterol, things like that, they can definitely sign up.\n[patient]  and they can't okay. Thank you for explaining that.\n[doctor]  Of course. So do you want me to try to get you into that study? Or would you just like to try me to prescribe something? It's kind of up to you.\n[patient]  I think I'll just wait for a little bit now.\n[doctor]  All right, sounds good. I'll give you the information for the research. It's just in my office. It is a different phone number, though. So then, if you're interested, just call us within a month because I don't know how long the weight will be.\n[patient]  Okay, we'll do.\n[doctor]  Perfect. So let me go grab your discount card for the Unitroid. When you go into Activate it, the instructions are on this card and then you use your insurance, then show them this and ask how much it'll cost. If it's too expensive, just let me know.\n[patient]  I will. Thank you so much for your help on that.\n[doctor]  You're welcome. Then what I did is I gave you a topical antibiotic, plus I gave you the benzoyl peroxide. So the peroxide may bleach your sheets, but you want to make sure to take it and apply it at night so you don't have a reaction from the sun during the day.\n[patient]  Okay, I can do that.\n[doctor]  But you do also want to make sure that you don't mess up your sheets.\n[patient]  Okay, sounds good.\n[doctor]  So that's that. And then let's see how you do on the other medications. I think this will, this will get better. In the meantime, a low carb diet, avoid alcohol and fatty foods and low chole cholesterol foods.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  And again, once you finish your dose of vitamin D for the vitamin D deficiency, you're going to start with the 2000 IU daily so that you're able to maintain those levels. Sound good?\n[patient]  Yes, that sounds great.\n[doctor]  I really think your liver enzymes are going to get better once you lose the weight, though.\n[patient]  Okay, that'll be great.\n[doctor]  Since we stopped your birth control we can try once called fexi which is kind of like a spermicide, basically.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  and you just apply it before intercourse.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  If you need some, just let me know.\n[patient]  Okay, I will. I'll let you know.\n[doctor]  Okay, perfect. So stay put for me now. I'm going to go see if they have discount samples and bring you that prescription. And then I'm going to order the labs for next time.\n[patient]  Okay, great. Thank you so much.\n[doctor]  You're welcome.\n[doctor]  So, under the plan, under abnormal liver enzymes, they have improved since discontinuation of her birth control. Under abnormal weight gain, her dexamethasone suppression test was normal. Two out of three salivary cortisol tests were normal, not consistent with cushings, and therefore we're ruling out cushings. Under her hersutism, her androgen levels were normal. For the acne vulgaris, the epigewa was not covered, so we'll try benzoel peroxide with clindamycin and remove the previous information. On the hyperthyroidism, we'll print out her prescriptions. Uniteroid should be better priced with a discount card, and we'll repeat levels of everything before next visit. Thanks.",

            "src": "[doctor]  This is Philip Gutierrez, date of birth January 12, 71. He is a 50-year-old male here for a second opinion regarding the index finger on the right hand. He had a hyper extension injury of that index finger during a motor vehicle accident in March of this year. He was offered an injection of the A1 polyregion, but did not want any steroid because of the reaction to Dexamethasone, which causes his heart to race. He was scheduled to see Dr. Alice Davis, which it doesn't appear he did. He had an MRI of that finger because there was concern about a capsular strain plus or minus rupture of, quote, FDS tendon, end quote. He has been seen at Pointe-May orthopedics largely by the physical therapy staff and a PR pod that institution.\n[doctor]  At that practice, an MRI was obtained on April 24, 2021, which showed just focal soft tissue swelling over the right index and CP joint, partial thickness tear of the right FDS, and fluid consistent with tenosinovitis around the FDP and FDS tendons. Radial and ulnar collateral ligaments of the index and CP joint were intact, as the MCP joint capsule. Extensor tendons also deemed intact.\n[doctor]  His X-rays, for views of the right hand today, show no boni abnormalities. Join congruency throughout all lesser digits on the right hand. No soft tissue shadows of concern. No arthritis. Hi, are you Mr. Gutierrez?\n[patient]  I'm good, how about you?\n[doctor]  Well, how can I help you today?\n[patient]  So I was a passenger in a car that was rear-ended and we were hit multiple times. I felt two bumps which slung me forward and caused me to stretch out my right index finger.\n[doctor]  So hitting the car in front of you all made that finger go backwards.\n[patient]  Um, I don't really know. I just felt like it felt like I laid on my finger and so I felt like it went back and it's been hurting since about March. And it's been like that ever, ever since the wreck happened. So I, and I can't make a fist, but sometimes the pain's unbearable. And like, even driving hurts.\n[doctor]  Okay, so this was March of this year. So maybe about three months ago?\n[patient]  Yeah, and it's still swollen. So I was seeing an orthopedist and they sent me to an occupational therapist. And I've been doing therapy with them. And then they sent me to go back and get an MRI. So I went and got the MRI. Then they told me that the MRI came back and it said I had a tear in my finger, but he wasn't going to give me an injection because the injection was going to make the tear worse.\n[doctor]  Mm.\n[patient]  And then after he got the MRI, he said that I have a tear on my finger and that he didn't want to do surgery, but he would do an injection. Then I'm thinking that you told me you wouldn't do an injection in there. And then the opa occupational therapy says it's because of the tear. And then they don't want me to keep rubbing the thing and doing things with my hand. So I feel like I'm not getting medical care, really.\n[doctor]  Yeah, I see that.\n[patient]  So I can't see if you could do anything for this hand because I am right handed and I kind of need that hand.\n[doctor]  What do you do for a living?\n[patient]  Ugh, I'm an X-ray tech.\n[doctor]  Well, so do you have any diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis?\n[patient]  Nope.\n[doctor]  Uh, do you take any chronic medications of Sue? Significance?\n[patient]  I do take a blood pressure pill and that's it.\n[doctor]  Okay, and it looks like you suffer from itching with the methyl prednisolone.\n[patient]  uh... that's correct\n[doctor]  All right, well, I'm going to scoot up closer and just take a quick look at your hand. All right, so lean over here. All right, so on this exam today, we have a very pleasant, cooperative, healthy male, no distress. His heart rate is regular rate, rhythm, two plus radial pulse, no swelling or bruise. Bruising in the palm over the volar surface of his index finger, normal creases, slightly diminished over the hip of the index finger compared to the middle finger.\n[doctor]  His index finger rests in a 10 degree pip flexed position. All right, is that uncomfortable to correct that? And is it uncomfortable now here?\n[patient]  Yeah, uh, when you push on it, yeah.\n[doctor]  Alright, how about here?\n[patient]  uh... there it's not\n[doctor]  Okay, not as bad.\n[patient]  Yeah, it feels a little numb.\n[doctor]  Gotcha, all right. Bend, bend the tip of this finger. Bend it as hard as you can. Keep bending, keep bending. All right, straighten it out. All right, and now bend it for me as best you can.\n[patient]  My goodness, it feels like it's it's tearing in there.\n[doctor]  Okay, okay. Well, bend the tip of this finger and bend it as hard as you can. Keep bending. All right, straighten that out and now bend it for me as best you can. All right, good. Now bend that finger and I'm going to pull, put it down like this and then bend that finger for me. Okay, sorry, can you bend it for me? All right, now make a fist. Great. So relax the finger. All right, so just keep it keep when I bend the finger, we're just going to bend that finger where it meets the hand. Is that okay there?\n[patient]  Ow!\n[doctor]  Okay, okay. So all the hurt, it seems, is stretching because you haven't been doing this for so long. So you know what I mean? So you're going to have to start really doing that.\n[patient]  Well, I've tried. I even bought myself a splint.\n[doctor]  Well, but a splint doesn't help move you. It actually immobilizes you.\n[patient]  Okay, I thought it would straighten it out.\n[doctor]  No, no. So, so you really need to start bending the finger right here for me as hard as you can and keep going going. Alright, so, so you're okay. Alright, so I would say the following that there is a partial tear in one of the two flexor tendons. There is the FDP and the FDS, and the FDS is the least important of the two. So the MRI shows that it's the FDS, the flexor-digitorum superficialis, which is the least important of the two.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Now, there's two halves of it. So it's a partial tear of one half of a whole tendon. That's not that important and the other one is just fine.\n[patient]  So the good one is good.\n[doctor]  Yes, correct. So the one that goes all the way to the tip is good.\n[patient]  Okay, good.\n[doctor]  Yeah, so you know, I think we have got so much scar tissue and inflammation around the FDS tendon blocking excursion of these other tendons that they can't get through to the pulley.\n[patient]  Okay, all right.\n[doctor]  So what I would recommend, what we try is a cortisone injection, and I would avoid the dexamethasone because I saw you have a little reaction to that. But we could use the beta-methasone, which is a cellostone.\n[patient]  I've gotten another methyl prednisolone and that itch me like crazy.\n[doctor]  Did it? Yeah, this one is water soluble and I think it's fairly low toxicity, but high benefit, and I think decreasing the pain will encourage you to move that finger.\n[patient]  Alright, we'll give it try.\n[doctor]  Good. So you do the shot and it's going to take about three to five days before it starts feeling better. And then probably over the next couple of weeks, it'll start feeling even better.\n[patient]  Perfect.\n[doctor]  Alright, so take advantage of that. You've got toss start moving the finger. You're not going to tear anything or break a bone, because your intensers, extensors are intact. But your collateral ligaments are intact, so you've got a stiff sore finger. I'm going to try to help as much as I can with the soreness part, and then you have to do all the stiff part.\n[patient]  The lady in occupational therapy tried some maneuvers to straighten the finger out, but it even hurt after I left. The whole thing just swelled up.\n[doctor]  Hmm. Okay, so it was injured and you had scar tissue. And then you had post-traumatic inflammation. And so this will help some with all of that. It's not going to make it to where your finger is like, my finger doesn't hurt at all, but it will make it to where at least tolerable to where you can make some gains. And we actually might need to repeat this as well.\n[patient]  while I be able to drive, I drove myself here today, so...\n[doctor]  Yeah, it may feel a little weird, but it's totally safe for you to drive.\n[patient]  Okay, good.\n[doctor]  So for Mr. Gudi Euras just put that he is a post-traumatic rather severe stenosing tenocino-bitis of his right index finger and the plan is steroid injection today. Do a trigger injection but I'm using a CC of beta-methasone. So Mr. Gudi Euras do you have therapy scheduled or setup?\n[patient]  uh... not at the moment\n[doctor]  All right, well, I mean, you know that you need to move that finger and I think to the degree that they can help you do that. So I want you to move that finger finger, but I think it would be beneficial for you to have an accountability. So at least you know to check in with them once a week with somebody.\n[patient]  Okay, that's kind of why I'm here for you to tell me what needs to be done, you know?\n[doctor]  Yeah, so I'll write you out, and outpatient prescription. I think if you go back to the same people where you were before, I'm hoping that after this injection, you're going to be able to do a whole lot more with them. So let's do outpatient once a week for six weeks. And then full active and passive range of motion is the goal with no restrictions.\n[patient]  Alright, sounds like a plan.\n[doctor]  All right, well, I will have the nurse set up the injection procedure and wheel and I'll be back shortly.\n[patient]  Thanks, Doc.\n[doctor]  Right trigger finger injection template. Attempted to inject one CC of cellostone with F, a half a CC of lidocaine. However, the patient had a dramatic and violent painful reaction to the introduction of the needle with contortions of the hand and with dangerously withdrawing the hand with concerns for secondary needle stick. Needle was withdrawn. The patient was counseled as to the importance of attempting to get some therapeutic steroid in the flexor tendon and sheath. We attempted a second time for a similar injection using the same technique with one CC of cellostone and half a CC of lidocaine. A small parma, a pulmervane blood a scan amount which was cleaned up and bandaid applied. Reassured on multiple occasions that no harm was done to his finger, recommended icing in it this evening and taking ibuprofen.",

He reports they were hit multiple times as he felt 2 bumps which caused his to sling forward hyperextending his right index finger. He was offered an injection of the A1 pulley region, but he did not want any steroid due to a reaction to dexamethasone that causes his heart to race. The patient was scheduled to see Dr. Alice Davis, but he has not seen his yet. The patient has been seen at Point May Orthopedics, by the physical therapy staff and a physician assistant at that practice. He underwent an MRI of the right index finger because they were concerned about a capsular strain plus or minus a rupture of the \"FDS tendon.\"\n\nThe patient states that he is unable to make a fist secondary to pain and swelling in the right index finger. He describes a pulling, tearing sensation in the right index finger. The pain is exacerbated by driving. He notes that he has been wearing a right index finger splint.\n\nThe patient denies any history of diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis. He reports only taking medication for hypertension and denies taking any other chronic medications of significance. He also notes methylprednisolone causes his to itch.\n\nMs. Gutierrez is employed as an x-ray technician.\n\nPAST HISTORY\n\nMedical\nHypertension.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nEmployed as x-ray technician.\n\nALLERGIES\n\nMethylprednisolone causes itching.\nDexamethasone causes palpitations.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\n\u2022 Musculoskeletal: Right index finger pain.\n\u2022 Endocrine: Denies diabetes.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nConstitutional\nVery pleasant, healthy appearing, cooperative male in no distress.\n\nNeurological\nGrossly intact. Slightly diminished sensation to light touch over the right PIP joint of the index finger compared to the middle finger.\n\nCardiovascular\nRegular rate and rhythm.\n\nMusculoskeletal\nExam of the right hand, there is no swelling or ecchymosis in the palm on the volar surface of his index finger. Normal creases are noted. Index finger rests in a 10 degree PIP joint flexed position with discomfort upon correction. Bilateral extremities 2+ radial pulses.\n\nRESULTS\n\nX-rays today, 4 views of the right hand, show no bony abnormalities. Joint congruency throughout all lesser digits on the right hand. No soft tissue shadows of concern. No arthritis.\n\nMRI of the right index finger performed on 04/24/2021. Independent review of the images shows focal soft tissue swelling over the right index MCP joint, partial-thickness tear of the right FDS, and fluid consistent with tenosynovitis around the FDP and FDS tendons. Radial and ulnar collateral ligaments of the index MCP joint were intact as was the MCP joint capsule. The extensor tendons were also deemed intact.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\n\u2022 Stenosing tenosynovitis of right index finger.\n\nMs. Philip Gutierrez is a pleasant 50-year-old right-hand-dominant male here today for a 2nd opinion of his right index finger hyperextension injury sustained during a motor vehicle accident in March of this year. The findings of his examination are consistent with rather severe post-traumatic stenosing tenosynovitis.\n\nPLAN\n\nThe patient and I had a lengthy discussion regarding his history, symptoms, and radiographic findings. We discussed the pathophysiology and natural history of stenosing tenosynovitis and the anatomy of the flexor tendons and pulley system in the hand. I explained to the patient that the flexor digitorum superficialis tendon was clearly intact and that He is suffering from post-traumatic inflammation around the flexor digitorum superficialis tendon blocking excursion of the flexor tendons to the A1 pulley.\n\nTreatment options were discussed including conservative management with corticosteroid injections and their statistical effectiveness. Surgical correction was also briefly discussed, although I recommend exhausting non-operative measures with a minimum of 2 injections before proceeding with surgery. I recommended a right index trigger finger cortisone injection today, and the patient elected to proceed. I also recommend that the patient report to occupational therapy once a week for the next 6 weeks to work on full active and passive right index finger range of motion with no restrictions.\n\nThe patient verbalizes understanding with the treatment plan and agrees. All questions were answered to the patient's satisfaction today.\n\nPROCEDURE\n\nRight index trigger finger injection.\nThe patient understands the risks and benefits and elected to proceed, signed consent obtained. An attempt was made to inject 1.0 cc of Celestone with 0.5 cc of lidocaine. However, the patient had a dramatic and violent painful reaction to the introduction of the needle with contortions of the hand and with dangerously withdrawing the hand with concerns for secondary needle stick. Therefore, the needle was withdrawn. The patient was counseled as to the importance of attempting to get some therapeutic steroid in the flexor tendon sheath. We attempted a 2nd time for a similar injection using the same technique with 1.0 cc of Celestone and 0.5 cc of lidocaine. There was a small palmar vein that bled a scant amount, which was cleaned up off the back of the patient's hand. A Band-Aid was applied.

Patient was last seen on November 24th, 2020. His notable things are number one. He is on one milliliter every 10 days. His levels were less than 300 to begin with. He's on finasteride currently. He also takes dialysis daily, so he takes all his pills just from me. Patient's other area of concern is gynecomastia, which we will discuss with him today. His last PSA was 0.66, and his last testosterone was greater than 1,500.\n[doctor]  Hey, how are you today?\n[patient]  Alright, how have you been?\n[doctor]  I'm good.\n[patient]  Good good\n[doctor]  Have you lost some weight or are you at least putting on some muscle? You look trim.\n[patient]  No, I think I'm pretty much the same as I've always been.\n[doctor]  Really? Okay, maybe it's just your black shirt. Makes you look thin.\n[patient]  Yeah, I guess that's it.\n[doctor]  So, health wise, how is everything going?\n[patient]  Good, the testosterone's going well.\n[doctor]  That's great.\n[patient]  It helped me out. I feel good, more vigorous, sleeping well, and I think it's having some positive effects. Not so much physically because like I said, I've been this way my whole life, but I'm seeing some good improvements in my blood work.\n[doctor]  Okay, well that's good.\n[patient]  So the finasteride, I'm only taking half a pill. It's the 5 milligram one.\n[doctor]  Yeah, I remember you telling me that.\n[patient]  and sialless on the days i work out i take five milligrams otherwise i take two and a half milligram pills but uh i have been out of it\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  But overall I'm doing well. I'm actually taking the correct steps to get my life together.\n[doctor]  Good. It's always great to hear. Well, let's take a look. Um, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Please use my general exam template. All right. Just take a few breaths.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  In and out.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Alright, everything sounds good. No concerns there.\n[patient]  Great, so I wanted to show you something.\n[doctor]  Sure.\n[patient]  Look at this.\n[doctor]  Okay, this is your cholesterol?\n[patient]  Yeah, my cholesterol and triglycerides. Uh, I used to have high triglycerides. You see, they were 265 milligrams per desolate, and I took my first dose of the testosterone on the 28th.\n[doctor]  Right.\n[patient]  Now, five months later, look at my numbers.\n[doctor]  Wow, that's remarkable.\n[patient]  Is it the test? It's the only change.\n[doctor]  I don't know, I haven't honestly seen many guys over the years that have cholesterol problems and this. I mean, there's a big correlation between diabetic control and testosterone replacement, meaning those who get good levels of their tests see their diabetic control improve.\n[patient]  Yeah.\n[doctor]  But I haven't seen a lot of data on the impact on cholesterol. Regardless, we will take it.\n[patient]  I agree. I was very impressed with my triglycerides and was just wondering if the test maybe was helping.\n[doctor]  Yeah, that's an unbelievable difference.\n[patient]  145 milligrams per desolate from 265 milligrams per desolate is awesome. I also read that it's cardio protective.\n[doctor]  Absolutely.\n[patient]  My red blood cell count has increased.\n[doctor]  Yeah, I saw that. It's fine though.\n[patient]  stable\n[doctor]  Your PSA today is also, is good also. It's 0.6 I think.\n[patient]  Yeah, is it?\n[doctor]  yeah it was point five last year and anything under four is good\n[patient]  Nice, that's good news.\n[doctor]  So, it just needs to be checked every year or so.\n[patient]  So in terms of estrogen control, I've been hearing that in dull, three carbonyl or broccoli extract, supposedly can improve my estrogen levels. Have you ever heard of it?\n[doctor]  Yeah, I've heard of it, but I haven't had anybody consistently use it. I mean, your levels are fine, and we checked your Estra Estra Dial, and it was not elevated, so.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  I would argue that we could test that in the fall if you want, but we don't need to do. Do any more tests, any more than test once a year, excuse me.\n[patient]  Okay, what about increasing my testosterone to 175 milligrams? I'm at 140 now.\n[doctor]  Well, your levels are high.\n[patient]  Are they right now?\n[doctor]  Well, I mean they were last time.\n[patient]  Yeah, but I just just injected though or I had right before that was taken.\n[doctor]  I know. I know you had then, uh, when did you inject this time?\n[patient]  I figure I'm on my eighth day today.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  So I'm due to dose on Thursday or Friday.\n[doctor]  Alright.\n[patient]  I have a little Med calendar and I put checks and T.S. on it. That helps me.\n[doctor]  That's a great idea. So look, the biggest issue I've seen, even if your levels today are around 700, is that your peaks are getting greater than 1,500, putting you at a higher chance of needing to come off due to blood thickness. And your risk will only astronomically go up the higher the dose that we go on.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  You look well, your levels are good and you're feeling well.\n[patient]  Yeah, I'm feeling good.\n[doctor]  I'm going to be blunt. Unfortunately, this happens often where you're feeling good, but you want to feel really good. I mean, I get it, and this is why people get into problems with this stuff, right? It's like back in the day when it wasn't prescribed by doctors and people would get it at gyms and stuff, and they would take huge doses. And then they would have a heart attack at 50.\n[patient]  Yeah, they have to be taking a lot.\n[doctor]  likely they are taking more than testosterone but still.\n[patient]  and they're taking stuff for a long time.\n[doctor]  True. But right now I would not change your dose.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Make sense?\n[patient]  It does, I appreciate the discussion.\n[doctor]  No problem. What pharmacy are you using? Have you changed it or anything?\n[patient]  No changes, I use Walmart Pharmacy. I don't need more psialis and finasteride.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  I would prefer the paper prescription.\n[doctor]  for all of them.\n[patient]  Sure.\n[doctor]  Alright, we'll do. I'm gonna get your prescriptions.\n[patient]  Okay, thank you.",

He was last seen on 11/24/2020. The patient\u2019s history includes positive for HIV, and today he is concerned with gynecomastia.\n\nThe patient is doing well, overall, and feels the testosterone is helping. He reports weight stability, feels lively, good, more vigorous, and he is sleeping well. He also thinks the testosterone is having a positive effect on his blood work. He endorses that his triglycerides have always been elevated and adds that they were as high as 265 mg/dL. The patient presented a copy of his bloodwork, showing a significant decrease in his cholesterol after 5 months. Mr. Edwards questioned if the changes in his blood work were due to the testosterone. He also noted that his red blood cell count has not increased. The patient inquired about possible benefits of Indole-3-carbinol, which is a broccoli extract for estrogen control.\n\nCurrently, the patient is dosing 140 ng/dL of testosterone per week and inquired if his dose could be increased to 175 ng/dL. He recalled that he had recently injected testosterone before his last testosterone blood work was performed; last testosterone levels were greater than 1500 ng/dL. The patient confirms continued daily use of Finasteride and Cialis, prescribed by me, and stated he needs a refill for both.\n\nMr. Edwards mentioned he is taking correct steps to get his life \"together.\" He also uses a med calendar to help with medication compliance.\n\nPAST HISTORY\n\nMedical\nHIV\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nUtilizes med calendar to support medication compliance.\nActively trying to get his life together.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS\n\nCialis 5 mg tablet by mouth on days he exercises, 2.5 mg tablet by mouth on days without exercise.\nFinasteride 5 mg half tablet daily.\nTestosterone cypionate 140 mg.\n\nRESULTS\n\nPSA 0.6 ng/mL.\nTriglycerides 145 mg/dL.\nTotal testosterone 1500 ng/dL, 11/24/2021.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\n\u2022 Hypogonadism.\n\nPLAN\n\nI recommend maintaining current management.

He requested an increase to his testosterone cypionate from 140 mg to 175 mg, which I denied due to his already high testosterone levels. I counseled the patient on the risks associated with high testosterone levels and Indole-3-carbinol and it\u2019s lacking evidence to support his estrogen levels. The last time his estradiol levels were checked, they were normal; recommend annual screening.\n\nI provided paper prescription refills for Cialis and Finasteride.\n",

The incisions are well healed though with no signs of infection or any redness on either breast, so I'm not concerned.\n[patient]  Yeah, but this one just bothered me a little bit more.\n[doctor]  I understand. You can close your gown now.\n[doctor]  The only thing that is really going to help out that is to cut it out and reclose it.\n[doctor]  And you don't want that.\n[patient]  I mean not right now.\n[doctor]  You want to come back and revisit maybe six months?\n[patient]  Yeah, I will do that. I still have it. I still have some more of the gel and I can try using that again.\n[doctor]  Okay, keep doing that twice a day. The gel is going to lighten the color a little bit, which is already pretty light, but just in that area and it's high tension so it's going to rub a little bit.\n[patient]  Yeah, but it kind of bothers me a little bit.\n[doctor]  I do see that. Like I said, the only way to really fix that is to cut it out.\n[patient]  Ah!\n[doctor]  Let's take a look in six months and then we'll go from there. Sound like a plan?\n[patient]  But we haven't hit a full year yet.\n[doctor]  I know. I wouldn't do any revisions anyway for scar tissue until we're at least a year out anyway.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  So let's wait those six months. You can keep using the MetaMascar gel twice a day. Massage and Scar gel will help for the scars. You can put it on other scars too if you need.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  So that's what I would do. Let's just get some pictures today so we can keep up with them and keep an eye on these scars and then we'll go from there.\n[patient]  Sound good.\n[doctor]  Alright, well it's good to see you. I'm glad you're doing well.\n[patient]  Yeah, same here.\n[doctor]  All right, well, I'm going to tell the front desk six months and we'll revisit those scars.\n[patient]  All right.\n[doctor]  Thank you. They're going to come get your photos now, okay?\n[patient]  Okay.",

            "src": "[doctor]  Next patient is Nicole Miller. Date of birth is September 18, 1949. Patient was called for a follow-up with me for chronic congestive heart failure, with diastolic dysfunction. BMP spin, uh, 3,000 in March, and is about six was up to 6,000 in April. She was increasingly dyspneic. We changed her furostomide and torsomide 20 milligrams by mouth daily. A to note, the patient is not currently on potassium supplement. Her lysinoprol had, has also been increased up to 10 milligrams daily in March. Also did when I saw her last April. She reported being interested in having her right knee replace this summer at East Metro. It was recommended that we work to control her cardiovascular status before surgery.\n[doctor]  Hey Miss Miller, how are you today?\n[patient]  I'm doing okay. Thank you.\n[doctor]  I asked you to come in today because we want to keep, we want you to have this knee surgery this summer, but we want to keep a close eye on you to make sure a week before your surgery. You don't suddenly go into congestive heart failure and it gets postponed.\n[patient]  Yeah, that would not be good.\n[doctor]  I see your scheduled on the 24th for surgery.\n[patient]  Yeah, that's right.\n[doctor]  Okay, good. Well, it looks like you have lost about three, three and a half pounds since I saw you last in April. Some of that might be water weight, but still, this is positive.\n[patient]  Yeah, I noticed that too. I think the oxyglydamine is helping as well. My urgency to use the bathroom is much better.\n[doctor]  Well that's great.\n[patient]  Yeah, I'm pleased about it too.\n[doctor]  You ever get leg or finger cramps or anything like that.\n[patient]  Yeah, I had leg cramps the other day, but I thought it was maybe just because I was cold as I had my ceiling fan on and fell asleep. I had cramps when I woke up in both legs right here. On my drank pickle juice and it went right away.\n[doctor]  Well, don't, don't get crazy with the pickle juice because all of the salt in it.\n[patient]  Ha ha, I know. I'd only drink about four ounces or so.\n[doctor]  Okay good.\n[patient]  I'm at one away, so I didn't drink anymore. I find it works a lot better than trying to put some cream on my leg.\n[doctor]  Sure, just keep it in moderation.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  And then are you still on an iron supplement? And are you using the bathroom okay?\n[patient]  Yes, everything is good.\n[doctor]  Good. How is your heart burn doing? Any problems with that?\n[patient]  No, it did get bad for a while, so I tried to take some Prylasek and then stop that other one.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  I might did that for like gosh, I think it was two weeks back in January and haven't had any problems since.\n[doctor]  Great!\n[patient]  Um, and after I stopped taking that, I went back to the stomach one. So I'm doing good now.\n[doctor]  Okay, and you're still due for a colonoscopy, correct?\n[patient]  But yeah, that's right.\n[doctor]  Alright, let's review your blood work real quick. I checked your hemoglobin level because you have had some anemia in the past, but that is still doing great.\n[patient]  Good, that's a relief to hear.\n[doctor]  Your potassium is 3.9, so it's holding study on the torsimide. Your creatinine was 0.7, 0.8, so you're doing well with kidney numbers. Your bun may be a tiny bit elevated at 23, which is the number we look for for dehydration sometimes the kidneys, but it's not terrible. So when I look at your numbers as a whole, I think you're tolerating the torsimide okay at the current dose. I also sent out to look at the heart failure number. I sent to look at your heart failure number. There is a test called a BMP that I was monitoring, and in March it was up to 3000, and then went up to 6000 in April before I made the change. I'm still waiting for those results.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  All in all I think you're doing good on paper though.\n[patient]  What about on what's it called a 1C? Does that show up?\n[doctor]  I don't think I ordered it, but I could. Your last A1C was 5.5 in March.\n[patient]  Alrighty\n[doctor]  So your blood sugar is a little bit high. It was 169 today, but that kind of depends on what you ate and you weren't fasting for the blood check. So I might have to repeat that test for preop, but I don't think we need to do it today.\n[patient]  Alrighty, that sounds good.\n[doctor]  I checked your magnesium level because sometimes you will urinate out magnesium with the water pills, but it was normal at 1.7 and your blood pressure is also looking good.\n[patient]  Okay, great. That all sounds awesome.\n[doctor]  All right, let's take a quick lesson.\n[doctor]  Use my General Physical Exam Template.\n[doctor]  and take a couple of deep breaths for me.\n[doctor]  Your lungs sound pretty good to me, so keep doing what you're doing. I'm, uh, like I said, I think you're doing good overall, but let's just talk about a few things.\n[patient]  Alrighty\n[doctor]  So we often like to keep people with heart problems on magnesium and get their levels up to around the two-ish range. Yours is a little bit less than two and we want that two-ish range because it can help stabilize the heart muscle. So I might recommend putting you on magnesium supplement. It's supposed to be twice a day so that's kind of annoying but I know you're on other medicines twice a day too so I think you'll do fine.\n[patient]  Yeah, that'll be okay.\n[doctor]  Great! Now, before surgery, we'll have to get you off your clopidogrel for a week beforehand.\n[patient]  Yes, okay, I have everything written down on my phone and I have a letter taped to the side of my bed to remind me.\n[doctor]  Perfect. We will give you a reminder as well. We will also need to complete a pre-op check within two weeks of your surgery during the first or second week of June.\n[patient]  Okay, I'll put that down.\n[doctor]  You might also have to repeat an EKG before surgery, which we could do today. I know I'm sure it feels like you're doing, you're always doing EKGs. And we don't need to any x-rays of your chest because you had one recently and we don't need any more blood work because we did that today.\n[patient]  Yeah, I do a lot of EKGs. I'm basically a regular, but I'm happy to do one today. No problem.\n[doctor]  Lastly, once we get your knee surgery, we should think about getting you a colonoscopy. We can do it here locally because you have Medicare. Do you have private insurance also?\n[patient]  Yeah, I have both.\n[doctor]  Okay, so yes, you can get it your colonoscopy wherever you'd like.\n[patient]  Okay, well my husband's insurance may be running out. Might we be able to get the procedure done sooner? Maybe in the next 30 days? Is that okay?\n[doctor]  Am I can put it in right now for county for the next 30 days and they might be able to get you in within the next few weeks? It should not take, it should not make you ineligible for the surgery. In other words, completing a colonoscopy would not delay your surgery.\n[patient]  Okay, good.\n[doctor]  So let me see. I've been doing one of two things that everyone and everyone is great, so it depends more on timing availability of their or for the colonoscopy. We can send you to Dr. Martin for the surgery, who is at county surgical services down here, or the other option is Valley Medical, and they do it at Springfield.\n[patient]  Okay, that sounds good.\n[doctor]  I think either direction they're good technicians of the colon.\n[patient]  Okay, whatever you can get me in, that works great.\n[doctor]  So I'll call around. Now if you get that done and they tell you 10 years then you'll be good to go.\n[patient]  Great, thank you.\n[doctor]  You're welcome. Have a great day. Let us know if you need anything else, okay?\n[patient]  Sound good.\n[doctor]  All right, assessment and plan.\n[doctor]  Chronic CHF, mixed presentation, had exacerbation of CF, CHF earlier in the spring. We switched her from a furocemide to torsimide, and symptomatically she's doing a lot better. She's about three, three and a half pounds down in weight. Breathing is non-labored, going to repeat EKG today, but otherwise continue with her current regimen. Lobbs checked and creatinine is appropriate.\n[doctor]  A number two, pre-op examination. She is having a right knee replacement end of June. Also, she would like to have a colonoscopy performed, which we'll try to have done at a Bartley Regional, rightly regional hospital in the next month, prior to a change in her insurance. This is just a screening colonoscopy that she is overdue for. No family history of colon cancer.\n[doctor]  The next one is diabetes. A1c is 5.1 on the last check, so no need for further A1c today. She may need another one prior to her surgery next month though. Thanks.",

            "src": "[doctor]  Dictating on Donald Clark. Date of birth March 4th, 1937. Chief complaint is left arm pain. Hello, how are you?\n[patient]  Good morning.\n[doctor]  It's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Miller.\n[patient]  It's nice to meet you as well.\n[doctor]  So, I hear you're having pain in this arm. Is that correct?\n[patient]  That's correct.\n[doctor]  Okay, and it seems like it's worse at night.\n[patient]  Well, right now the hand is.\n[doctor]  questions\u0e21\u0e48 \u041d doubled\n[patient]  And the thing started about two weeks ago. I woke up about two o'clock in the morning and it was just hurting something awful.\n[doctor]  Aw.\n[patient]  And then I laid some ice on it and it finally did ease up.\n[doctor]  Okay, that's good.\n[patient]  So I got up, I sat on the side of the bed and held my arm down, thinking it would like help the circulation but it didn't.\n[doctor]  Okay, I see.\n[patient]  And so after a while when it eased off maybe about four, five am, I'll lay back down and it didn't start up again.\n[doctor]  Don't worry.\n[patient]  I went back to sleep, but for several nights this happened like over and over. So I finally want to see the doctor and I don't really recall her name.\n[doctor]  Okay. Yeah, I think I know who you're talking about though.\n[patient]  She's the one who sent me to you, so I would think so. But when I went to her after the third time it happened, and she checked me out, she said it was most likely coming from a pinch nerve.\n[doctor]  Probably. Uh, do you notice that moving your neck or turning your head seems to bother your arm?\n[patient]  Oh no.\n[doctor]  Okay. Is moving your shoulder uncomfortable at all?\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  And do you notice it at other times besides during the night?\n[patient]  Somidese. If it bothers me at night, then the day following, it usually will bother me some.\n[doctor]  Okay. And do you just notice it in the hand or does it seem to be going down the whole arm?\n[patient]  while it starts there and goes all the way down the arm.\n[doctor]  Okay. Have you noticed any weakness in your hand at all?\n[patient]  Oh yes.\n[doctor]  Okay. Like in terms of gripping things?\n[patient]  Yeah.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  Uh, this finger I heard at some time ago as well.\n[doctor]  Really?\n[patient]  Yeah, it doesn't work properly. Or it works very rarely.\n[doctor]  Gotcha. And did I hear that she gave you some prednisone and some oral steroids or?\n[patient]  Uh, well, she gave me some numbing medicine. It helped a little bit. The other two were a neck pill and gabapen. Uh, you should have my full list in your notes though. Since then, it hasn't really bothered me at night. Also, just so, you know, I'm a VA and I'm 1% disabled from this leg. Um, issues from my knees down on my feet.\n[doctor]  Okay. Is it neuropathy?\n[patient]  Oh yeah.\n[doctor]  Gotcha. That is good to know. Alright well, let's go ahead and take a look.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Alright, so to start I'm gonna have you do something for me Just go ahead and tilt your chin as far as you can down to your chest. Okay, good And now go the other way tilting your chin up as far as you can now does that seem to bother you at all? Okay, and now come back to normal just look and turn your head as far as you can that way great And now as far as you can towards that wall Does that seem to bother you at all?\n[patient]  No, well, actually I do feel a little strain.\n[doctor]  Okay, so you feel it in the neck a little bit?\n[patient]  Yeah, just a little string.\n[doctor]  Okay. Uh, now squeeze my fingers as hard as you can with both hands. Great. Now hold your arms like this.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  And I'm going to try to strain your arms and try to keep them as stiff as you can. Don't let me strain it. Okay, good. Good. Now, when I... I'm just touching your hands like this. Does it seem to feel about the same in both hands?\n[patient]  Oh yes.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right. So I do agree with Betty. More than likely, this seems like it would be coming from your neck. That's the most common reason that causes what you're experiencing. And I looked at an x-ray of your neck and you do seem to have a lot of arthritis there, and there does seem to be potential for a disc to be pushing on a nerve. And now what I don't have is an MRI which would show me kind of exactly where the nerve roots are getting pinched off.\n[patient]  I see.\n[doctor]  So, Gabba Penton can help a little bit with the nerve pain, and what I would like to do is potentially set you up for an epidural. And what that is is it's a focused anti-inflammatory medicine, excuse me, that works behind the nerve roots that nerve roots that we are thinking might be getting squished off. It can often help alleviate your symptoms, and I do need to get an MRI of your neck. I know we have had one of your lower back, but I need one of your neck to see exactly where the roots are getting pinched off. So, what I can do is tentatively set you up for an epidural, but before you do that, we do need to get that MRI, so I can see right where I need to put the medicine for your epidural. What do you think of that?\n[patient]  I think that sounds good to me.\n[doctor]  Okay, good. And just to confirm, do you take any blood thinners? I don't think I saw any on your medicine list.\n[patient]  Oh no, I don't.\n[doctor]  Okay, good. And what I would have you do is continue with the GABA PENTAIN. Are you taking 300 or 100?\n[patient]  Um, not sure. My lady friend helps me handle this stuff.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  I'm taking a liquid though.\n[doctor]  Okay, so whatever you're doing you can just keep doing it and I'm going to set you up for the epidural and imaging study Just so I know right where to put the medicine and I will follow up with you after us That's in we can do the shot just to make sure your arm is feeling better sound good\n[patient]  Sounds good. For the last couple of nights, though, my neck has not been bothering me.\n[doctor]  Okay. Us. Um, so presumably what's happening then is when you're sleeping your neck is kind of gets off tilt, uh, kilter and it compresses the nerve roots there. Now if you think you're doing fine, we could hold off, but at the very law at least I'd like to update that MRI of yours and see what's going on because probably this is something that will likely flare up again.\n[patient]  Yeah, it has been for the last week, so I understand.\n[doctor]  Okay, alright. Well, do you want to do that work up and do the epidural? Or do you think you're doing fine? And you want to wait?\n[patient]  Well, my hand is still bothering me.\n[doctor]  Okay, so you're saying your neck is not bothering you, but the hand is. Okay, so then let's just stick with the plan. MRI of the neck, so we can see where the nerve roots may be compressed. That's giving your hand the issue. And then we're going to set you up with the epidural.\n[patient]  Okay, sounds good.\n[doctor]  All right, so keep going with the Gabapenin. I will order the imaging of your neck and the shot will hopefully help some with those symptoms in your hand. And then we'll follow up afterwards.\n[patient]  Alright, is the MRI today?\n[doctor]  Um, you probably can't do it today, but let me talk with Roy and see how soon we can get it done. Just give me a quick minute, and then Roy will come in and get things scheduled as soon as we can.\n[patient]  All right.\n[doctor]  Alright, well it was nice meeting you my friend.\n[patient]  You as well.

He's a 61-year-old male who presents today for a routine follow-up with chronic medical conditions.\n[doctor]  Of note, the patient underwent an aortic valve replacement and ascending aortic aneurysm repair on January 22nd, 2013. Regarding his blood work from April 10th, 2021, the patient's alkaline phosphatase, excuse me, was elevated to 156. His lipid panel showed elevated total cholesterol of 247, HDL of 66, LDL of 166, and triglycerides at 74. The patient's TSH was normal at 2.68. His CBC was unremarkable. His most recent vitamin D level was at the high end of normal at 94.\n[doctor]  Good morning, Mr. Walker. How are you doing? I mean, it's been a crazy year.\n[patient]  I'm doing fine for the most part, but there are a few things I want to cover today.\n[doctor]  Sure. Go right ahead.\n[patient]  Uh, well, I'm having more fatigue, but I don't know if it's age or if it's just, you know, drained at the end of the day. But I still ride my bike. I can't go as fast as I used to. I'm still riding and, you know, after a long bike ride, I'll sit down and then boom. I'm out, you know.\n[doctor]  Yeah, what's along by cried to you?\n[patient]  20 to 30 miles.\n[doctor]  20 to 30 miles on a road bike.\n[patient]  Yeah, a road bike. I think it's a time thing. If I had more time, I would try to do my 40 miles, but I haven't done that. Obviously, we're too early in the season, so my typical ride is like 2030. In years back, I could do 40 on a good day. I can still do 20, but you know, I'm tired and have to take a break when I get home.\n[doctor]  Yeah, I understand.\n[patient]  and Tyler's my buddy. He's always nice and waits for me, but I used to be able to beat him. But now he waits for me all the time. He's older than me, and it, it kills me.\n[doctor]  Yeah, I can imagine that would upset me too.\n[patient]  Well, the last time, you know, you found a hard thing then, just making sure that the valve is holding out, you know?\n[doctor]  Right. So, when was your last stress test?\n[patient]  It was September 9th, 2019 because I'm eight years out from surgery and back then they said, you know, it's going to last eight years. And I'm at that year. So I just want to make sure. I asked Dr. Lewis for an echocardiogram to see how I'm doing.\n[doctor]  Yeah.\n[patient]  But it's not like nothing has changed drastically since I saw you.\n[doctor]  Okay good. Do you still go down the Hopkins at all?\n[patient]  No, not at all. I just get follow-ups intermittently here. Going there is just, it's too much stress.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  One more thing, I want to make sure I don't forget. My wife and friends tell me that when I walk, I purse my lips when I'm breathing. Other doctors have said, did you notice your purse lips breathing? I don't know if that's a bad habit or what.\n[doctor]  Okay. Is there any weising associated with that?\n[patient]  No, no wheezing.\n[doctor]  And you're able to bike 30 miles and mostly keep up with your friend, Tyler correct?\n[patient]  Yeah, the only other thing I want to mention is it's not like I do routine testicular exams, but I know I have this little nodule on my right testicle.\n[doctor]  on the testicle or the epididimus.\n[patient]  Epididimus. I really don't know. I'm not super concerned. I read a little online. Just wanted to ask you.\n[doctor]  And did you have a vestectomy?\n[patient]  No, let me pull my notes out and make sure I'm mentioned everything I wanted to tell you. Those are the only things and it's not like my tiredness is depression or anything. I'm a pretty happy guy overall, you know? I just know you would ask those questions.\n[doctor]  What time are you going to sleep and about how many hours do you sleep at night?\n[patient]  It varies. Usually I get six to seven hours of sleep. I get out of bed some days to be at work by seven o'clock lecture and I try to work out in the morning. I don't. I'm not. I'm not always successful. And now what I do is I do make reservations twice a week for five forty five swim in the morning.\n[doctor]  Okay, so you're getting 6-7 hours of sleep, and has your wife ever mentioned if you snore or stop breathing at any time?\n[patient]  I believe I snore a little bit, but she's never said anything about me not breathing.\n[doctor]  Okay. So you're currently taking vitamin D3, around 5,000 units on Sundays and 2,000 or 50,000 units on Sundays. Excuse me and 2,000 on the other six days. And then, clindamycin prior to dental procedures, correct?\n[patient]  Yeah, that's right.\n[doctor]  Have you had a COVID-19 shot yet?\n[patient]  I receive both. My first dose on January 15th, 21th, and my second on February 5th, 21.\n[doctor]  Good. If you'd hop up here on the table, we're just going to do a physical exam.\n[doctor]  Well, Mr. Walker, overall you're doing well. I'm going to order an echocardiogram and a stress test. I also recommend that you follow up with cardiology. I think Dr. Vincent Sanchez would be a great fit for you.\n[patient]  All right.\n[doctor]  Also, your recent labs showed an elevated alkaline phosphatase level at 156. Now this could be related to your liver, but most likely related to your bone health. We're going to check a few labs today.\n[patient]  You're gonna have them done today?\n[doctor]  Yes, sir, and we will send the results through your patient portal unless something is way off, then we'll give you a call.\n[patient]  Sound good.\n[doctor]  Now as far as your breathing, I observed the per-slip breathing and your exhalation is low. I think you should do a pulmonary function test to further evaluate, and I'll order that as well.\n[doctor]  Now the nodule in your right testicle should be evaluated by urology, and we will place that referral today, also.\n[patient]  Sounds like I'm going to be busy getting this all checked out.\n[doctor]  Yes, sir. Now you are due for your MMR and I recommend you get the shingles vaccine as well. You have completed your COVID-19 so that's good.\n[doctor]  Now I'm going to have you return in about a year for your wellness visit. We'll see you back sooner if needed after I review all those labs and those other studies.\n[doctor]  Do you have any other questions for me?\n[patient]  No, Doc. I think you covered it all.\n[doctor]  Great. Okay, the nurse will be back in a minute to give you MMR today and the front desk will line up a time to do the shingles vaccine next month.\n[patient]  Thanks, Doc. Have a great day.\n[doctor]  All right, I use my general physical exam template for respiratory notate. Perse lip breathing, low exhalation phase, clear to oscillation, no weizing. Genitalia notate. Right, testicle with 2 to 3 millimeters palpable nodule does not feel as if it will, does not feel as if with the epididimus or variococel, left testicle normal, no hernia. All other portions of the physical exam are normal default.\n[doctor]  Assessment history of the aortic aneurysm repair, the patient underwent an aortic valve replacement, and ascending aortic aneurysm repair on January 20, 2013. He is doing well overall and currently asymptomatic. He is currently not seen by cardiology routinely, suggest the following up and suggest Vincent Sanchez as his physician. We will perform an echocardiogram, a-slash stress test.\n[doctor]  Elevated alkaline phosphatase level. Most recent CMD showed elevation at 156. This could be related to his liver, but most likely re-related to his bone health. I've ordered an alkaline phosphatase and again a GT.\n[doctor]  Lung field abnormal finding on exonia, excuse me, on examination. The patient has been noted to purse his lips while breathing. He was found himself. He has found himself feeling more fatigued at the end of the day. He does bicycle around 20 to 30 miles at a time. His exhal, exhalation phase is low on exam, and I've ordered PFTs today to further, for further evaluation.\n[doctor]  The right testicular nodule is about 2 to 3 millimeters. I've noted on the exam. There's no hernia palpable, and I have suggested reaching out to Auro, urology for a possible ultrasound.\n[doctor]  Preventative health, the most recent blood work was reviewed with no significant abnormal areas, abnormalities other than the CMV. Uh, we will perform MMR tighter today. I have suggested the shingles vaccine, and he is fully vaccinated against COVID-19.\n[doctor]  Patient or return for a follow-up in one year for a wellness visit sooner if needed. He is to call with any questions or concerns.",

            "src": "[doctor]  Patrick Allen, date of birth July 7, 1977. New patient visit. Past medical history includes GERD anxiety depression. Here for chronic abdominal pain. He had an abdominal CT on January 23, 2020. Impression is a normal CT of the UB abdomen.\n[doctor]  Hello, are you Mr. Allen?\n[patient]  Yes, I am.\n[doctor]  Hi, my name is Dr. Edwards. Nice to meet you.\n[patient]  Nice to meet you.\n[doctor]  Welcome to the GI Specialty Clinic.\n[patient]  Thank you.\n[doctor]  Did you have any problems finding us?\n[patient]  No, I've been here with my sister once before.\n[doctor]  Good. So how can I help you today? Uh, the referral I have is for abdominal pain and diarrhea.\n[patient]  Right? So, I've had, I've been having this pain right here in my stomach like right around here.\n[doctor]  So in the area of your mid abdomen just below the belly button.\n[patient]  Correct. I've had the pain on and off for about two years. I finally went to the ER and a few months ago and they did a CT scan.\n[doctor]  I saw that.\n[patient]  Yeah, they said they didn't really see anything on the scan.\n[doctor]  Yes, I agree. It looked normal.\n[patient]  The problem is I'm either constipated or have explosive diarrhea.\n[doctor]  Is the pain there all the time?\n[patient]  It's a nagging feeling and it just depends. Sometimes it bothers me, sometimes it doesn't.\n[doctor]  Has this been the case over the past two years as well?\n[patient]  More recently in the past couple months, at least with the constipation and diarrhea.\n[doctor]  And before that, how are your bowel movements?\n[patient]  They were normal.\n[doctor]  Okay, so any blood in your stool?\n[patient]  Nope.\n[doctor]  Do you feel like you have more constipation or diarrhea?\n[patient]  Probably more constipation.\n[doctor]  Okay, so when you're constipated, do you not have a bowel movement or is the stool hard?\n[patient]  I usually don't go, but when I do, it's hard.\n[doctor]  And how often do you have a bowel movement when you're constipated?\n[patient]  about three to four times a week. It's like when I need to go to the bathroom, if I can massage it, it feels like it's moving some and I can eventually go.\n[doctor]  Okay. And when you have a bowel movement, does the pain change?\n[patient]  Yeah, it gets a little better.\n[doctor]  And are you eating and drinking okay? Any nausea or vomiting, heartburn or indigestion?\n[patient]  None of that.\n[doctor]  Okay, so tell me about the diarrhea. How often do you get it?\n[patient]  It kind of just depends on what I eat. I think I have a very sensitive stomach. If I eat pasta with a creamy sauce, I'm probably gonna have diarrhea.\n[doctor]  Okay, and it doesn't happen for multiple days in a row or is it just one time?\n[patient]  It's usually just one time and then it's over.\n[doctor]  And how's your weight been? Any fluctuation?\n[patient]  Nice and pretty stable, although I could stand to lose about 25 pounds.\n[doctor]  Okay, and is there any family history of GI issues that you know of?\n[patient]  not that I can think of. Well, actually my sister does have problems with her stomach too. She has irritable bowel syndrome and that is kind of what I always thought. I had even thought I've never been diagnosed with it.\n[doctor]  Okay. And is there any family history of GI cancer or liver disease?\n[patient]  Nope.\n[doctor]  Have you ever had any surgeries on your abdomen?\n[patient]  I've never had any surgery.\n[doctor]  Okay, so your gallbladder, appendix, all those are still intact?\n[patient]  Yep.\n[doctor]  and have you ever had a colonoscopy?\n[patient]  No, I thought that happened when you turned 50.\n[doctor]  Well, that's for colon cancer screening, but there are other reasons to have a colonoscopy, like unexplained abdominal pain and changes in bowel habits.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Well, come have a seat here and lay back so I can examine you.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  I'm going to start by listening to your belly with my stethoscope. And I hear vowel sounds in all four quadrants.\n[patient]  What does that mean? Is everything okay?\n[doctor]  It just means that I can hear little noises in all areas of your belly, which means your bowels are active and working.\n[patient]  Okay, good.\n[doctor]  So now, I'm going to push on your upper and lower abdomen. Let me know if you have any pain.\n[patient]  It hurts a little when you push right there on the left side near my belly button.\n[doctor]  Okay. I do feel stool in your lower colon, which would coincide with constipation, but I also feel a slight enlargement of your liver here on the upper right side. Have you had any lab work done recently?\n[patient]  Yes, I have a physical about four months ago and I had blood drawn then.\n[doctor]  Okay, and did your primary care physicians say anything about the lab results?\n[patient]  He said I had some very slightly elevated liver enzymes, but we would recheck them in about six months.\n[doctor]  And you remember what enzymes were elevated, ALT, AST, ALP?\n[patient]  He said the all and the AST were elevated.\n[doctor]  And do you take any medications, either prescription or over the counter?\n[patient]  I take Crestor and Olma Sarton Daily and then Tylenol for Occasional Paying.\n[doctor]  And how frequently do you take the Tylenol?\n[patient]  Hardly ever, maybe once a month.\n[doctor]  And, do you consume alcohol?\n[patient]  Uh, yes, but only a couple of beers after working in the yard on Saturdays.\n[doctor]  Okay, and no previous history of heavy alcohol or drug use.\n[patient]  Nope.\n[doctor]  And have you had any recent issues with excessive bruising or bleeding?\n[patient]  Nope.\n[doctor]  And how about any issues with your ankles or feet swelling?\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  Okay, I'm gonna take a look at your eyes and skin. I don't see any jaundice.\n[patient]  What would cause that?\n[doctor]  Issues with your liver. Let me take a quick listen to your heart and lungs.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Lungs are clear, bilateral heart sounds are normal, no murmurs, gallops, or rubs noted.\n[patient]  That's good.\n[doctor]  Yes. The rest of your physical exam is normal other than what seems to be an increased stool burden in your colon and a slight hepatomegaly.\n[patient]  What's that?\n[doctor]  Increased stool burden means that there's a lot of stool sitting in your colon.\n[patient]  And that's the constipation, right? But what about the other thing?\n[doctor]  The hepatomegally means the liver is enlarged.\n[patient]  But you said mine was slightly enlarged.\n[doctor]  Correct.\n[patient]  So what does that mean?\n[doctor]  Well, let's talk about what we found, and then some possible next steps if you're in agreement.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  So, as I said, the heptomegally means your liver is enlarged.\n[patient]  Could that be why my stomach is hurting and I'm having issues with the constipation and diarrhea?\n[doctor]  No, I think you're constipated and have occasional bouts of diarrhea because of certain foods you eat. And we can get you started right away on a fiber supplement that should help with that.\n[patient]  So what about my liver? Why is it enlarged?\n[doctor]  Well, there are many reasons why people can have an elevated liver enzymes and also enlarged liver. Some possible causes are certain medications that can be toxic to liver, alcohol abuse, fatty liver disease, hepatitis, cirrhosis, and other liver diseases like Wilson's disease.\n[patient]  So what I need to do.\n[doctor]  Well, I think since it's been about four months since your blood work was done, we should check your liver enzymes in addition to a few other labs.\n[patient]  Okay, and then what?\n[doctor]  We will get those drawn today and then depending upon the results you may need an ultrasound of your liver. I think we need to talk about your medications too.\n[patient]  which medications?\n[doctor]  Crestor, how long have you been taking that?\n[patient]  about 18 months.\n[doctor]  Okay. Well, Crestor is one of the medications that can cause liver toxicity so it may be a good idea to discuss other alternatives.\n[patient]  Should I talk to my primary care, or can you change it?\n[doctor]  I would recommend calling your primary care and discuss that with him since he follows you for your blood pressure and cholesterol.\n[patient]  Okay, I'll call in this afternoon.\n[doctor]  Great! I also think we should go ahead and get you scheduled for a liver ultrasound. If your blood work looks good, then we can always cancel that.\n[patient]  Okay, when you think I'll be able to get the ultrasound done.\n[doctor]  Hopefully, within the next two weeks, you will receive a call from the radiology scheduling this afternoon to get it set up.\n[patient]  Okay, and then what happens?\n[doctor]  When I get the results from the test, I will contact you. And depending upon what we find, we'll come up with our next steps.\n[patient]  And what should I see you again?\n[doctor]  Let's schedule an appointment when you check out to return in four weeks. We'll discuss how you're doing with the Fiber Supplement and your constipation and review test results to determine if we need to do further testing on your liver.\n[patient]  Okay, is there anything else I can do to help with these issues?\n[doctor]  Definitely refrain from drinking any alcohol, increase your water intake to at least 48 ounces a day in addition to taking the fiber supplement to help with your constipation. And be mindful of eating foods that you were sensitive to so you can avoid the bouts of diarrhea.\n[patient]  Okay, and I'll talk to my primary care about my crestor.\n[doctor]  Excellent. And do you have any other questions for me?\n[patient]  I don't think so.\n[doctor]  Great! So remember when you check out the front desk, schedule follow-up appointment with me for four weeks, and then go to the lab to get your blood work drawn.\n[patient]  Okay, sounds good.\n[doctor]  and expect a call from Radiology Scheduling about setting up your ultrasound.\n[patient]  Alright, thanks, Dr. Edwards.\n[doctor]  Thank you, Mr. Allen.",

The pain is localized just inferior to the umbilicus and he describes it as a \u201cnagging feeling\u201d when it is present. The pain sometimes improves following a bowel movement. Unfortunately, Mr. Allen reports that the pain has been present more often in the past 2 months. In 01/2020, the patient presented to the emergency room due to the pain and underwent a CT scan.\n\nIn addition to the abdominal pain, Mr. Allen complains of constipation and episodic severe diarrhea for the past 2 months; however, he estimates that the constipation is more frequent than the diarrhea. When he is constipated, he has a bowel movement 3-4 times a week and the stools are hard. Regarding his diarrhea, he has noticed that it seems to be associated with certain foods. In particular, he notes that pasta with a creamy sauce is likely to prompt an episode of diarrhea. When this occurs, he usually has just 1 bowel movement of diarrhea and then it resolves. The patient states that, prior to 2 months ago, his bowel movements were normal. Mr. Allen notes that massaging his abdomen has sometimes been helpful in producing a bowel movement.\n\nThe patient\u2019s last physical was 4 months ago, and he confirms that he did have bloodwork that day. Mr. Allen reports that his primary care provider notified him that his AST and ALT were mildly elevated and advised that they would need to recheck his liver enzymes in 6 months. The patient\u2019s medication list includes Crestor and olmesartan daily and he estimates that he has been taking the Crestor for approximately 18 months. He also takes Tylenol as needed for pain, approximately once a month. The patient states that he drinks 2 beers once a week and denies a history of heavy alcohol or drug use. He also denies excessive bruising or bleeding and any lower extremity edema.\n\nThe patient denies blood in his stools, nausea, vomiting, heartburn, and indigestion. He confirms that he is eating and drinking normally, and his weight has been stable. He does acknowledge that he would like to lose 25 pounds, however. He has no family history of gastrointestinal cancer or liver disease; however, his sister has irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The patient has not had any prior abdominal surgeries and he has never had a colonoscopy.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nRespiratory\nLungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.\n\nCardiovascular\nNo murmurs, gallops, or rubs.\n\nAbdomen\nNormoactive bowel sounds in all 4 quadrants.

The most likely etiology of his abdominal pain is constipation given his history, exam with increased stool burden, and normal abdominal CT. Mild hepatomegaly was also noted on exam today and the patient reportedly had elevated liver enzymes on labs with his primary care provider 4 months ago. The patient is currently on Crestor which may be contributing to his elevated liver enzymes.

She biopsied a 0.7-millimeter lesion, which was located on right inferior back. Pathology came back as melanoma.\n[doctor]  Mrs. Jackson, it's good to meet you.\n[patient]  Likewise, we should wear under better circumstances.\n[doctor]  Yeah, I hear your dermatologist sent you to me because she found a melanoma.\n[patient]  Yes, that's what the biopsy said.\n[doctor]  Okay, and when did you first notice the spot?\n[patient]  My mom noticed it when I was visiting her last month.\n[doctor]  I see. And so you went to the dermatologist on April 10th to get a checked out, right?\n[patient]  Yes, I wanted to be extra cautious because skin cancer does run in my family.\n[doctor]  Well, I'm really glad you took it seriously and got a check. Who in your family has had skin cancer? And do you know if it was melanoma or was it basal cell or squamous cell?\n[patient]  My mom and her sister, I think they both had melanoma.\n[doctor]  Okay. Do you have any other types of cancer in the family like breast or ovarian?\n[patient]  My grandfather had pancreatic cancer.\n[doctor]  Okay, and was that your mom or dad's father?\n[patient]  Mothers.\n[doctor]  Okay, and have you personally had any skin spots in the past that you got checked out and they were cancerous or precancerous?\n[patient]  No, this was the first time I've been to a dermatologist. But my primary care doctor looks over all of my moles every year and my physical and hasn't said he's concerned about any of them before.\n[doctor]  Good good. Uh, let's go over your medical history from your chart. I have that you're not taking any medications and don't have any health problems listed, but that you're allergic to augmentin. Is that right?\n[patient]  Yes, that's correct.\n[doctor]  Okay, and for social history, can you tell me what you do for work?\n[patient]  I own an auto repair shop.\n[doctor]  Okay, and have you ever been a smoker?\n[patient]  Yeah, I still smoke from time to time. I started that awful habit in my teens, and it's hard to break, but I'm trying.\n[doctor]  I'm glad you're trying to quit. Uh... What about your surgical history? Have you had any surgeries?\n[patient]  I had gall bladder and appendix.\n[doctor]  Okay, great. We can get your chart up to date now. Thank you. And other than the melanoma, how has your health been any unintentional weight changes, headaches, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, vision changes?\n[patient]  No, I've been feeling great.\n[doctor]  Good. Well, let me take a look at your back here where they did the biopsy if you don't mind.\n[patient]  Sure.\n[doctor]  Okay, I'm going to describe it in medical jargon what I'm seeing here so that the recording can capture it, but you and I are going to go over it together in just a moment, okay?\n[patient]  Okay, that's fine.\n[doctor]  All right, so on the right inferior back there's a 1 cm shave biopsy sight, including all of the dermis with no residual pigmentation. There's no intrinsic or satellite lesions, no other suspicious moles, no axillary, cervical, or superclivicular lymphedentepathy. There is a soft lymph node in the right groin, but it's not tender, otherwise normal exam.\n[doctor]  Okay, you can sit up. So what I was saying there is that I see your biopsy site, but I don't see any other us skin lumps or bumps that look suspicious. I also felt your lymph nodes to see if any of them felt abnormal. There is one in the right groin that felt slightly abnormal. It's very likely nothing, but I do want you to have an ultrasound of that area to confirm it's nothing. And you know, make sure it's nothing that we need to worry about. The reason we're being extra cautious is that melanoma can very rarely metastasize to the lymph nodes. The ultrasound can tell us if we need to look into this further.\n[patient]  Okay, I shouldn't worry too much then.\n[doctor]  No, I have a low suspicion that it will show anything.\n[patient]  Okay, good.\n[doctor]  So assuming that the ultrasound is normal, the treatment for emelonoma is to cut out the area where the lesion was, with lesions that are 0.7 millimeters or less, and that's what we recommend, and yours was exactly 0.7 millimeters. If it were any bigger, we would have had to do a more complex surgery. But what I recommend for you is what we call a wide local incision, excuse me, excision, meaning that I will make a long incision, and then cut out an area a bit wider than your current biopsy site. The incision is long, because that's what allows me to close the skin nicely. You'll have a fairly long scar from the incision.\n[patient]  Okay, that is fine with me. I can't see back there anyways.\n[doctor]  Yeah, your wife can tell you what it looks like, and she may need to help care for the incision at it, as it heals. But since we're, we aren't doing the more complex surgery, I actually don't need to see you back unless you want to check in with me, or have any problems. However, it is very important that you continue to follow up with your dermatologist regularly, so she can monitor you. Your dermatologist will check that this one doesn't come back, but she'll also check for other lesions that look suspicious. Unfortunately, since you've had one melanoma, you're at a higher risk of developing another one somewhere else.\n[patient]  Yeah, she did say she wanted to see me back.\n[doctor]  Good, and I'm sure she's already told you, but it's very important that you apply sunscreen anytime and anywhere that your skin is exposed to sunlight.\n[patient]  Yeah, she definitely went over that several times with me.\n[doctor]  Good. Other than that, I think that's all for me. Um, we'll get you set up for the ultrasound, the procedure. Do you have any questions for me?\n[patient]  Um, no, I can't think of any at this time.\n[doctor]  Okay, my nurse will be in to get you scheduled, so sit tight. It was very good to meet you.\n[patient]  Thank you.

            "src": "[doctor]  Donna Torres, date of birth, August 1, 1980.\n[doctor]  Hi Donna, how are you?\n[patient]  I'm good. How about you?\n[doctor]  I'm doing well. Thank you. And so, I saw that Dr. Brown put you on Busper. Have you been on that before?\n[patient]  No, that's new.\n[doctor]  Okay. How is it working for you?\n[patient]  My anxiety is going good now. Thankfully, I'm serious. It was brutal in November and December. Finally, I was like, I cannot do this. I have no idea why happened. Dr. Ward did put me on singular and she did say we need to be careful because singular can cause anxiety. So I'm not sure if that was the issue or what.\n[doctor]  **** Okay\n[patient]  and it would start usually during the day at work.\n[doctor]  I see.\n[patient]  I mean, I'm fine now.\n[doctor]  Well, that's good. That things have settled. I do wonder if some of what you were dealing with is hormonal, and that's why I was asking. Because you were on the progesterone, and I feel like you were having some irritability back then too.\n[patient]  I did.\n[doctor]  And that was before we started the progesterone.\n[patient]  Yes.\n[doctor]  So, I know we started it for regulating your periods, but perhaps it helped with this also.\n[patient]  Yeah, and before in November and December, I noticed that the week before my period, my anxiety would go through the roof. Which then, I knew my period was coming. They'd turn into my anxiety, spiking, just at random times.\n[doctor]  I'm okay.\n[patient]  and it seemed like it was for no reason.\n[doctor]  but November and December you were on the progesterone at that time.\n[patient]  Yes.\n[doctor]  Alright, so not really a link there, alright.\n[patient]  Yeah, I don't know.\n[doctor]  Yeah, I don't know either. Sometimes with the aging process, that can happen too.\n[patient]  I figured maybe that's what it was.\n[doctor]  And we did go through the Gallev in November and December so that can be pretty stressful also.\n[patient]  Yeah, and at work, that's when I first started to lead the process of delivering the results to patients with COVID. In the beginning of the whole pandemic, patients would have to wait nine days before they'd get their results. And then we opened the evaluation centers and the COVID clinic. So I think it just took a toll on me.\n[doctor]  Yeah, I can absolutely see that.\n[patient]  Yeah, and then I was feeling selfish because I wasn't even on the front lines. I mean, I was supporting people, sure, but I wasn't in the ICU. So I felt selfish and guilty. I mean, hands down the physicians and nurses were in the thick of it, and there I was having anxiety. And it felt ridiculous.\n[doctor]  Well, honestly, you feel how you feel and what you were doing wasn't easy as well. So, but let's see. I need to just put the stacks back to work. All right, so no other issues whatsoever?\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  Have you lost weight?\n[patient]  No, but I stopped taking the Camilla Burf control. My hunger level was a new high. I mean, I was eating constantly. I felt like, what is going on?\n[doctor]  Alright.\n[patient]  And now I'm feeling better.\n[doctor]  Okay, that's good. And your masked face, though. It just looks thinner.\n[patient]  Well, the past six months, I have lost some weight.\n[doctor]  Okay, good. Anything else going on?\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  All right, so your PAP was in 2019. I don't think that we need to repeat that because it was negative slash negative. Um, have you ever had an abnormal PAP?\n[patient]  Not with you, but I did around 2009 and then I had to be seen every six months for a while. And then I had a normal pap.\n[doctor]  Alright, well let's just repeat it then.\n[patient]  Yeah, that's fine with me, to be safe.\n[doctor]  Okay, I know it sounds superstitious, but I feel like with all the immunocompromising, the pressure, the stress that people's bodies have been under, and the potential for getting COVID or the vaccine, I have actually seen some, um, an increase in abnormal paths in people who have been fine for a while. So that's why I figure let's just check.\n[patient]  Okay, I fight the vaccine fight every day at home because my husband isn't ready to get it. Same with my daughter. She shares the same worries as her dad and how it'll impact her when she gets older.\n[doctor]  Have you had the vaccine?\n[patient]  Yes, I have. And so has my son. He has had his first already.\n[doctor]  Okay. Well, you know, you can only do what you can do.\n[patient]  Yeah, I agree.\n[doctor]  All right, well, let's complete your exam.\n[patient]  All right.\n[doctor]  So, let's take a deep breath. And again, all right, you can breathe normally. All right, and take one more deep breath. Okay, now I'm going to touch your neck. Go ahead and swallow. Perfect. And just place your hand above your head. Okay, I do feel some little bumps.\n[patient]  Yeah, but they're not as big as they were.\n[doctor]  Okay, in this breast it does feel a little bit denser. Does it hurt at all?\n[patient]  It does where your left hand just was.\n[doctor]  Okay, right here?\n[patient]  Yeah, down here. But whenever I breastfed, it was always sore there too. I had a clog and something else. The lumps do feel smaller, but they are still there, unfortunately.\n[doctor]  Yeah, they are. Uh, well now I don't know because if it was the progesterone, they would have gone away.\n[patient]  Yeah.\n[doctor]  Alright, well just let your knees just up, relax and open. How's the itching or discomfort? Are you still using the cream?\n[patient]  Yes, and I actually need to get that refill for the first time ever.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  But yeah, I use it once a week and it does help.\n[doctor]  Okay great. Alright looks good.\n[patient]  Good.\n[doctor]  You can go ahead and sit up.\n[patient]  Thank you.\n[doctor]  All right, so typically the lumps would often just shrink up pretty quickly after you've had one or two cycles, and you've had two cycles so far. So I think let's just keep monitoring them for now.\n[patient]  Okay, and what could that mean?\n[doctor]  Well, so just like people have an increased risk of breast cancer, there's also an increased risk for breast issues. You know what I mean? So for example, cysts and lumps and fibroadenomas, those are all benign things. They're annoying and require some workup, but they're all benign.\n[patient]  And I'm just worried because I'm almost 40 and my mom was almost 45 when she was diagnosed with breast cancer. So I mean, I know there's nothing I can do about it, but it just I feel like we had it under control and now it isn't.\n[doctor]  Well, I wouldn't say that. I mean, I feel like we're at a point where we have a good cadence for you having surveillance on things. And I think you are more aware of your breasts than ever before, and things actually haven't changed.\n[patient]  Yeah.\n[doctor]  So those are all good things.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  because if it was cancer, we'd actually, we would see some change.\n[patient]  We would. Okay. Thank you for explaining that.\n[doctor]  Yeah, so I know it's annoying and distressing, but I think that's where we're at. It's annoying that you have the breast issue, and it's annoying that we have to follow them.\n[patient]  Yeah, I agree there.\n[doctor]  But the only extra that I could potentially do is we could get a breast specialist on the team and have you start to follow with them. And one of the advantages there is that they sometimes will do an ultrasound as an extension of their physical exam in the office to check out it, check it out on their own. They also have a lot more experience and more willingness to sometimes perform procedures earlier if they think it needs, if they think it needs to be done. And I think they tend to be much quicker than, you know, like radiology, as to biopsy it.\n[patient]  Okay, I'll do whatever you think I should.\n[doctor]  All right. Well, I think since you're feeling worried, let's go ahead and we can get them on board. I'll send out a referral and they will call you within the next couple of business days to schedule.\n[patient]  Okay, I think that sounds great.\n[doctor]  All right, I do too. All right, well any questions or anything else we can discuss today.\n[patient]  No, I think I'm all set.\n[doctor]  All right, good. All right. We'll have a good rest of your day and just give us a call if you need anything else.\n[patient]  Alright, thank you. You have a good day too.\n[doctor]  Alright.",

It's lovely to meet you.\n[patient]  You as well.\n[doctor]  So, you've come to see me today because you had a right breast lump peck to me last year. Is that right?\n[patient]  Yes, on January 20th, 2020.\n[doctor]  Okay, and how have you been since then? Any problems or concerns?\n[patient]  No, I'm feeling good. I do my self-brest exams religiously now and haven't felt anything since.\n[doctor]  Perfect. I want to back up and go over your history, so I can make sure everything in your chart is correct and I don't miss anything. So I'll tell you what we have in your chart from your other providers and you tell me if anything is wrong or missing. Sound good?\n[patient]  Sound good.\n[doctor]  Great! So, I have that you were found to have a calcification in your right breast during a mammogram in October 2019. Was that just a normal screening mammogram or was it done because you fell to lump?\n[patient]  It was just a normal one you're supposed to get every so often.\n[doctor]  I see. And then it looks like you had an ultrasound of your right breast on November 3rd, 2019, which revealed a mass at the 2 o'clock position 11 centimeters from the nipple in the retroireolar region. The report states the mass was 0.4 by 2 by 3 centimeters.\n[patient]  Yes, that sounds right. Hard to remember now, though.\n[doctor]  Yep, definitely.\n[doctor]  Based on those results, they decided to do an ultrasound guided core needle biopsy on December 5th, 2019. Pathology results during that biopsy came back as grade 2 are positive, PR positive, DCIS, or Dr. Carcinoma in situ.\n[patient]  Yes, unfortunately.\n[doctor]  I know. Scary stuff. But you have a lumpectomy on January 20, 2020, which removed the 8mm tumor and margins were negative. The pathology confirmed DCIS. Looks like they also removed 5 lymph nodes, which thankfully were negative from a lignancy. That's great.\n[patient]  Yeah, I was definitely very relieved.\n[doctor]  And your last mammogram was in January 2021, and that was normal.\n[patient]  Yes.\n[doctor]  Okay, so I feel like I have a good grasp of what's been going on with you now. And you're here today to establish care with me, so I can continue to follow you and make sure you're doing well, right?\n[patient]  Yes, fingers crossed.\n[doctor]  Definitely. We'll keep a close eye on you, and take good care of you.\n[patient]  Okay, sounds good.\n[doctor]  I have a few more questions for you. When was your last colonoscopy?\n[patient]  I had one in 2018 and if I remember correctly, I had one polyp and that was removed and it wasn't cancerous.\n[doctor]  Okay, yes, I see that report now. One polyp in the sigmoid colon which had a benign tubular adenoma. Okay, and when was your last menstrual period?\n[patient]  Gosh, it was probably around 30 years ago.\n[doctor]  Okay. Do you have children?\n[patient]  I do. I have five.\n[doctor]  A big family then. That's nice.\n[patient]  Yes, and they're all having kids of their own now, so it's getting even bigger.\n[doctor]  I bet. Sounds like fun.\n[patient]  It is.\n[doctor]  Did you have any other pregnancies that were miscarriages or terminations?\n[patient]  Really, I did not.\n[doctor]  Okay, so for the record, that's G5P5. And now that your postman apposal, are you currently, or have you ever been on hormone replacement therapy?\n[patient]  My primary care doctor gave me the option years ago, but I decided against it.\n[doctor]  Okay, and on your review systems form, you indicated that you've not had any recent weight loss or gain, headaches, bone pain, urinary symptoms, or blood in the stools. But you did indicate that you have some back pain, joint pain, and high cholesterol. Tell me some more about those.\n[patient]  Okay, so I've seen doctors for all of those. They've said, excuse me, the back and knee pain are age-related. And the cholesterol is a fairly new diagnosis, but I'm working on exercise and cutting back on fatty foods to see if I can get it lower without any medication.\n[doctor]  Okay, and your primary care doctor is following you for that, right?\n[patient]  That's correct.\n[doctor]  Okay, for medications, I have that you take Coke 10, vitamin D, vitamin C, fish oil, and elderberry fruit. Is that alright?\n[patient]  Yes, and that's all.\n[doctor]  Okay, so for your medical history, it's high cholesterol and stage zero, R-slash, PR, positive invasive ductal carcinoma of the right breast. Any surgeries other than the lumpectomy?\n[patient]  I did have my tubes tied after my last baby, but that's all.\n[doctor]  Okay. And how about family history?\n[patient]  My mom had non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and my dad had prostate cancer and heart disease, but I think that's it.\n[doctor]  All right, any family history of breast cancer?\n[patient]  None.\n[doctor]  Did any of your children have medical issues or siblings with medical problems?\n[patient]  I do not have any siblings and, thankfully, my children are all healthy.\n[doctor]  Wonderful. Do you have any history of smoking, elicit drug use, heavy alcohol consumption?\n[patient]  No drugs. I do drink socially, but never more than that. And I used to smoke, but really everybody did back then, and I probably quit about 30 years ago.\n[doctor]  Excellent. I have that you're allergic to penicillin. Any other allergies?\n[patient]  Nope, just pen a sill in.\n[doctor]  Okay, I think that covers it. Hop up here and let me take a look at you.\n[doctor]  Okay, so let's use the normal new patient exam template. Only change to make is the breast exam. There are no palpable masses, however, there is skin thickening at the medial inferior aspect of the right breast, which may be radiation skin changes.\n[doctor]  In the results section, note that her ECOG performance status today is zero.\n[doctor]  Did you have radiation after the limpact to me?\n[patient]  I did. We also talked about endocrine therapy, but I decided against that.\n[doctor]  Okay, so your exam looks good, no masses, just some skin changes from that radiation. Now let's go over the plan for you.\n[patient]  Okay, sounds good.\n[doctor]  As you know, you've had DCIS, which will list in my note as stage zero, or slash PR positive, invasive ductal carcinoma of the right breast. Your status post-limpectomy with removal of five lymph nodes that were benign. You also had radiation therapy, but declined endocrine therapy. Today's clinical examination shows no evidence of recurrence with a DCIS or other malignancy and your mammogram in January. 2021 was also negative for recurrence and malignancy.\n[doctor]  So, based on all of that, we can just continue to observe you.\n[patient]  Okay, that sounds great. And where do I come back and see you?\n[doctor]  In a year, but you should have another mammogram in April of 2022 before you come back to see me.\n[patient]  Okay, I can do that.\n[doctor]  Wonderful. I'm glad to see you doing so well. Do you have any questions or concerns I can address for you today?\n[patient]  I don't think so.\n[doctor]  Okay, great.

Any pain here?\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  Okay, skin is intact, no midline tenderness to palpitation. Go ahead and lean back and lean to your right, to your left.

Not too bad?\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  Okay, range of motion is decreased in right hip with pain in the groin and internal and external rotation. Okay, go ahead and keep it up. Don't let me push it down. Does that hurt?\n[patient]  Right there.\n[doctor]  Okay, resisted right hip flexion causes pain in the right groin region. No tenderness is noted. Do you feel me touching you all the way down?\n[patient]  Yeah.\n[doctor]  Okay, motor control is normal in the lower extremities. Go ahead and lift your knee up.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Okay, lift it up.

So what I think we're dealing with is right hip to generative joint disease.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  And we do have some options. So first is to start some low impact exercises. I can provide you with a handout with what exercises you can do. You should take NSAIDS as needed to help with the pain and discomfort, as well as use of a cane to help offload the right side. A cane will help support your painful side to help reduce the pain.\n[patient]  Hmm, I don't love that idea, but I'll give it a try.\n[doctor]  Okay, that would be great. And we can also try a cordicone injection into the right hip joint to see if that offers any relief.\n[patient]  I would like to definitely get the injection.\n[doctor]  Okay, we can take care of that today while you're here, and then schedule a follow-up appointment in three months to see how you're doing, and then receive another injection if needed.\n[patient]  Okay, that sounds good.\n[doctor]  Okay, and here are the risks associated with getting the INIA injection. Please just take a moment to review it and consent to the shot.\n[patient]  I'm good.\n[doctor]  Great. We'll get that set up for you. All right. Well, I hope things feel better and we will see you back here in three months.\n[patient]  See you. Have a nice day.\n[doctor]  Thank you so much, you as well. Deep tendon reflex is one plus throughout. No focal motor weakness is noted. No focal sensory deficit noted. Can you please include the surgical list? Next radiographs, Mr. Arthur Graham of the right hip-done June 3rd, 2021 show high-grade condromalacia involving the intero-superior right acetabulum with sub-condromarodema and cyst formation.

So I'm glad you at least got outside. Sorry to hear you got hurt. Okay, so you're right. Needed you, did you feel it like pop or snap or anything when you heard it?\n[patient]  Yeah, I fell a little pop and then it swelled up really big afterward.\n[doctor]  Okay, did you try anything for the pain?\n[patient]  I took some ibuprofen and I put some ice on it.\n[doctor]  Okay did that help.\n[patient]  a little bit, but it's still really hard to get around.\n[doctor]  All right, and have you been able to stand on it or does that hurt too much?\n[patient]  It hurts quite a bit to stand, but I'm able to put weight on it.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right. And what part of the knee is it inside outside middle?\n[patient]  kind of that inside part of my kneecap.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right. And okay, so as long as you're here and then your primary care physician, I'm looking through your chart and it looks like we're treating your diabetes. So how you've been doing with your diet overall are you keeping your sugars low?\n[patient]  It's going okay. I forget to check quite a bit though.\n[doctor]  Sure.\n[patient]  on it.\n[doctor]  Yeah, I understand. How has your diet been lately?\n[patient]  It's been pretty good.\n[doctor]  Okay, okay good good you know it's hard to stay away from the sugary foods. Sometimes I I enjoy ice cream regularly. Okay, so let's do physical exam as long as you are here. So I'm just going to listen to your heart, your heart sounds normal no murmurs or gallops listen to your lungs quick. If you can take a deep breath lungs or clear that's good news, let's take a look at that knee right knee looks like it definitely has some swelling. I'm going to do some maneuvers. Here does it hurt when I push you on the inside of the knee.\n[patient]  Yeah, that hurts.\n[doctor]  Okay, how about the outside?\n[patient]  A little bit, but not as much.\n[doctor]  Okay, so some pain on palpation on the inside, a little bit of pain on the outside of the knee. If I bend the knee back, does that hurt?\n[patient]  Yeah.\n[doctor]  How about when I extend it?\n[patient]  Yeah, that hurts.\n[doctor]  Okay, so a little bit of limited range of motion, as well as pain on both flexion and extension on the knee. I'm going to push on this a little bit. Looks like your McMurray's test is negative, just checking for a meniscus tear. Okay, so let's talk a little bit about your plan. What I am concerned about for your knee is it sounds like you have a torn or injured MCLI. It's that inside tendon in your knee. So I'm concerned about that since you're having trouble with weight bearing and you heard that pop. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to put you in a straight leg brace and I'll prescribe some mowbic. You can start taking that as a pain reliever and to try to get some of the swelling down. I want you to ice your knee once an hour for about 15 minutes, but I'm also going to send you out for a MRI because we want to make sure this is what happens if there's any other damage to the knee. Does that sound good?\n[patient]  Yeah, that sounds great. Thank you.\n[doctor]  Yeah, and then for your diabetes, as long as you're here, it sounds like you're managing that pretty well. But I do want to get a recheck on your hemoglobin A1c. And then I'm also going to get a refill on the metformin that you have been taking 500 milligrams, so you can keep taking that as well. So, do you have any other questions for me?\n[patient]  No, that's a thanks.\n[doctor]  Alright, well, thank you. Hope that you feel better.",

So I looked here my appointment notes and I see that you're coming in you had some shoulder pain left shoulder pain for the last three weeks so.\n[doctor]  How you doing is it is it gotten any better?\n[patient]  Yeah, yeah. I've been having a lot of pain in my shoulder for the last three weeks now, and it's not getting better. Okay, do you remember what you were doing when the pain first started?\n[doctor]  So I was thinking that I can't recall like falling on it injuring it getting hit.\n[patient]  Hmm.\n[doctor]  I've been doing a lot of work in my basement and I even I put in a new ceiling. So I don't know if it's from all that activity doing that, but otherwise that's all I can think of.\n[patient]  Okay, so do you remember hitting it or anything like that?\n[doctor]  Know nothing at all.\n[patient]  Okay, all right, did you fall? Do you remember doing that?\n[doctor]  No.\n[patient]  Okay, I'm so like a little mystery. So have you had pain in that shoulder before?\n[doctor]  I mean, I'm very active so I can get pains in my shoulders, but it's nothing that sometimes some Tylenol can help.\n[patient]  Okay, and are you able to move the arm or is it kind of just stuck?\n[doctor]  I'm having a lot of pain like I can move it, but you know when I try to reach for something lifting anything. And even like I don't even try to put my hands over my head because it causes so much pain.\n[patient]  All right, so does that pain radiate anywhere or like where would you say it is in your shoulder?\n[doctor]  It actually it stays pretty much just right at the shoulder. It doesn't go down anywhere.\n[patient]  Okay, and the pain is it is it all the time or does it come and go?\n[doctor]  It's pretty much all the time, any time I put any pressure on it like when I'm trying to sleep at hertz even more so it's been affecting my sleep as well.\n[patient]  Okay, so I know you mentioned Tylenol, so this time I haven't taken anything for it.\n[doctor]  Yeah, I do the Tylenol, which usually works for me. And it does take the edge off, but I still have pain okay, did you try icing it at all?\n[patient]  I iced it initially, but I haven't iced it at all recently.\n[doctor]  Alright.\n[patient]  And so with your shoulder have you experienced any numbness in your arm or in your fingers.\n[doctor]  No numbness or tingling.\n[patient]  Okay, good. So I'm going to go ahead and do a quick physical exam and take a look at your shoulder. So I reviewed your vitals. Everything looks good with that so touch here in your shoulder. So your left shoulder exam, you have limited active and passive range of motion. So pressure here so that there is tenderness of the greater.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  To baracity of a humorous let's see, there is no tenderness at the sternoclavicular or acro.\n[doctor]  Yeah\n[patient]  Acromioclavicular joints.\n[doctor]  Yeah, yeah.\n[patient]  And looks like you have good hand grip. Let me see. So on the Neurovascular Exam of your left arm or capillary refill, is less than three seconds, and your sensation is as intact to light touch.\n[doctor]  Yes, thank you, Yap.\n[patient]  So you did get what we had to get an x-ray of your shoulder before you came in. And so it's normal. So that's really good. So there's no fractures, no bony abnormalities. So let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you. So you do have that left shoulder pain. So your symptoms are...\n[doctor]  most likely due to a rotator cuff tendonopathy. So this means that you injure tendon, you have injured tendons and muscles that make up your shoulder and make up your shoulder muscles. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to order an MRI of your left shoulder.\n[patient]  And so we're going to begin with that just to make sure nothing else is going on. Have you done physical therapy before?\n[doctor]  I haven't.\n[patient]  Okay, so what I'm going to do, I'm going to refer you to physical therapy for approximately six to eight weeks. And so they can help you strengthen those muscles around your shoulder, and that should definitely help with the pain during that time. You can also continue to take Tylenol. I don't think I need to prescribe anything else for the pain you said as it's working pretty good for you. So if your symptoms don't improve, we can consider steroid. Injection of your shoulder, which should provide some relief. But I think right now we can just go with the point and hopefully that works to alleviate your injury. So do you have any questions about the plan?\n[doctor]  So like I said, I'm really active. Do you think that this pain will ever go away?\n[patient]  Yeah, so many patients are very successful with rehab. And so we'll start with that and see how you do most most of the time. Once we build up those muscles around that shoulder, you know things, things, the pain, alleviates itself. And and you'll be good to go back to working on your basement and running and jogging and lifting weights, all all the active things people do these days.\n[doctor]  Okay, alright, thank you.\n[patient]  Bye.\n[doctor]  Okay, bye.",

Did you did you have some slips with that you said your ankles were swelling?\n[patient]  No, I do I like to like to eat.\n[doctor]  Are you eating a lot of salty foods and pizza or?\n[patient]  I like potato chips.\n[doctor]  Yeah\n[patient]  I like the salt and vinegar potato chips, they're really good so.\n[doctor]  Well, so do you go out to eat a lot or do you where you wear where are you eating those potato chips or is that just the home snacking or?\n[patient]  That's home-snacking. I buy that other the brand name salt and VINDITive because brand won't taste real good but that the brand name's really taste good.\n[doctor]  Oh\n[patient]  So I eat those probably every day.\n[doctor]  Goodness, while you know you we need to probably stop eating those now.\n[patient]  Yeah, well I hate to hate to give those up, but I guess I might have to.\n[doctor]  Well, since you've been in the hospital and they've helped you out with some with all that how are you feeling now?\n[patient]  While I'm doing better.\n[doctor]  They're melting, and they\u5c0d the voices out there.\n[patient]  I don't have quite as much shortness of breath. I think maybe getting up and walking a little more is helping.\n[doctor]  and they gave you a water pill and is that is that helping is that making you peel out.\n[patient]  Yeah, I have almost incontinence so.\n[doctor]  Goodness.\n[patient]  Yes, that's not very pleasant at all.\n[doctor]  And so they added another blood pressure medication. Also, how are you doing with that? Are you feeling a little bit better?\n[patient]  Yeah, I think so.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  If I can remember to take the pills.\n[doctor]  Yeah\n[patient]  That seems to be a sticky point.\n[doctor]  While IA pillbox or maybe setting an alarm on your phone might really help.\n[patient]  Okay, I'll give that a try anything that will help.\n[doctor]  Yeah, okay, well that's good to hear. So now have you bought a blood pressure cuff to have it home now?\n[patient]  Yes, I already had one, but I very failed if I ever used it.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  But\n[doctor]  Got it!\n[patient]  I'll try to use it every day now.\n[doctor]  Okay, and you might even just keep a log of what your blood pressures are. And when it's up think about you know what you've eaten if you've done something different because that may help you to figure out what you need to cut back on or how you might need to change your eating habits a little bit so.\n[patient]  Okay, okay.\n[doctor]  Have you been short of breath or any problem sleeping since you've been home?\n[patient]  No, I've been sleeping like a log.\n[doctor]  Okay, good. Alright, have you had any chest pain?\n[patient]  No note chest pain.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right. Well, let's do a quick physical exam here. So your vital signs, your blood pressure looks pretty good today at 128 over 70 to your temperature is 98. 7 and your heart rate is 72. Your respirations are 18. Your oxygen saturation looks pretty good at 96% okay. Now on your neck exam, there is no jugular venous distension on your heart exam. I appreciate a 2 over 6 systolic ejection murmur, which I've heard before. And so it's stable and your lungs are clear bilaterally and your lower extremities show just trace a demon. Now, now we since we did the echo cardiogram. I reviewed those results and it does show a preserved. Yeah, of 55% abnormal diastolic filling and mild to moderate mitral regurgitation. So let me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan. So for your first problem for your congestive heart failure, it sounds like this was caused by dietary and discretion and some uncontrolled hypertension. So I want you to continue on your Bumex 2 milligrams once daily continue to watch your diet and avoid salty foods might try keeping that log we talked about with your blood pressures. And what you've eaten if your blood pressure seems a little high also way yourself daily and call me if you gain 3 pounds in two days okay.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  And I also want you to see a nutritionist to give you some education about what foods you can eat okay now for your second problem for I know this sounds like this is just for you and so for your second problem for your hypertension I want you to continue on the COSAR 100 milligrams daily continue on the norvask 5 milligrams once daily also And I'm going to order a renal artery ultrasound just to be sure where not missing anything and then like maybe you know some renal artery stenosis or something and so so for your third problem for your kidney disease I want to get some more labs to make sure you tolerate this the new medications and then I'll see you again in three months do you have any questions\n[patient]  No, I don't think so not today.\n[doctor]  Alright, it's good to see you and I hope we'll just keep getting you feeling better.\n[patient]  Okay.",

Or is it just something that started slowly or?\n[patient]  It just kind of started on its own it. I noticed it mostly at night.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  Sometimes it will all wake up and my hands are asleep and I got to shake it out.\n[doctor]  Shake it out and okay.\n[patient]  and then some.\n[doctor]  What kind of work do you do?\n[patient]  I do yard work.\n[doctor]  Yard work.\n[patient]  landscaping landscaping.\n[doctor]  landscaping okay so a lot of raking a lot of digging so a lot of repetitive type movements\n[patient]  Yeah, it's pretty heavy labor, but it's yeah, the same thing day in and day out.\n[doctor]  Okay, okay, just a couple questions for you. You did say that you have the pain at night in that, and you have to get that numbness into the hand. Is it in all the fingers?\n[patient]  It seems to happen to all my fingers, but I notice it more in my thumb and pointer finger.\n[doctor]  Okay, okay. And anything into that little into your fifth finger, your little finger, any numbness they're at times now.\n[patient]  Sometimes, yeah, it seems like it's number two.\n[doctor]  Okay, what about your right hand? Any problems with that hand?\n[patient]  Now I don't seem to have any problems with my right hand, so far it's just mostly my left.\n[doctor]  Okay, okay, good. And just a couple, you know, do you have many or do you drink often? Do you have you know many any alcohol consumption?\n[patient]  I drink usually a beer or two on Fridays and Saturdays on the weekends.\n[doctor]  Okay, and do you have any evidence of anybody ever said that you had some rheumatoid arthritis in your hand or wrist anything like that?\n[patient]  Nobody say anything like that, so I mean.\n[doctor]  Okay, okay, good. So let me go ahead and do a physical exam here real quick. And you know I'm gonna quickly just listen to your heart and lums, okay? That's good. I'd like you to squeeze. I'm gonna hold your hands here. And I'd like you to squeeze both hands.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  You seem a little bit weaker on that left hand, is that what you've noticed.\n[patient]  Yeah, I experienced some weakness in my left hand.\n[doctor]  Okay do you find that you're dropping things when you're picking it up is it to that level or?\n[patient]  Yeah, I drop things mostly because I have a hard time feeling it.\n[doctor]  Okay, okay, good. And so you do have a grip strength is less on the left. And I just want to touch your fingers here on the on the right side, you can feel me touching all the fingers on the right.\n[patient]  Yeah, I can say you touch me, but it feels a little more weird on the thumb side than my pointer finger side.\n[doctor]  Okay, okay. And I want to turn your wrist over here and turn your hand over. And I'm going to go ahead and tap on the right wrist on the back. Here does that do anything when I do that.\n[patient]  I still feel a little jolt or a zing in my fingertips.\n[doctor]  Okay, and then when I do that on the left side.\n[patient]  Yes, same thing.\n[doctor]  Same thing, okay. So you do have a bilateral positive to Nell sign. So here's here's where I'm at, I think, your diagnosis is beginning to have some bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome. Usually we see that with repetitive actions such as the landscaping, the heavy labor, and you know you're your clinical exam. And history sound like it's a carpal tunnel syndrome. I do want to order so where are we going to go from here? I would like to order a study. It's called an EMG where it measures some of that electrical impulses down into your fingers. We will follow up with that. But as far as your treatment, so the treatment for carpal tunnel syndrome is really some activity modification. Now I know you are a landscaper. Is there any way that you could be work to have some lighter work during the time?\n[patient]  I suppose I could try to pass it off to some of my other employees and delegate.\n[doctor]  Okay, that would be good. So that's I just want you to kind of eliminate that the active repetitive motions that you're doing all the time just for a couple weeks. I'm also going to give you a wrist splint to wear and that should help and I'd like you to take ibuprofen 600 milligrams every six hours and then I want to see you back here in the office in two weeks and in that two week period I think we're going to see if there's need for any other intervention if I need to do more diagnostic testing or if there's a possibly looking at a surgical intervention to release that pressure that's on the nerves in that hand does that sound like a good plan for you.\n[patient]  It sounds like a good first start.\n[doctor]  Okay, okay, so I just just off off the record. Here, what kind of what do you specialize in landscaping is your company do?\n[patient]  Mostly like yard work and maintenance flower beds, not really designing, just upkeep.\n[doctor]  Okay, yeah, I'm looking for a landscape designer. I need somebody to put in some elaborate walkways back through the backyard. So, yeah, we can do stuff like that. I mean, if you have an idea, what you want, I think that's easy.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  You know, if you're looking for like some...\n[patient]  Backyard Ellis's rehab remodel, that's I mean I suppose we could do we haven't done things like that in a while because we're busy enough with just the up key but it's something to explore.\n[doctor]  Okay, I may have to keep that in mind because I do want to do some of that. So let's listen, I'm going to get my nurse in here to discharge you. Do you have any other questions for me before we end this?\n[patient]  No, I think it's all clear I appreciate it.\n[doctor]  Okay take care and I'll look forward to see you in two weeks.\n[patient]  Very good appreciate your time.",

It's just a procedure we'll stick a needle in your elbow.\n[patient]  You do a stick needle in my elbow.\n[doctor]  and help with some of the healing of your elbow.\n[patient]  So it's kind of like dry, needling then.\n[doctor]  No.\n[patient]  Not all.\n[doctor]  What is it?\n[patient]  Is it that that thing where you take the blood out of, like, same on my thigh?\n[doctor]  Hmm.\n[patient]  and then you literally inject it into my tendon.\n[doctor]  Yes.\n[patient]  that it activates the healing.\n[doctor]  Yeah, that's exactly what it is.\n[patient]  Interesting cool.\n[doctor]  Yeah\n[patient]  Maybe I have heard about that.\n[doctor]  We've had some really good responses from other patients on it, so hopefully I mean that should be a good solution for you since you've been having issues with this.\n[patient]  I'm excited.\n[doctor]  Yeah, and we can hopefully get you scheduled for that in the next couple of weeks.

I've really surprised because I've been feeling fine they had done it as you know a screen as just part of my physical. So I'm really surprised that that came back positive.\n[patient]  Okay, so in the past, have any doctors ever told you that you had Hep C?\n[doctor]  No never that's why I'm so surprised.\n[patient]  Okay, so just you know I need to ask do you have a history of four drug use or you know I've known any HEPC partners?\n[doctor]  I mean I used to party a lot and even did use four drugs but I have been clean for over 15 years now.\n[patient]  Okay, that's good. I mean, I'm happy that you were able to kick that habit. I know a lot of my patients that I see you know they're still dealing with with those demands. So I'm I'm happy that you're able to do that.

So hopefully we can help you out. You know, if your PCP hasn't prescribed something for you already, and possibly we can do that for you as well.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  So do you have any other medical conditions?\n[doctor]  No, I'm actually other than that I just had my physical and I'm not taking any medications no, I'm pretty good otherwise.\n[patient]  Okay, and what conditions would you say running your family?\n[doctor]  I have high blood pressure diabetes and depression.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Alright, so let me go ahead and do a quick physical exam on you. So I reviewed your vitals and everything looks good. And on general appearance, you appear to be in no distress, no jaundice on the skin on your heart exam. You have a nice regular rhythm rate.\n[patient]  Regular rate and rhythm with a grade two out of six istolic ejection murmur is appreciated on your lung. Exam your lungs are clear without weasers rals or ronkey on your abdominal exam ball sounds. A present your abdomen is soft with no hepatosplenamegaly.\n[doctor]  Hepato's plenamegaly. Yes, let me. I will change that one.\n[patient]  Splendor Megaly and on your muscle exam, there is no gate disturbance or edema. So I did what I was able to review your results of your recent lab work. And your HCV antibody test was positive. So you're your liver panel. We did one of those. And it showed an elevated AST at 39. But you're all albumin and total bilirubin were all within normal limits. So that's pretty good. So let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you. So you do have hepatitis C. So your initial labs were consistent with that hep C diagnosis. And so you know, I don't know if you read much about hep C. But hepatitis C is a viral infection that does affect your liver. And you've most likely had it for several years now. And it most patients don't see symptoms until years later. So the next step that I would like to do is just confirm the diagnosis with some additional blood work. So that includes checking your hep C RNA and your HCV genotype. And I would also like to determine the severity of your liver. Disease by checking for fibrosis of the liver. And we will do that by ordering an ultrasound alasto-elastography. With this information, we will be able to know how we can proceed as far as treatment writes. So how does that sound?\n[doctor]  I am so, I do have a wife and kids, so should I be worried about them.\n[patient]  Okay, yeah. So we can start with the same screening that you had for August first. So we'll just let's do that Hep C antibody test. And I'll actually help you set up those appointments with your family doctor. And then we can just see you back in three weeks. And based on the results, you know, we will take action as needed. Okay.\n[doctor]  Okay, that sounds good.\n[patient]  All right.\n[doctor]  Alright.\n[patient]  My nurse will be in with those orders.\n[doctor]  All right, thank you.\n[patient]  Alright, thanks.\n[doctor]  Bye.",

            "src": "[doctor]  Hi Virginia, how are you today? What brings you in?\n[patient]  I'm doing all right. I started seeing this new PCP last year and you know, she's been doing a lot of changes to my medication and making sure everything is up to date and she might notice that my blood pressure has been quite high. So she added to medications, but and but you know, I've been taking them. I've been really good and I before I wasn't, but now I am and we're still having a hard time controlling my blood pressure. So she thought it would be a good idea for me to see you especially since she noted some of my last blood work. She said something about my kidneys.\n[doctor]  Okay, yes so okay, let's before I dive into a lot of that tell me a little bit about how you've been feeling.\n[patient]  I would say you know most of the days I feel fine, I'm still busy at work. I definitely can tell though my blood pressure is high.\n[doctor]  Okay, you measure it at home, you measure your blood pressure at home.\n[patient]  Yeah, I should want to get a blood pressure cuff, so I did start getting checking my blood pressures probably like a few times a week.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  And so then I noticed that it has been getting higher the other day was even as high as 170 over 90.\n[doctor]  Wow.\n[patient]  So I did call my PCP and she increased the meds again.\n[doctor]  Okay, now I just have a couple questions about that are you using an electronic blood pressure recorder or do you have somebody help you at home?\n[patient]  Yes, I have an electronic one and an electronic arm one.\n[doctor]  Okay, okay, yeah, that's good, that's good. And have you ever tried to go to CVS at all?\n[patient]  Yeah, I do, but I've noticed like since the pandemic, I don't see the blood pressures anymore.\n[doctor]  Okay, okay, I, I thought the one down on Main Street, they I thought they just brought that one back so.\n[patient]  today.\n[doctor]  Yeah\n[patient]  That's good to know.\n[doctor]  You may want to check that, but okay, so that's good, but I what I'd like you to do with that is I'd like you to keep a record of them for me for my next visit with you. So let's talk a little bit about your diet, tell me how how is your diet, what are the what kind of foods do you like, what do you eat normally?\n[patient]  Already won the honest answer.\n[doctor]  Well, yeah, that would be better.\n[patient]  So I really know with everything going on I really been trying to get better but I mean during football season it's really difficult I really love watching my games so I have a lot of pizza wings of like I said I've been trying to cut down especially on days where there's no games but it probably could be better.\n[doctor]  Okay, I think we all can say that, but I do want to just say I don't know that if you've tried it or not, but there's a new restaurant down on 5th Street and it is nothing but solids. And I know when I heard this, I was like, okay, yeah, it's just another these solids are absolutely amazing. So if you ever get a chance, yeah, if you ever get a chance, try try that. I mean, I think you would enjoy them because they're solids that they make are just out. Unbelievable. So let me go ahead and I just have a few more questions and I'm going to just ask these in an order and you just tell me and then we will come back and talk about them. Do you have any headaches?\n[patient]  Really just when my blood pressure gets really high, I have some mild headaches, but otherwise, I don't have it on a regular basis.\n[doctor]  Okay, what about chest pain?\n[patient]  No chest pain.\n[doctor]  shortness of breath.\n[patient]  No shortness of breath.\n[doctor]  even with exertion.\n[patient]  even with exertion.\n[doctor]  Okay, do you have any swelling in your lower extremities at all that you noticed?\n[patient]  Not if I'm on my feet for a long time, I'll notice a little bit of swelling, but otherwise no.\n[doctor]  Okay, and then a couple other family history questions. Anybody in the family have kidney disease or significant high blood pressure?\n[patient]  Both my parents do have high blood pressure and one of them did have kidney disease.\n[doctor]  Okay, okay. And in the the form that you filled out when you came in it says that you are on 10 milligrams of norbask daily and Carved Isle-A-L, 25 milligrams twice a day, is those the medicines you're on.\n[patient]  Yes, I was also on my CinePro before, but with the adjustments, yeah, those are the ones I'm on.\n[doctor]  Okay, and so here's where I think we are going to go do you take any non-steroidal like Advil or Motrin or leave?\n[patient]  It just wants in a while for my like any knee pain or back pain that I have, but again not like every day.\n[doctor]  Okay, and then lastly, what kind of alcohol intake do you have you know do you consider how many drinks a week is really what I'm looking for?\n[patient]  I'll have a couple of beers during the week and like one or two on the weekends.\n[doctor]  Okay, okay, so let me do a quick physical examination. So I looked at your vitals when you came in today and your blood pressure, it's still high, it's 169 over 70 for your heart rate, was 88, and your oxygenation was 98%. So those are all fairly good except that blood pressures a little higher than we'd like to see now. When I look at your neck, I don't see any jugular vein distension and I'm going to listen. Here real quick, no, I don't hear any carotid brewed going to listen to your lungs, okay, your lungs are clear. And let me listen quickly to your heart, I do hear that a two over six systolic ejection murmur. And we're going to have to take a little bit look extra look at that. That's when I can hear an extra sound when I'm listening to your heart. And you do have a small amount of one plus pitting a Dima bilaterally now I did. So you do have that your diagnosis is uncontrolled hypertension you know, and I think you're aware that that's what you're you're physicians been treating you for and most of the time this cause is is the cause of this is multifactorial it's not that there is just one thing causing it so we may need to be changing your medicine around and I'm going to talk to your doctor. But first thing before we make any more medication changes I want to order some tests first to rule out if there is any specific cause for this so first order will be a renal artery ultrasound. And what I'm looking for there is that there is no areas of areas of narrowing into the blood vessels of your kidneys that would be the cause of your hypertension in addition to that I'm going to order a you get another urine collection some morning El Dostro and levels raining levels and a 24 hour urine and these things can really show me if there is any problems with your adrenal glands again this is a lot of big words. But you know I might I'll write this all out for you I want you to decrease your alcohol I know you like those beers but let's bring it down to maybe one a week or two a week just to get those down lower and then your salt intake you need to be very judicious about decreasing that salt intake I'm going to give you a referral to a nutritionist to discuss those changes for that you need and then they will help you get that cleared up and then finally stop taking any non-steroidal medicines such as your advelle or motrin the only thing I really want to want you taking is Tylenol for any pain right now I am going to prescribe one medicine and that's Cardura for milligrams and I want you to take that once a day and that's good to see if that can help us with your blood pressure and then finally three weeks I'd like you to return I want you to record all of your blood pressures that you take over the next three weeks and bring them into the office but most importantly if you can try to take them at the same time every day that would be beneficial for me any questions for me.\n[patient]  Now I just, it's a lot, so I'm hoping this will work and this will get under control.\n[doctor]  Yeah, I think you know this, we'll be you know this, we're going to spend some time together. So I'm glad to have you as a patient, but you know we got to try to get this under control, and I'm going to be talking to your PCP just to let them know that you know what my plans are, and we'll stay real and sync on treating this as we move forward. Does that sound like a plan?\n[patient]  That sounds good, thank you.\n[doctor]  Okay, take care I'll talk to you later.\n[patient]  Okay, all right, bye.",

            "src": "[doctor]  Carolyn is a 34-year-old female with a history of diabetes melatist type 2, who is here today with a headache. So, hi there, Carolyn. It's nice to see you again. Listen, I'm sorry you're having headaches. Well, let's talk about it, but I would like to record this conversation with this app that's going to help me focus on you more wood that be okay with you.\n[patient]  Yes, that's okay.\n[doctor]  Okay, great. Thanks so Carolyn. Tell me about your headache and headache or headaches when did when did they start and and what symptoms are you having?\n[patient]  My headache started about a week ago. It's feeling like a dull pain in the back of my head. I have flushing in my ears, they get really red and hot. And sometimes I just feel a little bit dizzy when I get these headaches. But I've taken Tylenol and Advil, and it's not really going away. It just keeps coming back.\n[doctor]  Okay, and all right, and so this started about a week ago, has it been fairly constant since it started or does it come and go does it come and go or what?\n[patient]  It comes and goes out to relieve when I take my Tylenol or Advil, but then it comes right back.\n[doctor]  Okay, and do you notice any any timing difference you know is it is it worse in the morning worse in the evening? Is there anything else that makes it better or worse?\n[patient]  It's definitely worse in the evening.\n[doctor]  Okay, and do you feel any sort of tightness in the back of your neck or in your shoulders or you know you said it's in the back of your head primarily, any discomfort anywhere else?\n[patient]  Yes, no, just in the back of my head.\n[doctor]  Okay, and did the headache start all of a sudden carol in, or has it been gradual or what?\n[patient]  I've been under a lot of stress lately, so maybe about when some stress started occurring.\n[doctor]  Okay, okay. And all right. And have you noticed any fever along with the headache?\n[patient]  No no fever.\n[doctor]  Okay, and any visual changes, you know, wavy lines in your vision spots in your vision, or anything like that.\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  Okay, and have you had headaches like this before?\n[patient]  I have.\n[doctor]  Okay, so this isn't the worst headache you've ever had, what did you say?\n[patient]  No, it's not.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right, and so okay fair enough now how's your diabetes been been been doing lately? Have you what have your blood sugars been running in the low 100s or 200s or what?\n[patient]  I haven't been checking my blood sugars.\n[doctor]  Really okay, well we will get you back on that. And we can talk about that, but how about your metformin? Are you still taking the 500 milligrams once a day? No actually, it looks like we increased your metformin to 500 milligrams twice a day last visit. Are you still taking that?\n[patient]  Yes.\n[doctor]  Okay, great. And okay, you're still watching your diet and getting some exercise.\n[patient]  I have not been eating well because I've been stressed over the last week, but I haven't been exercising for maybe the past week, but generally I've been doing better.\n[doctor]  Okay, the headache has this maybe made you feel uncomfortable and prevented your exercise. Would you say or what?\n[patient]  Yes it has.\n[doctor]  Okay, okay, so you probably haven't been out golfing. I remember you're a big golfer. So not not lately. So you know being\n[patient]  Not lately.\n[doctor]  Being down, being down here in Florida, we got Tuggett get some golf fins. So, hey, did you see the masters, by the way, a few weeks ago, wasn't that I don't know, did you happen to catch it?\n[patient]  I did.\n[doctor]  Yes, that was crazy. What a what a finish, what an amazing, what an amazing tournament. Right, what do you think? Yeah, that's great. Well, we'll get you feeling better and get you back out there. And now are you still working a lot on the computer AC or?\n[patient]  I am.\n[doctor]  Carolyn, okay. Yeah, you're still working a lot on the computer for work. Okay, are you taking breaks every hour or so you know, get up, stand around, walk, stand, walk around that can be helpful.\n[patient]  No, I really don't get the opportunity too.\n[doctor]  Okay, understood. All right, well listen, let's go ahead and examine you okay. So on your physical exam, your physical exam is pretty normal, unremarkable for the most part. And you know a few things, a few exceptions. So first of all, on your heen exam, your eye exam, your extracurricular motions are intact. Without pain, you have a fundoscopic exam that shows no papaladema that's good that just means there's no swelling in the back. Of your eye and on your neck exam, you do have some posterior mild. Here you're paraspinal muscular tenderness in the cervical spine and in bilateral trapezius musculature as well and some tightness in those muscles as well. And otherwise on your exam, let's see your heart exam on your heart exam. You have that grade three out of six systolic ejection murmur that's unchanged from your prior exam. So it just means I hear some sounds in your heart as it's beating and I'm not too worried about that will. Watch that and otherwise normal heart exam and your physical examination otherwise is normal and unremarkable. And so now let's talk about my assessment and your plan. So Carolyn, for your first problem of the headache, I do think that you have a tension type headache. And I think this because you've got some tension and tightness in your paraspinal muscles, meaning the muscles around your neck and your shoulders. And you know working at the computer, I think, is contributing to this and also probably the stress so you can continue to take that Tylenol for the pain. I'm also going to give you a mild muscle relax and I'll write you for flexural five milligrams three times a day. And you can take that that will help relax those muscles in your neck and that should help with the symptoms I want you to come back or give us a call if the headaches become more severe or suddenly worse in or you develop a fever. But I don't think that this is a sign of a stroke or any bleeding in your brain or anything like that. I think it's more related to tightness in your muscles in your neck now for your second problem of your diabetes mellitus. Let's continue you on the metformin 500 milligrams. I am going to order a hemoglobin A1c and also a CBC and a chem 12 to check some of your blood tests, blood chemistries and so forth. And we will continue you on the metformin. I do want you to check your blood sugars daily and that will be very helpful. So when you come back in a month, I want you to bring those numbers with you. We can talk about it again and please do try to get back into your exercise routine. That's really going to help you keep those blood sugars under control as well. Okay. So how does that sound for a plan? Any other questions for me?\n[patient]  What would it so only call if it gets worse or not any better?\n[doctor]  Yeah, that that just right, but also let's set up an appointment in four weeks, and I want to see you back in four weeks. If it's not if the headache is not better within the next few days with this flexoril, then you can give us a call, and then get back in later this week, or early next, but definitely if things get worse, give us a call sooner. And you know, I'm going to ask you, and I wanted to ask if you had a history of any any trauma meaning have you. Hit your head, or you haven't fallen, hit your head, or anything like that have you.\n[patient]  No, no, I think it's just stress.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right, understood. Okay. Great. Well, then I'll see you back in a month if not before. Okay, you take care of yourself. Nice seeing you.\n[patient]  Thank you.\n[doctor]  Sure.",

You're not feeling well.\n[patient]  Yeah, my throat has been hurting me for like four, four days now, and I think I had a fever last night, because I was really sweaty, but I didn't take my temperature, because I was already in bed.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right, so four days ago you started feeling badly. Okay, now are you having chills?\n[patient]  The last night I was chouls and I had a lot of sweating and it's really hard to swallow.\n[doctor]  It's really hard to swallow, okay? Now do you have pain every time you swallow? Or is it just periodically?\n[patient]  Every time I swallow, I'm even having trouble eating, I can drink okay the like really cold water feels good.\n[doctor]  Okay, that's what I was going to ask you, okay, so you're able to drink water. And are you able to drink any other fluids? Have you been able to drink any, you know, I don't know juices or milkshakes or anything like that?\n[patient]  Well besides my wine at night, I really just drink water all day.\n[doctor]  Okay, well I like to drink wine, too what's your favorite type of wine?\n[patient]  Peanut grooves, yes.\n[doctor]  It's a good one I like that too. I am also a pinot of our fans. So there you go. All right. Well, let's now do you feel sick to your stomach at all?\n[patient]  Now I have a little bit of a stuffy nose not too bad, it's really just my throat, but I think my tonsils are swollen too.\n[doctor]  and your tonsils are swollen too now has anyone else sick in your household.\n[patient]  I do have little kids that go to school. So they've always got you know those little running noses or cough, but nobody is really complaining of anything.\n[doctor]  Okay, alright now have you had strep throw in the past?\n[patient]  When I was a kid I had strep throat, but I haven't had anything like that as an adult.\n[doctor]  Okay, alright. And what do you do for work?\n[patient]  I work as a cashier in the supermarket.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right. And did you get your COVID vaccine?\n[patient]  Yep, I did get my COVID vaccine, but it really made me feel sick, so I'm hoping I don't have to get another one later this year.\n[doctor]  Okay, did. So you just got the two vaccines you didn't get the booster.\n[patient]  Now I didn't get the booster because I really haven't had time to feel that sick again. It really knocked me down for like two days and with the little kids it's really hard.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right, well I saw that they did a rapid COVID test when you came in here. And that was negative, so that's good, so you don't have COVID, which is which is good now. Let's talk a little bit about your hypertension and hypertension since I have you here to do ever by that blood pressure cuff that I ask you to buy.\n[patient]  Yes, I did, I blood the blood pressure cuff, and my blood pressure is like all over the place. Sometimes it could be like 120 for the top number, sometimes it could be 140 for the top number. I don't really remember the bottom number though.\n[doctor]  Okay, that's okay. Are you taking the lysinopril? I think we have you on 20 milligrams a day.\n[patient]  Yep, I take it every morning with my multivitamin and my vitamin D.\n[doctor]  Okay, alright, and are you watching your salt intake?\n[patient]  I really like my chips with my wine.\n[doctor]  Isn't that the best way we could get along really well outside of here, all right? And then tell me a little bit about your diabetes. Now, are you watching your blood sugars? Are you taking them at home?\n[patient]  Sometimes I take that all that often again, that could be all over the place. Sometimes I get if I take it first thing in the morning it'll be like 80 or 90, but at night sometimes it could be 140.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right. And I are you still taking them at 4, and we have you on a thousand milligrams twice a day.\n[patient]  Yes, I do take it, I take it with my breakfast and with my dinner.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right, great. All right. Now are you a meds fan or a Yankees fan or God for a bit of Philly's fan?\n[patient]  Nope.\n[doctor]  No.\n[patient]  They don't like sports.\n[doctor]  Don't like sports just the wine.\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right. Well, let's go ahead. I want to just do a quick physical exam. Now I'm going to be calling out some of my findings and I'm going to let you know what that means when I'm done. Okay. So looking here first at your vital signs, your vital signs look pretty good. You do have a low grade fever of about a hundred for right now. But otherwise your blood pressure is pretty good. It's about 132 over 80 and your heart rate is 84 now. That looks pretty good. So I'm just going to go ahead and examine you. So on your facial exam, I'm going to just press on your face here. Does this hurt?\n[patient]  No, not no, it doesn't bother me.\n[doctor]  Okay, on facial examination, the patient has no pain to palpation of the frontal or maxillary sinuses on nasal examination. There is edema and erythema of the nasal terminates, bilaterally, with associated clear discharge, open up your mouth and say.\n[patient]  Ah\n[doctor]  On throat examination, there is bilateral erythema and edema of the peritonsular space, with exudates present bilaterally the uvula is midline on your neck exam. I do appreciate some cervical lymphedenopathy on the right hand side on your lung exam. Your lungs, you have some coarse ronky at the bases that clear with cough, and on your heart exam, your heart is a nice regular rate. And rhythm, I don't appreciate any. Murmur or rub. So what does all of that mean to Risa? So all of that means is that yes. You're showing signs of what we call an upper respiratory infection. And I'm concerned that you might have some strep in the back of your throat based on the findings. So let's just talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you okay. So for your first problem of your sore throat, I'm going to go ahead and have the medical assistant come in and swab you for a rapid strep test. And if that's positive, I want to go ahead and place you on or prescribe a Moxicillin 500 milligrams three times a day for 10 days. And I'm going to give you some Lydocaine swish and swallow so that will help with some of the pain. And you can take some ibuprofen as needed, which will also help with the pain. And some of that fever, okay, I do want you to go ahead and continue to to hydrate as much as possible what kind of questions do you have about that.\n[patient]  Know that sounds good, I just wanted to be sure I was okay, because of the little kids.\n[doctor]  Sure now for your next problem of your hypertension, I want to go ahead and order a lipid panel on you. And I think I do want to increase, I do want to increase the lysinopryl to 40 milligrams once a day just to get your blood pressure under better control. And we'll see how you do on the 40 milligrams once a day for your third problem of your diabetes. Let's go ahead and order a hemoglobin A1c and just to make sure that we don't have to make any adjustments to your metformin.

How are you?\n[patient]  I'm doing alright other than this ankle pain I've been having.\n[doctor]  So, I see here that you hurt your right ankle, can you tell me what happened?\n[patient]  Yeah, so yesterday I was gonna take out the trash and it was quite icy. I thought I was doing okay job and I just slipped and then fell and I'm pretty sure I heard a pop.\n[doctor]  Okay, and you said this happened yesterday correct.\n[patient]  Yeah.\n[doctor]  Okay, and have you been able to walk on it at all?\n[patient]  No, I was so initially when I first fell, I was unable to walk it on it at all. I had a friend that was visiting and so she heard me fall. So she helped me inside now today. I have been able to put a little bit more weight on it, but I'm still limping.\n[doctor]  Okay, and then what have you been doing for your foot or ankle pain since that happened?\n[patient]  So I like iced it last night and kept it elevated and I also took some ibuprofen last night and This morning before coming in today\n[doctor]  Okay, and can you rate your pain for me?\n[patient]  I would say right now it's like a 4 out of 10.\n[doctor]  Okay, and does the ibuprofen help with that pain?\n[patient]  It does it does help with the pain.\n[doctor]  Okay, and when you take your ibuprofen, what can you what's your pain level then?\n[patient]  So this, so what did I just say for?\n[doctor]  Yes ma'am.\n[patient]  For out of 10, so 4 out of 10 is with ibuprofen.\n[doctor]  It's with ibuprofen, okay. What's your pain level without then?\n[patient]  I would say probably six.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  I'm sorry it's 6 out of 10 without ibuprofen and it goes down to like a 1 with ibuprofen.\n[doctor]  Okay, alright that sounds good have you ever injured that foot and ankle before?\n[patient]  You know, I've had a lot of injuries to my ankle, but I've never hurt this ankle before. I just realized an error.\n[doctor]  Okay, you know, and I see here that you have a history of playing sports looks like you played soccer in college and then played a little bit of an inner marrow soccer now.\n[patient]  Yeah.\n[doctor]  I'm guessing you probably haven't been able to do that since you hurt your ankle.\n[patient]  No, I have not been.\n[doctor]  So did you hear about the new Major League soccer stadium and team that's coming to tell they opened in the this year? Actually, they built the stadium. Have you been down there yet?\n[patient]  Now I have to get there.\n[doctor]  Yeah, we are all excited it's going to be a good time. I'll have you experienced any numbness or tingling in that right foot.\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  Okay, so if it's okay with you, I would like to do a quick physical exam. Your vitals look good. And everything there looks okay. Now I'm going to do a focused exam on your right ankle. I do appreciate some echinmosis or bruising over the lateral maliolis maliolis associated with some edema or swelling of that area. You are positive for tenderness to palpation of the anterior lateral soft tissue. And now I don't appreciate any. Lactity on anterior drawer and inversion stress, there is no bony tenderness on. Palpation to that foot or ankle area. Now on neurovascular exam of your right foot, you have brisk capillary refill of less than three seconds strong dorsalus pedispulse. And your sensation is intact to light touch. And all of that is consistent with what's present on your left side as well. So I did review the results of your of your x-ray, the x-ray of your right ankle showed no fracture, which is a good thing. So now let me talk to you a little bit about my assessment and plan. So for the first problem of right ankle pain, your symptoms are consistent with a right ankle sprain or I'm sorry right ankle sprain of your lateral ligament complex. More specifically your anterior talofibular ligament. Now this ligament's on the outside of your ankle ankle, which got stretched when you fell the best treatment at this time for your sprain is to keep your leg elevated when you're seated. And let's continue to ice okay, you're going to be given an air cast, which is going to help stabilize that ankle and eye. Also going to prescribe some crutches because I want you to stay off that leg and start walking on it stay off your leg for now. And then in a couple of days start walking on it as tolerated. Do you have any questions or concerns for me?\n[patient]  So how long do you think it'll take to heal?\n[doctor]  So your symptoms should significantly improve over a few weeks, but I'd like to follow up with you and see how you're doing. Let's say I'll see you again in 14 days now. I do want you to go ahead and continue to take NSAIDS or IB Profen as needed to help with any pain and that's also going to help reduce that inflammation and swelling. Okay.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Alright, I will see you again in two weeks, Carolyn.\n[patient]  Great thank you.\n[doctor]  You're welcome.",

This was her first right ankle injury. She believes she heard a pop at the time, but denies any associated numbness or tingling. Initially, she was unable to bear weight on the ankle and required help getting inside; however, she is now able to slightly bear weight but ambulates with an antalgic gait. Ice, elevation, and ibuprofen have been helpful at reducing her pain. She rates her current pain as 4/10, her pain without medication as 6/10, and her pain with medication as 1/10.\n\nOf note, the patient participates in an intramural soccer league but has not been able to play since this injury.\n\nMEDICAL HISTORY\n\nThe patient reports that she has had several ankle injuries in the past.

We had a lengthy discussion regarding the nature of this injury and the course of treatment. I advised her to keep her leg elevated when she is seated and continue to ice her ankle. She should also continue taking ibuprofen as-needed for pain and inflammation management. She will be placed in an Aircast to help stabilize her ankle, and I am going to order crutches so she can remain non-weight-bearing for the next couple of days. At that point, she can start bearing weight on the ankle as tolerated.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nThe patient will follow up in 2 weeks.",

I'm just ready to quit smoking and but I've been having quite a hard time with it.\n[doctor]  Well, I'm glad that you're taking the first steps to quit smoking. Would you tell me a little bit more about your history of smoking?\n[patient]  Yeah, so I've been smoking for some time now, I started in high school and was just, you know, just experimenting and smoking here and there with friends or at parties and then just started getting more regular and regular and I don't even know how I'm 44 now and I'm smoking every day. So yes, now I'm up to a pack and half a day.\n[doctor]  Okay, do you use any other type of tobacco products?\n[patient]  No smoking is enough.\n[doctor]  Okay, and I understand that so. When you wake up in the morning, how soon after waking up, do you smoke your first cigarette?\n[patient]  I would say probably within an hour of waking up, I'll have my first cigarette.\n[doctor]  Okay, so I'm really excited that you want to quit and I know that you probably heard this multiple times before. But this really is one of the best things that you can do to help your health especially since you have the history of Gout and type 2 diabetes. This is really going to be a great step in you having better long term health outcomes.\n[patient]  Yeah, I know and you know I'm really motivated now because I am about to be a father any day now and I just really want to be there for my daughter growing up\n[doctor]  Hey, that's great. And that's great to hear. Congratulations. I'm so excited to hear about the new baby.\n[patient]  Yeah.\n[doctor]  I have a daughter myself, have you picked out any names?\n[patient]  Where you know we're deciding between a few names, but we're kind of just waiting to see her to see which name fits.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right, that sounds good. Well, congratulations again. I'm very excited for you and your, and your wife that that's this is great.\n[patient]  Thank you.\n[doctor]  So you mentioned you tried to quit before. Can you tell me a little bit about the methods that you used or what you tried?\n[patient]  Yeah, actually I just went cold turkey one day. I woke up and I said, you know, I've had enough. And I know that smoking is not good for me. So I woke up and stopped. And I actually did really well. And I was able to quit smoking for almost a year. And then things just started getting really stressful at work. They started laying people off. And I'm happy. I still have a job. But that also meant that I was responsible for more things so things just got stressful. And I just started picking it up again.\n[doctor]  While you are absolutely correct you know stress can often be a trigger for things like smoking and drinking have you thought what you would do this time when you encountered the stressful situations.\n[patient]  Yeah, I didn't think about that a lot actually, and one thing is I have started learning and trying to do more meditation, and then I also just recently joined the gym. So I'm really looking forward to working out again.\n[doctor]  Okay, well that's great to hear that you're getting back in the gym that will be good for your long-term health too. You know helping to maintain that type 2 diabetes. You know those are really great strategies talking about gym for stress relief. And you know we have other products as well that you can use for an additional aid to help you stop smoking. Have you given any thought to using some type of smoking cessation aid at this time? Or what do you think about that?\n[patient]  You know I've had you know because I've been trying to do cold turkey and it's not working and some of my friends actually have mentioned using a patch and they they've had some success with that. So I think I would probably want to start with that.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right, that sounds good. It's good that you've picked out one of those aids and have you thought of a quit date. I mean, we really want to talk about when you're going to say this is the day.\n[patient]  Yano next Monday is actually my birthday. So, I think that's a good day.\n[doctor]  That's a fantastic day, and Happy Birthday coming up on Monday.\n[patient]  Thank you.\n[doctor]  So let's talk a little bit about your exam here, okay? I'm gonna go ahead and do a quick physical exam, and I reviewed your vitals, and everything looks good, including your oxygen saturation blood pressure for today, was 128 over 88 heart rate, was 68 respirations were 16, and your pulse ox was 98% on room air. So those were all really good now on your heart exam, you do have a nice regular. And your your rate is a regular rate and rhythm or I'm. Sorry, your heart exam for your heart exam notice that your heart is regular in rate, and rhythm I do however still appreciate that two over six isolic murmur that we talked about in the past now, that's okay, we'll just continue to monitor that now for your lung exam. I'm gonna go ahead and listen to your lungs, your lungs are clear and equal bilateral with no expiratory weasers and no rals or ronkey are appreciated on your. Next exam, I don't appreciate any lymphedena pathi. When I listen, I don't. Here, any extra noises, so I don't hear any hearing, any carotid brute, which is a good thing now for my impression and plan. Let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you. So for your first problem of nicotine dependence, first of all, I just wanna apply you on making this first step to stop smoking. And I want you to know with absolute 100% certainty that I'm gonna be with you every step of the way I think. It's fantastic that you're very welcome, I, I think it's. Fantastic you've chosen next Monday as a quit date. And on that day, I'm gonna start you with a 21 milligram nicotine patch. And the goal will be to decrease that over time okay. Now we will work together to decrease that. So there is no necessarily hard dates in mind okay. Be sure to change the patch location each day. And that's going to help reduce or avoid that skin irritation that can occur if you use the same location over and over. Again, I would like to see you again in two weeks just to. See how things are going. And we will reevaluate at that time the dosage for your nicotine patch. Now we also see further need to discuss any handouts you received today for those common smoking triggers. I really want you to keep an eye on and monitor your stress level not only about work, but also the fact that you are experiencing are going to be a new father. And we really want to watch any stress you will be experiencing around the birth of your new child. So please keep an eye on that. And let me know how that goes now for now until we meet in two weeks go ahead and keep up your exercise routine. I think that's a great plan. And just try to monitor your stress. And then maybe think about some things like meditation or adding in some yoga and that type of thing to help further work with your stress levels. So do you have any questions for me?\n[patient]  No, not at this time.\n[doctor]  Okay, so for your other conditions that we talked about briefly, your second condition of type 2 diabetes, well let's go ahead and continue to maintain that with diet and exercise. And we'll just monitor your type 2 diabetes. I am going to go ahead and order a hemoglobin A1c for your next blood draw, since I'll see you in two weeks go ahead and have that done. And we will talk about that when you come back in now for your third. Problem of your history of gout. Let's go ahead and continue you on your alopeurinal and just you know continue to watch those foods that will exacerbate your uric acid levels any other questions about those.\n[patient]  Now I think I'd thank so much.\n[doctor]  All right, sounds good. I'll see you in two weeks. Congratulations on the baby and and we're excited about next Monday. That's your quick date.\n[patient]  Alrighty, thank you.\n[doctor]  You're welcome. I'll see you in two weeks. Thanks. Bye. Bye.\n[patient]  Alright, bye.",

How are you doing this morning?\n[patient]  I've been better my primary care doctor wanted me to see you because of this knee pain that I've been having for about six months now.\n[doctor]  Okay, and do you remember what caused the pain initially?\n[patient]  Honestly, I don't I can't think of any time if I fell or like I've really been trying to think and I can't really think of any specific event.\n[doctor]  Okay now it says here that it's in both knees is that correct.\n[patient]  Yes, both my knees.\n[doctor]  Okay, kind of try. Let's let's try describing the pain for me, please.\n[patient]  Yeah, it kind of feels like it's like right behind my kneecaps.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  And it's like a deep, achy pain.\n[doctor]  A deep achy pain, okay. What kind of activities makes the pain feel worse?\n[patient]  Let's see, so anytime, so if I'm sitting in my desk and I get up, I have a lot of pain. So anytime from like standing up from sitting for a while or even going up and down the stairs.\n[doctor]  Okay, so you work from home.\n[patient]  I do.\n[doctor]  Okay, okay, so there is a lot of desk setting at home is your office upstairs or is it I mean do you have to go up or downstairs to get to it?\n[patient]  Nope, well first thing in the morning, but otherwise it's downstairs.\n[doctor]  Okay, okay. How do you like working from home?\n[patient]  You know it has its plus and minuses.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  I like it though, but I like my commute.\n[doctor]  Yeah\n[patient]  I love it.\n[doctor]  And the parking I'm sure the parking is.\n[patient]  and the parking is great.\n[doctor]  Yeah, I know if I could do telehealth visits all day long, I would be totally happy with that. Yeah. And just set it home and do those so you mentioned, is there anything that makes that pain feel better?\n[patient]  Usually I have to like if I feel that pain and then I just it does get better.\n[doctor]  Okay, now you mentioned earlier that you tried some things in the past, what have what are they, and did they work at all?\n[patient]  Yeah, I've done some ibuprofen or leave some time some Tylenol and that does help.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  It takes the edge off.\n[doctor]  Okay, but you're never really pain free. Is that what I hear you saying?\n[patient]  not really unless I'm like really just resting which I hate to do, but otherwise any type of movement, especially from sitting at causes pain.\n[doctor]  Okay, so are you active other than going up and down the steps to your office?\n[patient]  Very I'm a big runner, I love to run, I run about 5 to 6 miles a day. But with this knee width, with these knee pain that I've been having, it's I barely can even do half a mile.\n[doctor]  Yeah, you know what that's, that's I am a biker, and I know that once you get that into your, you know you have loved doing that activity. It's so frustrating when you can't, it's almost like a, it's almost like a dry, it almost becomes a drug when you get up.\n[patient]  Exactly.\n[doctor]  Yeah\n[patient]  It's\n[doctor]  Okay, so have you noticed any redness or swelling in your knees?\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  Okay, and have you ever injured your knees before?\n[patient]  You know despite how active I am I you know I've never.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  injured or broken a bone.\n[doctor]  Okay great, so let's go ahead and do AI just want to take a look here. I reviewed your vitals and overall they look good. Your blood pressure is 120 over 70 or your heart rate is 60 and your respiratory rate is 14. Those are all phenomenal numbers as I listen to your heart. It is at a regular and a slower rate, but I don't hear any extra sounds. So there's no murmurs as we go through that now on musculoskeletal exam. You have a normal gate. I watch to you know kind of walk in. Here this morning your strength. I just want to check it when I go ahead and I want you to move your leg. Okay your muscle strength is as good you do have a three out of five for abduction of your legs bilaterally and that's you know kind of bringing your legs in the remainder of your muscle strength for your lower extremities is a five out of five. Now let me focus specifically on your knee examination. I don't see any redness or echinosis or warmth of the skin and those are big words you know I don't see any bruising or or that redness. There is no effusion that's just like a fluid underneath the knee. I don't appreciate that any at all you do seem to have some tenderness when I palpate and you do have a positive patella grine test when you stood up I could feel that as we went through there you did say you had that knee pain with squatting but your lockman your anterior and posterior drawer and McMurray test are all negative bilaterally. Neurologically and you're you're lower extremities your patella and your Achilles reflex are symmetrical and that's good. So I did review the x-rays of both your knees which shows no fractures or osteoarthritis. So based on what you told me and reviewing the MRI that you had done before you came in your symptoms are consistent with patella femoral pain syndrome and this is a really common condition that we see that causes knee knee pain especially in really active young people. That's probably why I don't get it when I'm riding my bike forever and ever now this condition has to do with the way your knee cap moves across along the groove of your thigh bone your femur. So for pain I want you to continue to take the ibuprofen or any other anti-inflammatories you know a leave or any of those as you need it to help with the pain. Now I am going to recommend physical therapy while they will show you a number of lower extremity exercises this is probably one of the best things that you can do and this will help increase your lower extremities strength your mobility and correct any incorrect running mechanics that you might have do have any questions for me.\n[patient]  So will I be able to run again?\n[doctor]  Absolutely my goal is to get you out there and maybe we can cross pads on the bike trail some day you're gonna have to take it a little bit easy for now but we're gonna get you back and once we do that I think you will be really pleased is there anything else.\n[patient]  No, I think that's it.\n[doctor]  Okay, have a great day.\n[patient]  Okay, you too.\n[doctor]  Thank you.\n[patient]  Bye.",

            "src": "[doctor]  Hi, Abigail, how are you today?\n[patient]  Hello, hi nice to meet you. I'm undoing okay.\n[doctor]  Good on Dr. Sanchez and I'm gonna go ahead and take a look I saw with your notes that you've been having some knee pain yes that's that's true you know it's been going on for while I like to run I do jogs I sign up for the 5k tack you know sometimes the marathon and I haven't been doing longer distances because...\n[patient]  When I'm running on my right knee here, it just starts to ache and it's just at the point where I need your opinion.\n[doctor]  Okay, okay, what have you done for it? So far, what makes it better? What makes it worse?\n[patient]  Well, it used to be that when I run an ache and then I put ice on it and then it would be okay. So I do ice and ibuprofen.\n[doctor]  Okay, okay. And did you see anybody for this before coming into the office here?\n[patient]  Yeah, I doctor would is my primary care provider and I talked to him about it actually over the years and this last visit he said he referred me to you.\n[doctor]  Okay, okay, good so ice and rest makes it feel better running and an activity makes it hurt a little bit more is that correct?\n[patient]  Yeah, that's right.\n[doctor]  Okay, do you have any family history of arthritis or any of those type of immune diseases?\n[patient]  I'm trying to think no, I don't think so no.\n[doctor]  Okay, and do you get as it is this primarily worse in the morning or does it is it just there all the time when it comes on?\n[patient]  It actually is worse towards the end of the day.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  Once I'm on my feet, all day it starts to ache toward the afternoon.\n[doctor]  Okay, so let's go ahead and I want to do a quick examination here, your blood pressure, and was 120 over 60, that's phenomenal. Your heart rate was 58, and you can tell that you're a runner with that, that level of a heart rate, and your respirations were 14. So all of that looked very good, there was no fever. When you came in, when I'm going to just quickly listen to your heart, and lungs, okay, those those sound good. But let me get lets focus here on your lower extremities, I'm I'm going to look at your left knee first, when I move your left knee, do you get any type of pain? Or is it just feel like normal? And it's always your pain's always isolated to the right.\n[patient]  that feels that feels normal.\n[doctor]  Okay, okay, so let me just want you to back up here in the stretcher a little bit more and I'm just going to do some movement of your knee any okay. So I want you to push your leg out against my hand. Does that hurt?\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  Okay, and if you pull back, does that hurt a little bit?\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  Okay, and I'm going to move it around. So when I look at the knee, there is no redness, there's no swelling, I can appreciate a small amount of effusion. And that means that there's a little bit of fluid under the knee or in that knee's joint space. And there is there is several reasons that could be now when I push on your knee, does it hurt more on the inside? Or does it hurt more on the outside here?\n[patient]  So the right knee here hurts on the outside.\n[doctor]  Okay, okay, and you've got a good pedal pull so you know you can feel that and when I touch your feet you don't have any numbness or tingling or anything like that.\n[patient]  Noah\n[doctor]  Okay, well, so what I want to tell you is that I think you have a knee sprain from overuse, and we see that sometimes in runners now, unfortunately, you're going to have to take some a little bit of time off of a back-to-running, but I don't think it will be that long until we can get you up and running again. Now, I review the x-rays that we did when you first came into the office here this morning, and the joint spaces of that right knee are well maintained. I don't see any evidence of any fracture, and when compared to the left knee, everything looks good. So I don't even see any signs of any arthritis that I would have been suspecting I would like you to stay on two Tylenol 500 milligrams and two ibuprofen 200 milligram tablets, and I want you to take that three times a day, and that's going to help with both the pain and the inflammation. I'm also going to order some physical therapy for your right knee and that physical therapy will help strengthen the lower extremities and make it give you a little bit of a balance, and some they'll be able to recommend good running exercises for you. I do want to follow up with you in two weeks and see if we're getting better. So let's know running for two weeks, and if we're improving, then we'll move on and probably start adding some additional activity. Does that sound like a plan?\n[patient]  Yeah, that desire was curious. So I will lay off the running for now. Can I lift weights and do like my squats and in those type of exercises at the gym?\n[doctor]  Yeah, absolutely. And those are good exercises, but I'd like you to get that first physical therapy appointment in. And they'll be able to talk with you on what the best exercises are for you to do.\n[patient]  Okay, got it.\n[doctor]  Any questions?\n[patient]  No, I don't think so.\n[doctor]  Okay, thank you Abigail and I'd like I said stop out at the desk and we'll make an appointment for two weeks.\n[patient]  Okay thanks doctor.\n[doctor]  Thank you.",

So, how are you doing today?\n[patient]  I don't hear the question, but I'm assuming that you and you say, BATCHER. So when I start talking about my dog and my three cats, and all that those sort of things are not going to be included in the note.\n[doctor]  Right, I want you, you can talk about those things, yes.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Okay, so with your newly diagnosed ovarian cancer, so how are you feeling today? How are you doing?\n[patient]  I'm doing pretty good to press.\n[doctor]  Little depressed, I can understand it's a lot to take on, isn't it?\n[patient]  Yes.\n[doctor]  Okay, okay, so let me ask you some questions. So what kind of symptoms were you having that prompted your doctor to do the tests?\n[patient]  I was having severe pain and bleeding.\n[doctor]  Okay, now do you have other symptoms such as weight loss constipation vomiting or issues with your nation?\n[patient]  no vomiting but constipation and weight loss.\n[doctor]  Okay, yeah, that's understandable. So do you have any children or have you ever been pregnant?\n[patient]  I'm sorry I didn't hear that part.\n[doctor]  Do you have any children or have you ever been pregnant?\n[patient]  Note it either one of those.\n[doctor]  Okay, so, and do you know at what age you got your period and when you started menopause?\n[patient]  13 from my period in 28th from Menopause.\n[doctor]  Okay, do you take any oral hormone replacement therapy?\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  Okay, any history of endometriosis?\n[patient]  Any history of what?\n[doctor]  endometriosis.\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  Okay, how about any family history of any gynecological cancers?\n[patient]  I was adopted.\n[doctor]  Okay, okay. So I'm just going to do a quick exam of your abdomen and then perform a vaginal exam, okay.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Alright, okay, so I do feel the mass on the where to go here, okay.\n[patient]  I didn't know you were going to play a doctor today.\n[doctor]  I did okay, okay, so I do feel the mass on the left side, but everything else looks good. And on abdominal exam, there is slight tenderness to palpation of the left lower quadrant, no rebounding, or guarding on vaginal exam. There are no external lesions on the labia, the vaginal vault, is within normal limits the cervix is pink without lesions. And on bimanural exam, I appreciate a left adnexal mass. And there is no masses. On the right, okay, so now I reviewed the results of your abdominal CT, which show a. Three centimeter left ovarian mass with an associated local localized lymph node involvement, there is no evidence of gross peritoneal or metastatic disease. So let me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan. So for the first problem, so I do think this is most likely a variant cancer looking at your CT scan. It looks like stage three a disease based on the lymph node involvement. I want to start by sending off some blood tests like a CA 125 and HCG and AFP and LDH, these are just tests that help me to determine what type of tumor I'm dealing with. And then I want you to undergo genetic counseling and testing to see if you have a genetic predisposition for developing ovarian cancer. So this stage of ovarian cancer is treated by performing surgery followed by adjunct chemotherapy. So this means we'll start chemotherapy after you've recovered from surgery. Okay, so for the surgery, I would perform a hysterectomy remove both ovaries and perform a lymph node dissection to remove the involved and involve lymph nodes as well as any other ones I see. And I'll also send a sample of any tissue if there anything that looks suspicious at all. And we'll be able to tell exactly what stage this is based on the pathology reports I then recommend chemotherapy with cisplatin and taxol. And based on how the surgery goes, I may want you to receive intreparentenial intreparentenial chemo, which is done inserting a small tube into. You're belly for the chemo to go directly into your peritoneum. Now I know. That was a lot sick and you have any questions or...\n[patient]  Am I gonna die?\n[doctor]  Well, that's a good question. So based on what I see at this time, I will we believe you have a favorable diagnosis prognosis, and you're also still young and healthy, which makes your prognosis even better. And we do need to see a final pathology report to give you a definitive answer, though, okay?\n[patient]  Alright, alright.",

What's been going on the medical assistant told me that you're having some difficulty urinating?\n[patient]  Yeah, yeah, I didn't really want to come and talk about it's kind of weird, but I think probably over the last six months I'm just not peeing right it just doesn't seem to be normal\n[doctor]  Okay, so let's talk a little bit about that now is your is your stream is your urination stream week?\n[patient]  Yeah, I'd probably say so.\n[doctor]  Okay, and do you feel like you're emptying your bladder fully? Or do you feel like you still have some urine left in there when you when you finish?\n[patient]  Most of the times I'm okay, but sometimes if I stand there long enough, I can kind of go a little bit more. So it's taking a while actually to just go to the bathroom.\n[doctor]  Okay, and are you waking up at night to go to the bathroom? Does it impact your sleep?\n[patient]  Yeah, I try to empty my bladder now right before I go to bed and not drink anything, but I'm still probably getting up three or four times a night to go to the bed.\n[doctor]  Okay, so you're getting up about three or four times a night and how long has this been going on you said for about six months?\n[patient]  Yes, six months to like this and it's probably been a little bit worse over the last six months and maybe it's been longer I just didn't want to bring it up\n[doctor]  Okay, so you think it's been going on longer? Okay. All right, now how about have you had any burning when you urinate at all?\n[patient]  No, I don't think it burns.\n[doctor]  No burning when you urinate okay and any other issues, any problems with your bowels, any constipation issues.\n[patient]  No, I had diarrhea last week, but I think I ate something bad.\n[doctor]  Okay, and ever have you ever had any issues where you had what we call urinary retention where you couldn't pee and you needed to have like a catheter inserted?\n[patient]  My gosh, no.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  I'll do that.\n[doctor]  All right, and have you ever seen a urologist I don't think so you've been my patient for a while I don't remember ever sending you, but have you ever seen one?\n[patient]  I don't think so.\n[doctor]  Okay, now tell me how are you doing with your heart when was the last time you saw Dr. Morthic cardiologist? I know that you had the stent placed in your right coronary artery about what was that 2018.\n[patient]  Yes, sounds about right I think I just saw him in November. He said everything was okay.\n[doctor]  He said everything was okay. All right. And so you haven't had any chest pain or shortness of breath. You're still walking around doing your activities of daily living. Are you exercising?\n[patient]  kind of\n[doctor]  Kind of okay now from what I remember I remember you being a big college football fan are you as excited as I and that Georgia beat Alabama in the national championships.\n[patient]  He am super excited.\n[doctor]  You don't really seem that excited.\n[patient]  Get the problem fixed because I have to be able to sit there and watch the whole game.\n[doctor]  Yeah, I really don't like Nick saving. I'm so I'm super happy that the dogs pulled it out.\n[patient]  I don't know if we can do friends anymore.\n[doctor]  Are you in Alabama fan?\n[patient]  Maybe I'm actually originally not from Georgia so.\n[doctor]  Okay alright while I'm in I am I'm a long horns fan. But anyway while I digress let's talk a little bit about your diet be these how are you doing with your sugars are you watching your diet.\n[patient]  I'm trying to, yeah, I think they are okay.\n[doctor]  Okay, and are you still taking the metformin?\n[patient]  Yep.\n[doctor]  You are okay. Alright now, I want to go ahead and just move on to a quick physical exam. Okay, I'm going to be calling out some of my exam findings and I'm going to let you know what that means when I'm done. Okay, alright, I do have to do a rectal exam. I apologize. I'm just going to be calling it out. What would I appreciate? Okay, so on your heart exam, I do appreciate a slight three out of six systolic ejection murmur hurt at the left base. On your lung, exam, your lungs are clear to osculation bilaterally on. Your abdominal exam, your abdomen is nontender and nondestended. I don't appreciate any masses or any rebound or guarding on your prostate exam. I do appreciate an enlarged prostate. I don't appreciate any masses on physical exam. So what, what does that mean? Billy? So that ultimately means that you know everything looks good. You know you have that little heart murmur, which I believe you've had in the past, but we're going to go ahead and look into that. You know your prostate seems a little bit enlarged to me on physical exam. So let's talk about how we can go about and remedy that. Okay, so for your first problem of this, you know, difficulty urinating, I want to go ahead and just order some routine labs. I want to get a PSA that kind of that ultimately kind of looks for prostate cancer issues, which I don't think you have because we didn't really appreciate that on physical exam. I want to go ahead and we can try to start you on what we call flow max 0.4 milligrams once a day. You should take it at night because it can cause people to get a little bit dizzy if they take it in the morning. So I would take it at night and I want to go ahead and refer you to a urologist just to look into this more. So we can go ahead and then get this problem solved for you. Okay, I'm also going to go ahead and just order some routine blood tests just to make sure that we are not missing anything. Do you have any questions about that? And I want to go ahead and order a urinalysis and a urine culture.\n[patient]  Yeah, so sounds good have you seen that commercial for that super-batter-pros state stuff does that work?\n[doctor]  Well, I think the data, it's it's I'm not really sure if it works or not I'm not that familiar with it. Let's just go ahead and stick with FlowMax and that's why we are going to refer you to the urologist so that they can go ahead and talk to you about you know the most current treatment options for you. Okay.\n[patient]  All right.\n[doctor]  All right, for your second problem of your coronary artery disease, I want to go ahead and order an echocardiogram just to follow up on that heart murmur that you had. And I want to go ahead and continue you on the lipitor 40 milligrams a day and the aspirin and the metaprolol. And I want to go ahead and order a lipid panel any questions about that.\n[patient]  Nope.\n[doctor]  Okay, and then for your third problem of your diabetes, it sounds like you're doing really. Well, let's go ahead and continue you on the metformin 1000 milligrams twice a day. We will go ahead and order a hemoglobin A1C to see if we need to make any adjustments to that. And I'm going to see you again in about three to four weeks. Okay, I want you to call me or message me in the patient portal if you have any concerns.\n[patient]  Alright, when is the urologist gonna call me?\n[doctor]  I'm going to reach out to them now and see if they can get you in this week.\n[patient]  Sounds good.\n[doctor]  Okay alright well, great it was good to see you bye.\n[doctor]  I could just hit it and I can just talk and then I'm just",

Could you tell me what happened?\n[patient]  Yeah, while I was playing tennis, and I was trying to know volleyball.\n[doctor]  Hmm.\n[patient]  It was like a double game and I was trying to volley the ball. And I got in front of another player and actually ended up falling on top of my foot.\n[doctor]  Alright.\n[patient]  And then yet kind of hurt, I quickly then twisted myself around her because I was trying to catch myself, but then I started to feel some pain in my foot.\n[doctor]  Bum! Okay, have you ever injured that foot before?\n[patient]  You know, sorry I injured my other foot before not this foot.\n[doctor]  Okay, so right now you're experiencing right leg pain, but you have injured your left leg before. Is that what I'm hearing?\n[patient]  Yeah, that's fine.\n[doctor]  Alright, were you able to continue playing?\n[patient]  No, I had to stop. I actually was like I had to be held from a field because I couldn't put weight on my foot.\n[doctor]  I'm sorry, okay. So what have you been doing for the pain since then?\n[patient]  I wrapped it after the game. They had some ace wraps in their clubhouse. And so I wrapped it up and then I iced it last night. And I just kept it up on a pillow. And then I took some ibuprofen.\n[doctor]  Okay, could you one more time when did this injury happen?\n[patient]  This happened about a couple days ago.\n[doctor]  Okay, so did you say whether does the ibuprofen help at all?\n[patient]  Yeah, it helps a little bit, but then you know it, you know after a while it wears out.\n[doctor]  Okay, and then have you experienced any numbness or tingling?\n[patient]  No, no, no, miss.\n[doctor]  Okay, alright, any loss in sensation.\n[patient]  No, I mean I can still feel like I can still feel my foot.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right, that's good to hear. So you were playing tennis, is that what you normally do to work out?\n[patient]  I don't try to learn, but I cannot afford tennis lessons. So me and my friends just hit the balls back and forth I do sleep.\n[doctor]  I love it absolutely, yeah my dad, one time took me to play a racket ball, and I learned the very bruisey way that that wasn't for me, yeah.\n[patient]  That scares me.\n[doctor]  It's a day they move pretty fast, I'm not gonna lie alright so. If you don't mind I'm gonna go ahead and do my my physical exam. I'm gonna be calling out some of my findings but if you have any questions go ahead stop me let me know but I will be explaining along the way okay.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Alright, so I've looked at your vitals and honestly they look great. You know your blood pressure. I see is 125 over 70. That's almost textbook respiratory rate. We are seeing you at a smooth 18. Excuse me, your temperature. You're running normal 97. One you're sadding at 100%. And then your pulse. So that's interesting like you're going at like about 60 beats a minute. So I think they're, I think we're doing pretty well. I'm going to go ahead and listen to your heart on your heart exam. I don't appreciate any like murmur rub or gallop. We have a nice regular rate and rhythm for your lung exam. I do appreciate a little bit of strider that's really interesting, but I don't. Here any weases or rals so that's great for. Here I know this sounds weird, but for your abdominal exam I don't appreciate any rebound no guarding on your skin exam. I don't sorry like on your head everything looks symmetrical your mucosal membranes are normal. You don't feel hot to touch. So that's great, but I'm going to do my foot exam. Okay, so on the right foot there is some bruising of the plantar and dorsal aspects of the foot there is associated swelling when I touch on. Your mid foot here does it hurt.\n[patient]  Noah\n[doctor]  Okay, all right, tenderness to palpation of the midfoot and positive piano key test of the first and second metatarsals. All right, it's also warm to touch. All right, so on your neurovascular exam of your right foot, your capillary refill is less than three seconds strong dorsalis pedispulse. And your sensation is intact to light touch your left foot exam is normal capillary refill, is appropriate petal pulses are strong. And sensation is intact, so I know that before here we before, I came in that we got an X. Ray, so I've reviewed the results of your X-ray of your right foot and it showed subtle dorsal displacement of the base of the second metatarsal with a three millimeter separation of the first and second metatarsal bases. And the presence of a bony fragment in the Liz Frank joint space. All right, I know those were a bunch of fancy words, so now I'm going to explain to you what that all means for my impression and plan your first problem is right. Foot pain consistent with a Liz Frank fracture, which is A. Fracture to one of your second metatarsal bones near the top of your foot, right? So the big part of your toe is the first metatarsal the second part where you can kind of like bend it right. That's the that's the metatarsal that we're talking about based on your exam. And what I'm seeing on your X-ray, I am going to recommend surgery for your foot the surgery will help place the bones in their proper positions using plates and screws to help. Prevent further complications. There are also many ligaments at the top of your foot. So I will be ordering an MRI to further assess the fracture and any injury to the ligaments I know this is a lot you have any questions.\n[patient]  Yet do I have to do the surgery?\n[doctor]  So I'm recommending it as there can be significant complications to your foot. If you don't, it can lead to poor bone alignment or poor ligament healing, which can lead to you losing the arch of your foot and becoming flatfooted. You can also develop arthritis in that foot. So yes, I, I highly recommend it if you want to be able to walk and move about in a way that you are familiar with.\n[patient]  I just hate that word surgery doc.\n[doctor]  I know.\n[patient]  You know, it scares me every time, I mean especially with my foot, I want to be able to walk again. And so, I just get really worried I mean how long is the procedure usually, too.\n[doctor]  So it's actually...\n[patient]  have to be in the hospital.\n[doctor]  No, no, no, no, no, it's actually a day surgery, and you'll be able to go home the same day. And then you will follow up with me here in the clinic in about a week, you'll be in a cast, and you will use crutches as you will not be able to use that foot for six to eight weeks after that you'll start gradually walking on your foot based on how you do. So the procedure itself is not very long you will, and so like since you'll be able to go home, that's great. But you won't be able to drive especially since. You're saying are you left-handed or right-handed?\n[patient]  I'm right-handed.\n[doctor]  Yes, so your your right foot is probably your dominant one and the also the one you're supposed to drive with. So no, you're going to need somebody to take you home, but what?\n[patient]  I mean\n[doctor]  Ah,\n[patient]  Does that mean I'm out for the rest of the season? I mean, I want to be able to get back and play again. I really am. I'm getting a little better. So I...\n[doctor]  Hmm.\n[patient]  I really want to keep on playing my tennis with my friends, but...\n[doctor]  Yes, so unfortunately, yes, it does mean that you're out for the rest of the season, but hopefully we can get you a great get you to a setup well for next season. And in the meantime, I think I'm going to recommend after surgery that we get you to physical therapy, I think that that's going to be a really great way to like kind of strengthen the muscles and make sure that you're at peak performance before we put you back out there.\n[patient]  I suppose so.\n[doctor]  Yeah\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Alright.\n[patient]  Thank you.\n[doctor]  No problem. So I do want to let you know that there are some risks associated with any kind of surgical procedure I'm going to bring you some paperwork and that my mom is going to go over with you such as like risks of bleeding loss of sensation or of damage. All those things will be discussed with you. And if you have any questions leading up to and even after your procedure go ahead and ask them and we'll be more than happy to help with that, okay?\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Alright.\n[patient]  Good.\n[doctor]  Thank you.\n[patient]  Thank you.",
            "tgt": "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nBrittany Edwards is a 76-year-old female, right-hand-dominant, female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right foot pain. The onset of her pain began 2 days ago, when she was playing tennis and was trying to volley the ball when she got in front of another player and fell on the dorsal aspect of her right foot. She states that she quickly twisted her foot because she was trying to catch herself. The patient reports that she was unable to continue playing secondary to the pain. She states that she wrapped her foot after the game and iced it last night. The patient adds that she kept her foot up on a pillow and took ibuprofen for pain. She denies any numbness. The patient denies any loss of sensation.\n\nThe patient has a history of a left leg injury.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nMusculoskeletal: Reports right foot pain.\nNeurological: Denies numbness in the right foot.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nSKIN: Warm\nNEURO: Normal sensation.\nMSK:\nExamination of the right foot: Bruising of the plantar and dorsal aspects of the foot. Associated swelling. Tenderness to palpation of the midfoot. Positive piano key test of the 1st and 2nd metatarsals. Warm to touch. Neurovascular intact distally. Capillary refill is less than 3 seconds. Strong dorsalis pedis pulse.\nExamination of the left foot: Brisk capillary refill to all digits and light touch intact.\n\nRESULTS\n\n3 views of the right foot were taken. These reveal subtle dorsal displacement of the base of the 2nd metatarsal with a 3 mm separation of the 1st and 2nd metatarsal bases. There is the presence of a bony fragment in the Lisfranc joint space.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nRight foot pain, consistent with a Lisfranc fracture.\n\nPLAN\n\nAfter reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to her current symptoms. I have explained to her that her x-rays revealed a Lisfranc fracture. We discussed treatment options for this and I have recommended that we proceed with surgical intervention. The plan is to proceed with a right foot ORIF and all indicated procedures. We went over the risk, benefits, and alternatives of the surgery. The risk include but not limited to continued pain, swelling, damage to surrounding tissue including nerves and blood vessels, numbness that could be permanent, infection, nonunion, malunion, failure of hardware, and need for further surgery. There is always a risk of amputation, heart attack, stroke, blood clots, pulmonary embolism, and death. There is a possibility of chronic pain and the inability to get back to the previous level of function. The patient wishes to proceed with the operation and she will follow up with me on the day of surgery. In the meantime, I have recommended that the patient attend formal physical therapy to strengthen her right foot.\n",

            "src": "[doctor]  Hey Linda, good to see you today. So looking here and my notes looks like you think you have a kidney stone think you've had them before and and you I guess you're having some pain and while we are here I see you I see you have a you have past medical history of hypertension diabetes and we will check up on those as well. So with your kidney stone can you tell me what happened what's going on?\n[patient]  And I've been in a lot of pain it started about, I would say, probably about three days ago.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  started having pain on my left back.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  And since then I continue to have pain is traveling a little lower, it's gone a little low. But I definitely have not passed it yet. And I'm just in so much pain.\n[doctor]  Okay, so is the pain that you're having as it constant or does it come and go?\n[patient]  It's constant.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  all the time I can't get comfortable.\n[doctor]  All right are you able to urinate?\n[patient]  I am and this morning I actually started seeing some blood.\n[doctor]  Okay, yes so and I know you said I see you've had some kidney stones in the past like how many times would you say you've had one of these episodes\n[patient]  I've had it for probably this might be my third time.\n[doctor]  Third time alright.\n[patient]  Yeah, I haven't had one in a while, but yeah, this is my third time.\n[doctor]  Okay, so have you noticed any nausea chill's fever?\n[patient]  No fever, some chills, and I just in so much pain, I can't eat, and I do feel a little nauseous.\n[doctor]  Okay, that sound definitely understandable. So you've been in a lot of pain, so have you tried to take any medications to alleviate the pain?\n[patient]  Yeah, I've been taking Tylenol. I have had to try some ibuprofen. I know you said to be careful with my blood pressure, but I've been trying to do that because I'm just in so much pain and it's not really working.\n[doctor]  Okay, and before what would you how long would you say it took you to pass the other stones or how was that that resolved?\n[patient]  It usually usually about about three, four days to pass it you.\n[doctor]  Right, so this is the looks like this is the third day.\n[patient]  Yeah.\n[doctor]  So we are getting close there.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Yes, so hopefully we can pass it, but we'll definitely, we can take a look at it here in a second. So while you are here, I also wanted to check up on your diabetes and hypertension you have. So I'm looking here at my notes and you're on two. Five of Norbask for your high blood pressure when you came in today, your blood pressure was a little bit high. And I know that's probably because you are in a bunch of pain, so that definitely makes sense. But I think last time we talked a little bit about you getting a blood pressure cuff and taking your blood pressures regularly. So those readings first off, were you able to get the blood pressure cuff.\n[patient]  I was I haven't been great about taking it, but I did get the blood pressure cuff.\n[doctor]  So the time that you did take it and I think that's something we got to work on is you've taken them. I think at least three times a week I would like you to what have those been running.\n[patient]  Like the top numbers, they're usually the 130's. Sometimes I get, I do go into 140's and once it went to like 150.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  And then the bottom number has been between 70 and 80 okay. That I mean, that's not too bad I think. When you were first diagnosed, you were up there in the...\n[doctor]  The 180's, which was really high.\n[patient]  Right?\n[doctor]  So let me talk a little bit also about you trying to lower your salt intake to like like 2300 milligrams a day. So have you been able to do that?\n[patient]  Try my best, but Doc, I really like my French fries.\n[doctor]  Yeah\n[patient]  Like.\n[doctor]  We all like the French fries, you know, but, you know, we also don't like strokes, so we don't want to have a scope and all the all the French fries. So that's something definitely I would like you to work on. And do you think you'd be able to curb that French fry habit or that bad, this bad food habits by yourself? Or do you think you need help?\n[patient]  Yes, some help could be helpful. Okay, yeah. We can definitely get you connected with someone just to help you with your diet. Kind of that's the biggest thing for a lot of my patient is trying to control that diet all right.\n[doctor]  So I also want to take a look here at your diabetes. And last time you came in your A1C was a little bit higher at 7. 3 and you're on 500 of metformin currently. So have you been taking your blood sugars before you eat every day?\n[patient]  I have and those those have been pretty good they are like in the low one hundreds.\n[doctor]  Okay, that's definitely good because when you came and I think we did a glucose test on you couple of months ago and you were around 300 which is pretty up there. So I'm glad that you know those levels are down and have you been taking that metaphor in every day.\n[patient]  I do.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  I do take it.\n[doctor]  That's really good. All right. So let me do a quick physical exam on you just a couple of questions before I take a look at your abdomen and your back talk to take a look at that that kidney stones are having. So I just want to make sure are you having any any chest pain?\n[patient]  No chest pain.\n[doctor]  No chest pain are you having any belly pain?\n[patient]  The back pain is starting to kind of go down into my groin, but I wouldn't say any back pain, I mean abdominal pain.\n[doctor]  No abdominal pain, alright? So let me check here, I'm gonna listen to your heart real quick. And so on your heart exam, I do hear a grade two out of six systolic ejection murmur and that we knew about that already, so not really worried about that. Currently listen to your lungs or lungs are clear bilaterally. I don't hear any crackles or weasers. So let me press here on your abdomen, does that hurt?\n[patient]  Yes.\n[doctor]  Okay I'm going to press here on your back is that painful.\n[patient]  Yes.\n[doctor]  Alright, so on your examination of your abdomen, there is tenderness to palpation of the abdomen, there isn't any rebound or guarding though, and only there is also CVA to nitus on the right on your flank as well, and so it seems to me you know that you do have that kidney stone looks like you do have some inflammation around your kidney, that's what that's that tenderness around your CVA is is telling me so let's go talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so you know. Right now because of your history of having kidney stones you do have a kidney stone, so what we're going to do is first off I'm going to get you some pain medication kind of you're in a ton of pain right now I'm going to prescribe you some oxycodone 5 milligrams you can take that every six to eight hours is needed for pain and so hopefully that can help you feeling better and you can continue to take that Tylenol for any breakthrough pain that you're having I do want to make sure that you're pushing fluids right now because we need to try to push that stone out that you're having just kind of clear your kidneys and that that would definitely help I also want to give you a strainer so you can strain your urine to see if you do actually pass that stone and then I'm going to refer you to urology and we're actually I'm going to have you even if you pass a stone in the next couple of days I want you to go anyway because it seems like you're having recurrent kidney stones and so hopefully they can help do something to to help this from happening in the future for your hypertension I'm going to keep you on that too five norvascular blood pressures look good so I'm not going to make any changes there and then for your diabetes we'll keep you on the 500 metformin and I also want to give you a referral to nutrition to a dietician and they will be able to help you with your diet I know you said you have a few issues so you know they can possibly write a diet for you and if you follow it you know hopefully in the future we can get you off of both of these medications and get you back to normal so how does that all sound\n[patient]  That sounds good, and I just want this pain to go away, so thank you.\n[doctor]  Okay, no problem.",

            "src": "[doctor]  Hey Mason, good to see you today. So let's see you here in my notes for evaluation of kidney stones or your PCP. Said you had some kidney stones, so you got to referral over. So can you tell me a little bit about that, you know, what happened when did you first notice them?\n[patient]  It was about, you know, about a week ago, and I was working down into the bar with the horses and, you know, I was moving some hay. But I developed this real sudden onset of pain in my right back. And I thought it initially, it was from throwing hay, but it I broke out into a sweat, I got real nauseated. And that's when I went and saw my doctor, and he ordered a CAT scan and said that I had a kidney stone, but you know that I've never had that. Before my father's had them in the past, but yes, so. That's how that all happened.\n[doctor]  Okay, so you said you had the pain on the right hand side. Does it move anywhere or radiate?\n[patient]  While when I had it it would it radiated almost down to my groin.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  not the whole way down, but almost to the groin, and since then I haven't had any more pain, and it just been right about there.\n[doctor]  Okay, and is the pain constant or does it come and go?\n[patient]  Well, when I, you know, after I found out I had a disk of kidney stone, it came a couple times, but it didn't last as long no. I've been straining my urine. They told me to pee in this little cup.\n[doctor]  Hmm.\n[patient]  And I've been straining my urine and you know I don't see anything in there.\n[doctor]  Okay, have you noticed any blood in your urine? I know you've been draining, probably take a good look at it has it been darker than usual.\n[patient]  No, not really not really darker.\n[doctor]  Okay, so have you had kidney stones before and then you said your father had them, but...\n[patient]  I've never had a kidney stone my dad had them a lot, but I've never had one.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right, so let me do a quick exam of you. Your vital signs look good. I don't see any fever or your blood pressure and heart rate are fine. So let me do a quick physical exam. Let me press here on your belly. So on your examination of your abdomen, there is no tenderness to depain to palpation of the abdomen. There is no rebound or guarding there as CVA. There is tenderness on the right side. So that means\n[patient]  I have a stroke.\n[doctor]  Can you repeat that?\n[patient]  How did I have a stroke?\n[doctor]  No, no, no, no, no. So that means like everything is normal, right? But I feel like you have some tenderness and inflammation over your kidney. So that has to be expected because you do have a kidney stone. So I did review the results of your CT. And it does show a stone that's measuring 0.5 centimeters located in the proximal right your reader. And that's that duct that classes from your kidney to down to your bladder. There is no evidence of hydronophrosis that would mean that the stone is obstruct obstructing the your reader causing swelling in the kidney. So there is there is no evidence of that. So let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan. So you do have that kidney stone. So right now I'm going to recommend that we we have you push fluids just to help facilitate you urinating and passing the stone. I'm going to prescribe you some oxycodone 5 milligrams every six to eight hours for pain. And you can continue to take Tylenol between that for any breakthrough pain. And you already have a strainer. So that's good. Continue to use that and we can see continue that until the stone haussies. And I'm also going to order a BMP and your urinalysis and urine culture just to make sure that everything else is okay with you. And based on your analysis we can see if we need to prescribe you antibiotics. See if you have any type of infection. I do want to see you back in about one to two weeks. And hopefully by that time you pass the stone. But if not we can discuss further treatment. Lithotrpycy it's like a shock wave kind of breaks up that stone. It's not it's not that invasive procedure. But we can just we can discuss that if it hasn't passed in that one to two weeks that sound good.\n[patient]  That sounds perfect dear to.\n[doctor]  Alright.\n[patient]  Thank you, document.\n[doctor]  So I will see you in a week or so and hopefully you've passed that stone and I'll send my nurse in with that prescription.\n[patient]  Okay, thank you.\n[doctor]  Thanks.",

The patient was referred from his primary care physician. The onset of his pain began 1 week ago when he was in his barn moving hay when he had a sudden onset of right back pain. The patient initially thought his pain was due to throwing hay; however, he broke out into a sweat and became nauseated. He was seen by his primary care physician, who ordered a CT scan and told him that he had a kidney stone. He denies having kidney stones before, but states that his father has a history of kidney stones in the past. He explains that when he had pain, which has now resolved, it would radiate almost to his groin. The patient describes the pain as intermittent after he found out it was a kidney stone.

And it's just yet, it's just not going away. I'm not sure if it maybe even got a little worse from when I first noticed it.\n[doctor]  Okay, and how long did you say it's going on for?\n[patient]  Probably about.\n[doctor]  6-8 weeks maybe.\n[patient]  Okay, and do you have any pain in your foot? No, no, no, pain at all. Okay. Now I know that you're a diabetic and you're on some insulin. Have your sugar's been running. Okay. They have been running.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  You know, in the most part, they seem to be running a little higher than normal.\n[doctor]  Your sugars are running higher than normal. Okay, do you recall what your last hemoglobin A1c was at above 9?\n[patient]  Yes, it definitely was higher than 9.\n[doctor]  Okay, alright now, what do you think caused this ulcer? Were you wearing some tight-fitting shoes? Or did you have some trauma to your foot? Or...\n[patient]  Yeah, I was, you know, I think initially, I mean, I was out in the backyard, you know, kind of, you know, doing some work. And, you know, I know, you know, I could have stepped on a nail or, you know, there was some other work, but you know, I'm always outside. So I don't know if that kind of led to anything or caused anything.\n[doctor]  Okay, alright, and have you had any fever or chills?\n[patient]  No, no, no fever or chills. You know, I kind of get headaches pretty often. I don't know if it, you know, I don't know if it's stress or, but you know, always have like the tension headaches in the front.\n[doctor]  Okay, and do you have, do you have neuropathy where you get like numbing and tingling in your feet?\n[patient]  Occasionally, yeah, occasionally, especially once like colder outside.\n[doctor]  Mm-hmm, kind of feels like it takes a little longer to.\n[patient]  Warm up, but yeah, I kind of have some sensation in all my extremities.\n[doctor]  Okay alright, and then are you a smoker or did you smoke?\n[patient]  I did back, you know, kind of years ago I did, but yeah, I haven't smoked anything in a good number of years.\n[doctor]  Okay, alright when did you stop smoking?\n[patient]  A couple years ago, maybe four or so years ago.\n[doctor]  Okay, alright, and how many packs a day would you smoke?\n[patient]  Gosh back then, yeah was at least two.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right, how many years did you smoke for like 20?\n[patient]  Yeah, at least 20 at 20 plus years.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right now. Any other symptoms do you have any problems when you walk down the street? Do you get any pain in your calves at all when you walk?\n[patient]  No, no, no, no, no, pain. You know, just kind of you know, it's just I know that it's there.\n[doctor]  Okay, and you said you're active you're out in the yard, and things like that you go on long walks at all or no.\n[patient]  No, no, you know, it's, you know, I just kind of feel like I've been just trying to take it easy lately.\n[doctor]  Hmm.\n[patient]  But your most most of the stuff I've been doing is just kind of hanging around the house.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right, so we talked a little bit about your diabetes. Let's talk about your heart disease. Now your heart disease, you had a heart attack in 2018. We put a stent into your right coronary artery. You're still taking your medications for that. You're still on your aspirin.\n[patient]  I am yes, yeah, I do the baby aspirin every day.\n[doctor]  Okay, alright, an NHS pain or shortness of breath or anything like that no-no, you know nothing more than ya, I wouldn't attribute anything.\n[patient]  Okay, and do you have a podiatrist for your yearly foot exams?\n[doctor]  No, I, I, I don't okay. All right, all right. Well, let's go ahead. I want to just do a quick physical exam. I'm just going to be calling out some of my exam findings. So your vital signs here in the office, you don't have any fever. So that's good. Your blood pressure is great. It's like 127 over 80 and your heart rate is nice and slow in the 60s on your neck exam. I don't appreciate any jugular venous distension or any carotid. Brutes on your lung exam, your lungs are clear to osculation. By laterally on your heart exam, you do have a two out of six systolic ejection murmur hurt at the left base and on your lower extremity exam I don't appreciate any palpable dorsalis pedus or posterior tibial pulses there is a two by three centimeter ulcerated lesion on the right lateral foot near the fifth metacarpal metatarsophilangial joint. There is no associated cellulitis. Does it hurt when I press here?\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  There is no pain to palpation of the right foot. There is associated granulation tissue and some slight purulent discharge from the wound, okay. So what does all that mean that just means that you have this ulcer that's fairly sizable with I think we need to do some good wound care on? It lets talk a little bit about my assessment and plan so you know, are you have a non-healing ulcer of your right foot? So we need to do some studies on you to see. If you have an adequate blood supply to heal, this foot wound. And since you, since you probably don't because of your diabetes you're here in a vascular surgeon's office, we may have to go ahead and talk about being able to open up some of your arteries to improve the blood supply to your foot. So that might mean getting a stent to one of your arteries in your legs to open up the blood supply, it might mean that we might have to do some bypass surgery to improve the blood supply to your foot. In order to heal that wound, I do think that you'll be able to heal it. I don't think that we need to do anything drastic. I want you to continue with your aspirin because that will help.\n[patient]  Any questions?\n[doctor]  Yeah, I mean, is this do we have to do any more tests or anything? What are you going to do in arterial ultrasound? I'm going to go ahead and order an arterial ultrasound of your lower extremities to see what the blood supply is like. And then I'm going to go ahead and order a podiatry consult because I want them to see this wound and improve the wound care that you're doing. And then for your next problem, your diabetes, I want to go ahead and talk to your primary care physician.

            "tgt": "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nRight foot ulcer.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nJeremy Roberts is a 79-year-old male who presents today for evaluation of a right foot ulcer. He reports an ulcer on his right foot has been present for approximately 6 to 8 weeks. He first noticed the ulcer after working outside. There is no associated pain, however, he feels the ulcer may have worsened from when he first noticed it. He denies experiencing any fevers or chills. He does however experience tension headaches quite frequently. He denies any pain in his calves when he walks. At this time the patient does not have a podiatrist for yearly foot exams.\n\nHe is a diabetic and takes insulin. His blood sugar has been running higher than normal and his last hemoglobin A1c was higher than 9. Occasionally he will also experience numbness and tingling in his feet, especially with colder weather.\n\nIn terms of his heart disease, the patient sustained a heart attack in 2018 and underwent stent placement at the right coronary artery. He is currently taking aspirin 81 mg daily. He denies chest pain or shortness of breath.\n\nMEDICAL HISTORY\n\nPatient reports history of diabetes and heart disease. He sustained a heart attack in 2018.\n\nSURGICAL HISTORY\n\nPatient reports undergoing stent placement at the right coronary artery.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nPatient reports he is a former smoker. He previously smoked 2 packs a day for 20 years and was able to stop smoking approximately 4 years ago. Currently he is not very active but he does work around the house.\n\nMEDICATIONS\n\nPatient reports taking aspirin 81 mg daily and insulin.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nConstitutional: Denies fevers and chills.\nCardiovascular: Denies chest pain.\nRespiratory: Denies dyspnea.\nSkin: Patient reports right foot ulcer.\nNeurological: Patient reports headaches and numbness and tingling in feet.\n\nVITALS\n\nNo fever.\nBlood pressure: 127/80\nHeart rate: 60s\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nCV: 2/6 systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base.\nRESPIRATORY: Clear to auscultation bilaterally\nNECK: No jugular venous distention or carotid bruits\nMSK: Examination of the right lower extremity: No palpable dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial pulses. There is a 2 x 3 cm ulcerated lesion on the right lateral foot near the 5th metacarpal metatarsophalangeal joint. No associated cellulitis. No pain to palpation of the right foot. There is associated granulation tissue and some slight purulent discharge from the wound.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\n1. Non-healing ulcer, right foot\n2. Diabetes\n3. Coronary artery disease\n\nPLAN\n\nAfter reviewing the patient's examination findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. We discussed that his right foot ulcer is fairly sizable and will require wound care. I advised him that the ulcer does not appear to be healing and that further studies will be needed to assess if he has adequate blood supply to heal his foot wound. He was advised that due to his diabetes it is possible surgical intervention such as stent placement or bypass surgery may be required to improve his blood supply. I also advised him that I believe we will be able to heal his wound. At this time, I have recommended continued wound care and for him to also continue taking aspirin 81 mg daily. We will order an arterial ultrasound of the lower extremities. He will also be referred to podiatry for a consult.\n\nRegarding his diabetes, this appears to be unstable as the patient reports his last hemoglobin a1c was greater than 9 and is now experiencing a non-healing right foot ulcer. We discussed the importance of blood sugar control as this will impact his wound healing. At this time, I have recommended that he follow-up with his primary care physician for further care.\n\nThe patient's coronary artery disease is currently stable. It is recommended that he continue to take his statin as prescribed. I will contact his cardiologist for medical clearance should surgical intervention be required for his non-healing right foot ulcer.",

            "src": "[doctor]  So, Anna, good to see you today. So, reading here in your appointment notes you were diagnosed with kidney stones from your PCP, and you currently have one. And so, they had you come in so can you tell me what happened? How's all that going for you?\n[patient]  Shrubb been having some back pain on my right side. It's been lasting for about a week now.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  And I also started to see some blood in my urine.\n[doctor]  Okay, so on the right side, so does that paint does it move anywhere? Or is it just kind of stay in that that one area?\n[patient]  It's moved down a little bit onto my right lower side a little bit.\n[doctor]  Side okay, so how would you describe the pain? Is it constant or does it come and go?\n[patient]  It's pretty constant.\n[doctor]  Okay, did you notice any pain when you're urinating? I know I know you say you saw you see blood, but any pain with that.\n[patient]  No no real pain when I'm when I'm peeing at all.\n[doctor]  Okay, so have you taken anything I know have you tried like Azo or any of that too?\n[patient]  I took some ibuprofen that helped a little bit.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  but it still hurts even with ibuprofen.\n[doctor]  All right, have you noticed any nausea vomiting fever chills?\n[patient]  I haven't thrown up, but I fell a little bit nauseated.\n[doctor]  Little nauseated. Yeah, that's we expected. So have you do you have a family history of kidney stones? I know some people when they have them like their parents have them stuff, but\n[patient]  Yep, my dad had kidney stones, I think he has passed a couple of them. I'm not quite sure.\n[doctor]  Alright, and have you had any in the past or is this your first one?\n[patient]  This is my first time I've never had this before.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right, so we'll do an exam on you just to check you out. So I guess you were in pain and stuff over the Easter Easter break there that.\n[patient]  Yeah, yeah. I had some pain over the weekend. I saw my pediatrician this morning, so they sent me over here. They were concerned that I might have a kidney stone.\n[doctor]  Okay, so I'm guessing you didn't get to go find the eggs on the Easter egg hunt because of the urine pain.\n[patient]  Not so much, but I got to participate a little bit, I opened some eggs, I just didn't go run around and find them.\n[doctor]  Okay, well I'm lucky enough my friends had an adult Easter hag hunt for me, and so I was able to find a couple eggs yesterday myself. So I'm glad you were able to get a few of them, alright, so let's do that that physical exam on you. So your vitals look good, you don't have any fever, your blood pressure, heart rate is fine, so when I press here on your belly does that hurt.\n[patient]  A little bit, yeah.\n[doctor]  A little bit, all right, so on your exam of your abdomen, there is mild pain and tenderness to palpation of the abdomen. There's no rebound or guarding there a CVA located near your flank tenderness on the right. So that means that everything looks good, but you do have what seems to be some inflammation of your kidney okay. So we were able to get a CT of your side, and it showed that you do have a stone measuring 0.5 centimeters in size, and it's located in the proximal right-your-reader. And so that's that duck that passes from your kidney to your bladder. All right, I don't see any evidence of hydronophrosis. So that means that there's not obstructing your reader causing swelling in your kidney, which is which is pretty good. So let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan so you do have that kidney stone on the right. So what I'm recommending is I want you to push fluids just to help facilitate you passing that stone all right, have you? Been taking in, have you been drinking enough water? Do you think so far?\n[patient]  Probably not enough I drink some but.\n[doctor]  Okay, yeah, I want you to drink, try, drink as much as possible just to see if we can get you hydrated and pass the stone what I'm going to do is I'm going to prescribe you ibuprofen 800 milligrams. You can take that as needed for pain. I know you said you were in that much pain. Just in case it does start to move your in pain, I want you to take the ibuprofen. I'm also going to give you a strainer for you to strain your pee so we can see. You want to know when that that stone does pass going to order. A BMP and a urinalysis and a urine culture and based on what the urinalysis shows we can decide. If I can decide, if I need to put you on antibiotics, if you do have an infection of some kind, and I want to see you back in about a week to two weeks, and if you're still having symptoms, we can discuss further treatment such as a lithotrypsy and it's a mainly minimally invasive procedure where we use shock waves to try to break up. That's stone, but otherwise do you have any other questions for me?\n[patient]  know what i think so\n[doctor]  Alright, so we will see you back in a week or two and I'll have my nurse come in with that prescription and hopefully with all the treatment you'll be able to pass the stone, okay? Alright.",

Her primary care physician was concerned for possible kidney stones and subsequently referred her here for further evaluation. She denies any pain with urination or vomiting, but admits that she has likely not been drinking enough water. The only treatment she has tried so far is ibuprofen with minimal pain relief. Although she denies any personal history of kidney stones prior to this occurrence, she explains that her father has had kidney stones in the past.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nConstitutional: Negative for fever.\nGastrointestinal: Positive for nausea.

Given that over-the-counter ibuprofen is not providing significant relief, we will send in a prescription for ibuprofen 800 mg to help with her pain. I'm also going to order a BMP, urinalysis, and a urine culture for further evaluation. Depending on the results of the urinalysis, we may need to start her on antibiotics. I want to see her back in 2 weeks. If she is still symptomatic at that time, we may need to consider further treatment such as a lithotripsy.

You know something I've been suffering with for so long now. It's still quite itchy and it's really embarrassing too because I'll have dandruff so much like all over me. But I just can't stop itching.\n[doctor]  Okay, when did you first notice this?\n[patient]  I want to say it's been a while, but probably worsening in the past like six months or so.\n[doctor]  Okay, okay. And have you seen ever noticed any rashes either when it first started or intermittently anywhere else?\n[patient]  Well my body know not really.\n[doctor]  Okay, okay, just mainly up underneath you're on your scalp there. Uh, and I can see that man that looks really itchy and scaly have you dyed your hair recently, or used any other chemicals, you know, like a new hair spray or gel.\n[patient]  Nothing new, I mean I do dye my hair, but I've been doing that for years now, but otherwise I don't really use a lot of products in my hair.\n[doctor]  Yeah, I know it's funny you say that because I keep saying I earned this gray hair and I'm going to keep it. So you have you tried any over the counter treatments I know there is a lot out of there something you know like a T gel or any of those other have those helped.\n[patient]  Yeah, I did that I did head and shoulders. I even tried some castor oil and but none of them really seem to be helping.\n[doctor]  Okay, okay, let's talk about some other symptoms any joint pain fever weight loss.\n[patient]  Not that I can recall, I've been pretty good otherwise.\n[doctor]  Okay, good. And going back, you know, to your grandparents has anybody else in the family had similar symptoms that you're aware of.\n[patient]  No, well, maybe my sister.\n[doctor]  Maybe your sister okay.\n[patient]  Yeah, maybe my sister, I mean I know she'll as no one has as bad as I do, but she does report like just having a dry scout.\n[doctor]  Okay, okay. Now, you know, a lot of times we can see this with, you know, high levels of stress has there been any new mental or emotional stressors at work or at home?\n[patient]  Not really, I mean it's basically the same things.\n[doctor]  Okay, yeah, IA, we have a lot of that, yes. So let me go ahead and then look at this a little closer here. The first off, I want to tell you the vital signs that the my assistant took when you came in your blood pressure is 130 over 68. Your heart rate was 98 and your respiratory rate was 18. So those all look good and appear normal and your temperature was 97. Seven, and that is all normal now. When I look at your scalp here, I do notice that you have demarcated, scaly, arithematous plaques. And that's just kind of explaining technically what's going on those patches. And they're there in a patchy format. They're diffusely present across the back of your skull. And that's probably why you see all that, that white dander you know on your, on your clothes as you go through the day. Now let me talk a little bit about my impression and plan, I think that you have a scalp psoriasis. And let's in here is my thoughts on that what I would like you to use is to use chlobetisol that's a zero, zero five percent solution. And I want you to use that twice daily on the affected areas of your scalp. So you're just going to put this on and just kind of gently rub it. And now I know to do it twice daily is going to be difficult. But if you can do it first thing in the morning when you get up and then before you go to bed, you know, get a shower. And before you go to bed that will be great. I want you to continue to use T gel shampoo that you listed when you first came in. That's a very good solution. Shampoo for that. And that will help with controlling a lot of this now. There is no cure for this. Unfortunately, and flare ups can be unpredictable. But we see that you know not we don't have a great finger on what causes the flare ups. But I'm going to give you some steroids that will help. And we're going to have to manage that on an ongoing basis. But when you get to get a flare up, I want you to be using these flare steroid that I give you as we go through that. And then I want to see you back here in three months or sooner if it gets significantly worse. Do you have any questions for me?\n[patient]  No, okay. So I'll just use that steroid solution and then just as needed if it's really bad, but then otherwise just use the T gel.\n[doctor]  Yeah, I want it's exactly what I want you to do. I want you to use that that solution twice daily when you get that flare. But then other than that just continue to use that T gel shampoo.\n[patient]  All right.\n[doctor]  Okay, I'm gonna have my nurse come in and get you discharged, but either we will see you again in three months or and again, please if it gets worse, please don't hesitate to call me and come in sooner.\n[patient]  All right, perfect, thank you.\n[doctor]  Thank you.\n[patient]  Okay, bye.",

Can what so what's going on with your right foot today?\n[patient]  It's a little sore today, but you know I hurt my foot before, but this is the first time where I'm actually being seen for it.\n[doctor]  Okay, so you saved injured your right foot before. Tell me a little bit about that injury.\n[patient]  20 years ago, I broke my ankle, I had to put in a cast, but that seems to be okay, but you know sometimes it'll give me trouble once in a while it feels a little sore it swells up at times.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  And my other ankle too is sore sometimes, and I've had surgery for that too, and you know one of those things where you know it might give out once in a while. But I'm not sure that's related to what the you know break dropping on my foot, but you know either way my foot's a little sore.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right, so when you drop that brick on your foot, where you able to get up and keep working, or did you have to get off your, you know, not stop weight bearing, and get off that foot, can you tell me a little bit about after the traumatic incident?\n[patient]  You know, it was a little sore. I called a few names. You know, God damn, why is this in my foot? But you know, I kept working putting around a little bit, but now it's got swollen. So I got to see my doctor. He told me I had to go see you here. I'm so tell me what's going on with it.\n[doctor]  So, what have you been doing for the pain since the initial insult?\n[patient]  Looking it up.\n[doctor]  Okay, have you taken any medication safe, for example Tylenol or ibuprofen for the pain?\n[patient]  No, I feel like taking the medicine.\n[doctor]  Okay, and then just out of curiosity you said you were doing some landscaping have you been over to landscapes where house new here and tell my wife and I were just over there this last weekend and picked up a whole bunch of stuff you had a chance to make it over there yet.\n[patient]  No, not yet I heard about it, though I might have to make a trip once my foot heals.\n[doctor]  Alright, that sounds good. Now just out of curiosity, can you rate your pain for me right now? Zero being none-ten being the worst pain you've ever been in your life?\n[patient]  11 out of 10.\n[doctor]  Okay, and then have you experienced any numbness or tingling of that foot since the incident?\n[patient]  Yeah, the whole foot is numb.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  but been now for a long time.\n[doctor]  Okay, I'm going to do a quick physical exam. Now your vitals look good. And I would like to do a focused exam of your right foot that there is some bruising on the bottom part of your foot and on the top part as well. And I do appreciate the associated swelling. And I also recognize that you do have tenderness to palpation for midfoot now for your neurovascular exam of your right foot, your capillary refill is brisk and less than three. Seconds, I do note a strong bounding dorsalis pedispulse with motor. And sensation is intact for that foot. I also like to call out the fact that it matches bilaterally, which is important I'm going to go ahead and review the diagnostic imaging results. So we did an x-ray of that right foot. And I do notice dorsal displacement of the base of the second metatarsal with a three millimeter separation of the first and second metatarsal bases and presence of bony fragments. So let me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan. Now your right foot pain is due to a lyss frank fracture, which is a fracture to your second metatarsal bone. And the top of your foot this is where the metatarsals meet those cuboids. Okay, so it were the bones come together in your foot now. There are a lot of ligaments in your foot. So I do want to order an MRI just to assess if there is any injuries to those ligaments now based on your exam and looking at the x-ray your most likely going to need surgery. Now the reason why this is important is if we have poor bone alignment or ligament healing, you can this can lead to losing the arch in your foot, you could be coming flat footed and also developing arthritis. Now what's going to be key here is the surgery is going to allow those bones and ligaments to heal properly. We are going to put them back into place using plates and screws. Now the key thing is going to be it's going to be outpatient surgery. So it's going to be same day. I'll see you in the morning and then you'll be discharged home that evening and we will do a follow up. I want to see you in 24 hours post procedure, but then I'll see you again in two weeks. You're going to be in a cast and I'm going to have you use crutches. You're not going to be able to wait bear on that foot for six to eight weeks. What we'll do is we'll advance your ambulating gradually based on how you heal and based on how you tolerate the procedure. I know I have covered a lot of material quickly, but this is really going to be the best course of action for you to have a good outcome. Now do you have any questions come answers concerns before I have the nurse come and finish the paperwork and get you set up for your procedure, which we are going to do tomorrow if you're agreeable to that.\n[patient]  What about putting in a cast? Can I just stay in the cast?\n[doctor]  You could but what we found is the best outcome is aligning those bones with plates and screws to make sure that they heal properly, so you have the best outcome possible.\n[patient]  So if the surgery is going to be tomorrow, what am I going to get my MRI?\n[doctor]  So what we will do is the good news is we have an outpatient MRI facility downstairs and I'm going to send the order down and we'll get you your MRI this afternoon.\n[patient]  Can I think about it? And we have some time.\n[doctor]  Sure.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Alright, thanks Elijah.",

And then so tell me when the twitch occurs, do you ever notice any, you know, parts of her like moving or twitching?\n[patient]  Well, no, it's just her face.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  I mean the whole side of her face moves when it happens. It seems like it's several seconds and then it finally stops and she just seems to be blinking frequently and and then you know wait a minute I did make a video so you can see just in case it doesn't do it during the visit.\n[doctor]  Okay, okay, yeah that would be great to see that because I want to see what's going on so thank you for that tell me is there any family history of seizures or like Tourette syndrome.\n[patient]  Well, no history of seizures, but I never heard of that Tourette thing.\n[doctor]  Yes, so so torrid is that it's a nervous system disorder that you know involves like repetitive movements or like unwanted sounds and it typically begins in childhood and I don't know have you noticed anything like that with her when she was younger.\n[patient]  Really, I had nobody in our family got anything like that.\n[doctor]  Okay, now tell me have you noticed any other symptoms how about like fever or chills?\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  Okay, coughing headache.\n[patient]  Man.\n[doctor]  Okay, how about any problems with care and sleep?\n[patient]  Nope.\n[doctor]  Okay, okay, good, let's go ahead and do physical exam on Karen here. All right, Karen, I'm just going to take a look at you and ask you to follow some commands, okay?\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Alright, can you follow my finger with your eyes good now? Can you do me a favor walk across the room for me? Great job. Okay. Now I want you to close your eyes and reach out your arms in front of you good now. Keep your eyes closed. Can you feel me touch you here? How about okay? How about there?\n[patient]  MM\n[doctor]  Does that feel the same?\n[patient]  Yeah.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right, so I'm just going to check your reflexes. Okay, all right, now when you're on the neurological exam, the patient is awake alert, and oriented times three speech is clear and flu and gate is steady heel toe walking is normal, and the cranial nerves are intact. Without focal neurologic findings, there is no pronator drift sensation. As intact reflexes are two plus and symmetric at the biceps, triceps, knees, and ankles. So this means everything looks good, Karen.\n[patient]  That's great!\n[doctor]  Good alright, so I'm gonna go ahead and tell you what we're gonna do, so I'm gonna tell you my assessment and plan here so dad. So for the first problem, I do believe that Karen does have a tick-eye ticks or very common in children, and as many as you know one in five children have a tick during their school years, and ticks can also include things like shoulder shrugging facial grimacing, sniffling, excessive throat clearing, and uncontrolled vocalization eye. Can say that essentially they're brief sudden. And in voluntary motor movements, now we don't have a full understanding of the cause of the ticks, but they typically occur around five to ten years of age, but most ticks go away on their own, and they disappear within a year. So these are what we call transient ticks, and the best thing to do is ignore the ticks, so it doesn't seem to be bothering Karen, and she seems to be doing well in school and activities. So it may wax and wane over time, but you might notice it more towards the end of the day when the child is tired, so you may also you know see it if they're stressed. So that's why it's important to just ignore it now when you draw attention to the tick, it does make the child conscious, so that can make the tick worse. So we want to be careful again, just to kind of not to draw too much attention on it. And do you have any questions for me?\n[patient]  So you mean you're telling me you don't think you had a seizure or a bit or nothing?\n[doctor]  Yeah, I don't think it's I don't think so because it is the same part of her body that's moving every time that and she reports that it's somewhat of an there is an urge to blink her eye and some relief afterwards.\n[patient]  So you're not recommending any kind of treatment. There is no pill or cream or nothing.\n[doctor]  Not at this time because she seems to be doing well overall, and the tick hasn't impacted her school or her activities. But if it worsens then we can consider some treatment okay.\n[patient]  Alright, alright, sounds good.\n[doctor]  Alright, thank you guys, have a good day!\n[patient]  Doctor.\n[doctor]  By Karen.",

            "src": "[patient]  Alright, thanks for coming in today. I see on my chart here that you had a bunch of lower respiratory infections. So first tell me how are you what's going on.\n[doctor]  You know I'm doing better now, but you know last week I was really sick and I just have had enough like I was coughing a lot, a lot of mucus even had some shortness of breath and even a low grade fever.\n[patient]  Wow, that is a lot. So what did you do for some of those symptoms?\n[doctor]  You know I ended up drinking a lot of fluid and taking some robotusin and I actually got better over the weekend. And now I'm feeling much better but what concerns me is that I tend to get pneumonia a lot.\n[patient]  Okay, so when you say a lot like how frequently does it occur, I would say it seems honestly, it seems like it's every month or every other month, especially over the past six, six months that I just keep getting sick and I usually will end up having to go to my primary care doctor or...\n[doctor]  urgent care, and I'll get prescribed some antibiotics, and one time I actually ended up in the emergency room.\n[patient]  Wow, and how long do your symptoms normally last for?\n[doctor]  You know it could be as few as like a couple of days, but sometimes it could go even up to a week.\n[patient]  In Memhem, you mentioned that you were a farmer. Did you notice that your symptoms occur while doing certain things on the farm?\n[doctor]  You know I was trying to think about that and I've been working on the farm for some time. But the only thing I can think about is that I've been helping my brother out and I've been started like unloading a lot of hay which I don't usually do and I want to say that my symptoms actually start the days that I'm unloading hay.\n[patient]  Alright, do you wear a mask when you're unloading hay?\n[doctor]  No, I don't do that.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  None of us do.\n[patient]  Okay, yeah. So like that your brother doesn't either.\n[doctor]  No, I'm the only one who seems to be getting sick.\n[patient]  Alright, so I know you said you were trying to like help out your brother like what's going on with him.\n[doctor]  You know, we've just been getting really busy and so he has been working around doing other things, so I've just been helping him just cover the extra load.\n[patient]  m-okay alright do you have any other siblings\n[doctor]  Yeah, there is actually ten of us.\n[patient]  Wow, okay, that's a lot of siblings.\n[doctor]  Yeah, I'm okay.\n[patient]  Maybe we could always stick them and they could get some work down the holidays must be fun at your place.\n[doctor]  Yeah, we don't need to hire anyone else to have anyone else this is our family.\n[patient]  You're right, keep in the family. Okay. So speaking of family, do you have, do you, or anyone have a history of seasonal allergies?\n[doctor]  No, no, I have never had any problems with allergies.\n[patient]  Okay, and you smoke.\n[doctor]  I don't smoke.\n[patient]  Do you live with anybody who does?\n[doctor]  I do not.\n[patient]  Okay, all right, so okay. So now I want to go ahead and do my physical exam. I'm going to call out some of my findings just to make sure that I'm documenting everything. And if you have any questions about what it is that I'm saying, please feel free to ask, okay?\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  So I reviewed your vitals and you appear to be breathing a little faster respiratory rate is 20, but your oxygen is your satin kind of fine at 99% on room air. So I'm not too worried about that on for on your heart exam. I do you have a regular rate and regular rhythm. I do not appreciate any murmurs, rubs or gallops on your lung exam. You know, I do you do have some fine rals on your lung exam, but no, weasers and on your musculoskeletal exam, I do not appreciate any clubbing of your fingers. So for your results, I did review the results of your chest x-ray and I noticed some round glass opacities. So let me tell you a little bit about like my assessment and plan for your first problem of recurrent lung infections, your symptoms seem consistent with the condition we call hypersensitivity numinitis in your case. Another name is farmers lung, which you know is appropriate considering your job. This could be caused by bacteria and or mold that is found in the when you inhale it leads to an allergic reaction in your lungs. This is why your symptoms occur every time you move hay for your current symptoms, I'm going to prescribe you a a course of an oral steroid. This will help to decrease the inflammation that is occurring in your lungs. I will also be ordering a cat scan in your lungs, which will help confirm the diagnosis as well. Opulmonary function test to assess how severe your respiratory impairment is it would be best if you could eliminate your exposure to the hay or prevent further to prevent further damage to your lungs, however, if you are unable, it's very important that you wear a respirator when moving hay around. I know that that was a lot of information. I think it boils down to pull in more of your siblings to help work around, but do you have any questions?\n[doctor]  Yes, so is this gonna help so I don't keep getting sick.\n[patient]  So ideally what we are doing, I think this is the best course of action to deal with a deeper problem right of these infections. And to kind of like clear up the pneumonia, everything seems to hint on. So what we're going to do is treat your current infection. We're going to either prevent you from being around hay or make it so that it's safe for you to be with hay. And then we're going to see what we need to do moving forward does that help.\n[doctor]  Okay, it does.\n[patient]  All right.\n[doctor]  Thank you.\n[patient]  Okay, no problem.\n[doctor]  Alright.",

I just had to stand there and it really hurt the whole time I was there\n[patient]  Okay, does it throb, ache burn, what kind of pain do you get with it?\n[doctor]  It's almost like a throbbing pain, but occasionally it becomes almost like a sharp stabbing pain, especially if I move it or spend too much time walking I find myself walking on my heel just to keep that toe from bending.\n[patient]  Okay, sorry I got a text and...\n[doctor]  Well, that's okay, you know what I, you know what I really, you know I love to ride bikes, have you ride bike at all?\n[patient]  No, I hate riding a bike. I'm more a runner.\n[doctor]  My gosh, I love to ride. I ride the lot of rails, the trails. I mean, I go all the last year. I put in over 800 miles on rails, the trails.\n[patient]  Yeah, those are nice.\n[doctor]  Yeah\n[patient]  Does it does riding your bike bother your big toe?\n[doctor]  No, because I kind of pedal with the back of my feet, you know on that side.\n[patient]  Okay, do you wear clips or you just wearing a regular shoe and on a regular pedal?\n[doctor]  I'm on a regular shoe, some most of the time I'm in my flip flops.\n[patient]  Okay, okay. The how is there anything that you were doing out of the ordinary when this started?\n[doctor]  No, I don't, that's the thing I don't remember an injury. If it was something that I injured, I think I would have just ignored it and wouldn't have showed up here, but when it got red and warm to touch, that's when I was really concerned.\n[patient]  Okay, do does even light pressure to it bother it like at night when you're laying in bed to the sheets bother.\n[doctor]  Absolutely, I was just going to say when I'm in bed at night and those sheets come down on it or I roll over Yeah, that hurts a lot.\n[patient]  Okay, have you done anything to try to get it to feel better any soaks or taking any medicine?\n[doctor]  I take you know like a 2 ibuprofen a day and that doesn't seem to help.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Alrighty.\n[patient]  Let me see your foot here and let me take your big toe through a range of motion if I push your top to bottom.\n[doctor]  Yeah, out.\n[patient]  Big toe joint that okay and let me move it up whereas I bend it up does that hurt.\n[doctor]  It hurts, but not as much as when you moved it down.\n[patient]  Okay, so I'm moving it down here and I've got about 10 degrees of plantar flexion, does that hurt?\n[doctor]  Yeah, it a little when you take it a little further.\n[patient]  If I go a little bit further to 20 degrees, does that hurt?\n[doctor]  That hurts more, yeah.\n[patient]  Okay, if I push it on your big toe and move it back and forth does that hurt.\n[doctor]  Yes, it does, and it's almost like those joints that when you push it back, it's almost like it's grinding a little bit too.\n[patient]  Okay, if I push in between your big toe and your second toe, here does that hurt.\n[doctor]  A little bit, but not terrible.\n[patient]  Okay, what about if I push on the other side here?\n[doctor]  Yeah, you're right there on the outside of it, absolutely.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Yep.\n[patient]  Okay, and I'm feeling a little bit of bone spur here, as well let me get next ray.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  and after we take a peek, that will develop a plan.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  So at this point, what would I do if I'm going out of the room and then coming back?\n[doctor]  You could hit pause or hit the stop button and just restart at the next time you come in.\n[patient]  Okay, alrighty. So taking a look at your X-ray and you do have you, you have a large spur there on the top of your big toe joint.\n[doctor]  Oh\n[patient]  And you've lost a lot of the cartilage.\n[doctor]  Oh\n[patient]  And so you've got some arthritis in there we call this Halux rigidis and treatment for this to start off with. We put an insert in your shoe called an orthotic and we give you a little bit of anti-inflammatory medication or like a drug called maloxicam. You only have to take it once a day.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  It's usually pretty well tolerated, have you ever had any trouble with your stomach?\n[doctor]  No never never had any problems with my stomach. I love the I love the Mexican's food, the hotter the better. So I hope I never get a problem with my stomach.\n[patient]  I hope you don't either. One of the things that we get concerned about with an anti-inflammatory like that is that it can irritate the stomach. So if you do start to notice that you're getting heartburn or pain right there.\n[doctor]  Yeah\n[patient]  Below your sternum, you would need to stop taking the medicine and give me a call.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  And I want to see you back in two weeks to see how you're doing with that. If you're not seeing significant improvement, then we may have to talk about doing things that are a little more invasive like doing a shot.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  or even surgery to clean out the joint sometimes.\n[doctor]  Is that surgery?\n[patient]  I have to.\n[doctor]  Would that be?\n[patient]  I'm sorry.\n[doctor]  Would that be surgery clean out the joint?\n[patient]  Yeah, that would.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  That would be surgery if we went in and cleaned out the joints sometimes in really severe cases. We even just have to fuse the big toe joint we put it in a position of optimal function and we fuse it there. And then your pain goes away, you lose some motion, but you've already lost quite a bit of motion and the pain goes away so that that surgery really is very effective. But let's try to run from my knife a little bit longer.\n[doctor]  Okay, well you know I don't think I'm going to be able to do my work job. I'm on my feet every day and IITS and and quite frankly it's fishing season. So do you think you can give me a couple weeks off? So I can get out and get some fishing done.\n[patient]  No, I want you to be doing your regular activities. I want to know how this because if I put you out of work, can you come back in and say it feels better well? Is it because of the treatment or because of the rest? So, no, I want you to keep working. I want you to do your regular activities. And I really want you to put these or the the the the test and this medicine to the test. And we will see how you're doing in two weeks.\n[doctor]  Okay, where I really like catching blue going croppy. So okay, we'll keep working then I'll find time to do that later.\n[patient]  Very good we will see you in two weeks.\n[doctor]  Okay, thank you.",

Have you been, have you been doing alright?\n[patient]  No, I've been seeing you for years since I had my last heart attack in 2018, but I've been doing pretty good. I can't believe this happened again. I mean, I'm doing okay. I guess I just feel tired ever now and then, but overall, I mean, I guess I feel pretty well.\n[doctor]  Okay good were you able to enjoy the spring weather?\n[patient]  Yeah, so I mean I'm hoping now that I've had my little procedure that I'll feel better and feel like getting back out and and maybe doing some walking there some new trails here behind the rec center and maybe get out and walk those trails.\n[doctor]  That will be fine, I know you love walking the trails.

Now, tell me have you had any chest pain or any shortness of breath.\n[patient]  No, not really no chest pain or shortness of breath I've been doing some short walks right around the house.

And so the copay isn't too bad.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  And I've been taking them because I don't want my sense to close up and they told me that that to take them this, you know, all the time. And I've been taking them since I got out of the hospital.\n[doctor]  Okay, well very good. I'm glad you're doing that good for your Russell. And then please keep that up now. Tell me are you watching your salt intake and trying to change your diet?\n[patient]  Yeah, so when I was in the hospital, they said something about my way my heart pumps now.\n[doctor]  Hmm.\n[patient]  It's just a little low and I might keep fluid on my legs if I'm not careful.\n[doctor]  Right.\n[patient]  And it's going to be hard because, you know, I really do like pizza. And they told me that I'm really going to have to watch salt. And they said that there's a lot of salt in pizza.\n[doctor]  There is a lot of salt and pizza, and you know, and you're going to have to be able to avoid all the other salty foods as well. So, and I know that's hard, but it's very important for your heart to be able to function at its best right. And you want to be able to get out and walk, you know, walk, take those walks again at the park, and then you know to your photography. So, in order to do that, we're going to have to really cut back on those, okay.\n[patient]  Well\n[doctor]  Alright, so why don't we go ahead and do a quick physical exam on you here? I just want to take a look at your vital signs, look good, I'm glad to see you're tolerating the medication. While I'm going to go ahead and feel your neck here, I don't appreciate any jugular venous distension and there are no carotid brutes on your heart exam. There is a three out of six six systolic ejection murmur. It's heard at the left base, but that's pretty much. The same as last year, so we'll continue to monitor that. Okay, let me listen to your lungs here real quick, Russell your lungs are clear, so good, good in your extremities. I don't see any swelling or edema on your right radial artery, the cath side, there is clean and it's dry and intact and I don't see any hematoma, so that's good. And there is a palpable raw pulse. So Russell, I did review the results of your EKG, which showed normal sinus rhythm, good, our wave progression and evolutionary changes, which are anticipated. So let's go ahead and talk about my assessment plan for you for your first diagnosis of coronary artery disease, we are going to have you continue your aspirin 81 milligrams daily and brilinta 90 milligrams twice daily. And we're going to have you continue on that high dose statin that adervasted in you might call it lipitor 80 milligrams daily. And then also continue on that toprol 50 milligrams daily. Okay, and I'm also going to refer you to cardiac rehab. So for you to get some education about your heart and also give you the confidence to get back exercising regularly. Now I know patients love the cardiac rehab program. I think you'll do well. Does that sound good to you?\n[patient]  That sounds good document.\n[doctor]  Alright, so for your second diagnosis here, the newly reduced left ventricular dysfunction and moderate mitral regurgitation, I think your pumping function will improve in time you know they got you to the lab quickly. So I think that heart muscle is just stunned and you're very compliant, you're very good with your medications and following through with those. So I think it will recover. So that said, I want you to go ahead and continue, continue. Your lice in April, 20 milligrams a day, I don't think. You need a diuretic at this time, but I do want to add al-dactone 12. 5 milligrams daily and then you'll need to get labs next week okay and then we're going to repeat another echocardiogram echocardiogram in about two months.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Okay, and then for your hypertension, your third diagnosis of hypertension, I wanted to take your blood pressure just like you would you know every so often, and then because your blood pressure actually seemed fine at this time, so we will continue to monitor that, and I think you will tolerate the L-dactone well as well.\n[patient]  Alright sounds good document.\n[doctor]  Okay, well you take care, and you have a good evening.\n[patient]  Yeah you too.\n[doctor]  Bye.",

            "src": "[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  Good morning.\n[doctor]  Good morning, thanks, Dr. Dr. Cooper. I'm, I'm, you know, I'm a little, I'm sad to be in here, but you know, thanks for taking me and I appreciate it.\n[patient]  Sure, absolutely, what can I help you with today?\n[doctor]  So you know I've been dealing with my asthma and like I tried to join sports but it's really kind of it's getting hard you know and I I just wonder if there's something that can be done because I really do like playing water polo.\n[patient]  But I'm having difficulty breathing. Sometimes I've had to like you know, stop matches and sit on the side. Just to kind of like catch my breath and use my inhaler. So I was wondering if there was something we could do about it.\n[doctor]  And then I'm kind of a little bit worried, I think my mood is getting a little, a little worrisome, and I wanted to explore what my options were.\n[patient]  Okay, let's talk about the asthma first. So what inhaler are you using now?\n[doctor]  I have an Albuterol inhaler.\n[patient]  Okay, and when you're having trouble, it's usually just around sports that is keeping you up at night.\n[doctor]  So I don't really like wake up at night, a lot typically like it sports like, you know, if I'm doing anything like crazy aerobic or like running or anything I do notice that if any if I'm around smoke, I do start coughing a little bit, but most of the time it sports.\n[patient]  Okay, and can you describe a little bit from me what happens?\n[doctor]  I start to yanno so I start to feel like there is like some flim building up in my throat and I start coughing like my chest gets tight I start wheezing and I just have to sit down or else I'm going to get like lightheaded too.\n[patient]  Okay, and then when you use your inhaler.\n[doctor]  Hmm.\n[patient]  Does it alleviate the problem?\n[doctor]  So yet helps with that like flim feeling, you know, but I still have to sit down, you know, and like breathe. And then the thing that I hate about that inhaler is I start getting like shaky is that supposed to be happening.\n[patient]  Yes, that is unfortunately normal and a side effect with the inhaler.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  So you use your using two Puffs to the inhaler.\n[doctor]  Hmm.\n[patient]  for the symptoms.\n[doctor]  Yes.\n[patient]  And then you sit down and does it, does it get better within about 15 minutes or so?\n[doctor]  Yeah, yeah, it does, but you know, I had to like step out of the pool to make that happen. I'm hoping that there is something else we can do. Okay. Have you ever taken any daily medications for your asthma, an inhaler, or a singular, or anything like that? No, I just use my inhaler whenever I have an attack.\n[patient]  Okay, so that's something we might want to consider, but how often is it happening?\n[doctor]  Pretty much every time I do any kind of aerobic workout.\n[patient]  Okay, and outside of physical activity, you're not having any problems.\n[doctor]  Yeah, there's that part where like, if I'm around somebody who's been smoking a lot or is currently smoking, but I usually just step away. I don't even like to be around them, you know, that makes sense.\n[patient]  Alright, we will look at that tell me about the mood issues you're having.\n[doctor]  Yeah, so one of the reasons I got into like trying to get into sports is like I feel like you know you feel a lot more energized and a lot you know happier, but like lately I've just been kind of stressed out you know like I have I have like sets that I need to study for I've got like all these AP classes you know there's just I feel like there's a lot of pressure and you know like I get it but there are times where I'm just like really down and I don't really know what else I can do.\n[patient]  Okay, that makes sense. Any any difficulty with focusing or you're having difficulty retaining information or is it more feeling sad not having motivation?\n[doctor]  So I think it's like a lot of sadness, a lot of like you know I don't really I kind of feel like you know I don't really like want to do anything you know my friends will go out and I'll just be like I'd rather be at home. I am really tired a lot too.\n[patient]  Okay, all right, well let me let me go ahead and check you out.\n[doctor]  Hmm.\n[patient]  And then we can talk a little bit more.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  I'm going to take a listen to your heart and lungs.\n[doctor]  Hmm.\n[patient]  and everything sounds good.\n[doctor]  Let me take a look at your eyes.\n[patient]  And in your ears, everything looks okay. Have you had any problems with allergies? You have seasonal allergies or anything like that.\n[doctor]  Yeah, I think so, yeah.\n[patient]  I do see just a little bit of fluid in the ears.\n[doctor]  Hmm.\n[patient]  I'm gonna look in your mouth too.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  and throat looks fine no tonsils.\n[doctor]  Hmm.\n[patient]  Let me go ahead and have you lay back on the table and I'll take a listen to your stomach.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  Everything sounds okay. I'm going to feel around just to make sure everything feels normal.\n[doctor]  Hmm.\n[patient]  Everything feels fine and I'm going to check reflexes and they're all normal.\n[doctor]  Awesome!\n[patient]  It's really hard to do with actual patient. So in terms of the asthma, I think we could try a daily medication since it looks like you might be having a little bit of allergies, maybe we can try some singular.\n[doctor]  Hmm.\n[patient]  And start with that once you are on that daily, and you can continue to use the Albuterol inhaler those side effects, unfortunately you're right. It's just one of the expected side effects with an Albuterol inhaler. I would recommend just what you're doing to sit down for a little bit after you take it.\n[doctor]  And we will get you started on the singular probably within about a month you should see a difference. So I will have you come back in about six weeks and follow up and see how you're doing with that.\n[patient]  In terms of the mood, is this new for you?\n[doctor]  Yeah, I think so like when I started this year.\n[patient]  And it sounds like related to school expectations and the stress with saps and all of that.\n[doctor]  Yeah\n[patient]  Okay, let's consider having you start seeing a therapist. I think that would be a good place to start.\n[doctor]  Hmm.\n[patient]  and we will do some screening questionnaires and then follow up in a couple weeks on that too.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right, sounds like a plan, okay.\n[patient]  Thank you.",

            "src": "[doctor]  Hey Gene, how are you doing today?\n[patient]  I'm doing alright aside from this foot pain that I have.\n[doctor]  So I see here that you looks like you hurt your left foot here where you were playing soccer. Can you tell me a little bit more about what happened?\n[patient]  Yeah, so yeah, I was playing a soccer game yesterday and I was trying to steal the ball from another player and she ended up falling directly on my right foot and I don't know I mean I was trying to get around her and my body ended up twisting around her and then I accidentally fell to pain in my foot.\n[doctor]  Okay, so have you ever hurt your left foot before?\n[patient]  No, I've had a lot of injuries in soccer, but never injured this foot.\n[doctor]  Okay, and then so after the fall and the entanglement with the other player were you able to continue playing.\n[patient]  No, I had to stop playing right away and actually being helped off the field.\n[doctor]  Well, okay. And what have you been doing for the pain since then?\n[patient]  So I've been keeping it elevated icing at the trainer, wrapped it yesterday, and taking ibuprofen as well.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right, so without any ibuprofen, can you tell me what your pain level is?\n[patient]  Without ibuprofen, I would say my pain is a 3.\n[doctor]  Okay, and then with your ibuprofen, can you tell me what your pain level is?\n[patient]  Like a 7-8.\n[doctor]  Okay, so how long have you been playing soccer?\n[patient]  Really since I was like 4-5 I've been playing a long time.\n[doctor]  Well, that's cool. Yeah, we are our youngest daughter. She is almost 16 and she plays the Intermarial Soccer League. They are down at the Rec Center did. Is that where you started playing or did you guys? Did you start playing somewhere else?\n[patient]  Yeah, just like this local town leak, I started playing that way, and then played all throughout school.\n[doctor]  That's...\n[patient]  High school teams.\n[doctor]  That's awesome. So just out of curiosity with the left foot, have you experienced anything like numbness or tingling or any strange sensation?\n[patient]  No, I have not.\n[doctor]  Okay, now if it's okay with you, I would like to do a quick physical exam. I reviewed your vitals and everything looks good blood pressure was 118 over 72 heart rate, was 58 respiratory rate, was 14 UR A-FB, and you had an O2 saturation of 99% on room air on your heart exam, your regular of rate, and rhythm don't appreciate any clicks, rubs, or murmurs, no ectopic beats, noted thereon. Oskultation listening to your lungs lungs are clear and equal. Bilaterally, so you're moving good air, I'd like to do a focus foot exam on your left foot. So I do see some bruising on the bottom of your foot, and on the top of your foot, as well now, there's associated swelling, and I do appreciate tenderness to palpation of your midfoot, and you are positive for the piano key test on a neurovascular exam of your left foot, you have a brisk capillary refill of less than three second store-salis. Petus pulse is intact and strong, and you do have motor and sensation. That it's intact to light touch now, I would like to do a review of the diagnostic imaging that you had before you came in, so I do notice a subtle dorsal displacement of the base of the second metatarsal, with a three millimeter separation of the first and second metatarsal bases, and the presence of a bony fragment in the Liz-Frank joint space. So let me talk to you a little bit about my assessment, and plan now for the first. Concern of right foot pain, your right foot pain, is due to a Liz-Frank. Fracture, which is a fracture to one of your second metatarsal bones at the top of your foot, where the metatarsals meet your cuboids. Now there are ligaments at the top of your foot, so I'm going to be ordering an MRI to assess for injury to any of these ligaments now, based on your exam, and from what I'm seeing on your X-ray, your most likely going to need surgery of that foot, now the surgery will place the bones back in their proper. Position, and using plates and screws will hold them their while. They heal, and this is going to allow those bones and ligaments to heal properly. It is a day surgery, and you will be able to go home the same day, and then I'm going to have you follow up with me here in the clinic, you'll be in a cast, and you will need to use crutches, and you will not be able to use that left foot for about six to eight weeks now, after that six to eight weeks, you will gradually start walking on your foot based on how you tolerate it, and we'll see how you do at that point. So I do. Believe you're going to need surgery, I am recommending this, because there are significant complications to your foot if we do not do this poor bone and ligament healing can lead to losing the arch of your foot, and you're becoming flat footed, you also have a high likelihood of developing arthritis in that foot. So what I'm going to do, unfortunately, you'll be out the rest of the season, but we are going to get you fixed up and ready for next season if you're okay with all of this, I'm going to have the nurse come in and get you started on your paperwork, and then I will see you on Monday morning, and we will get your foot taken care of.\n[patient]  All right, thank you.\n[doctor]  You're welcome.",

I mean did it hurt a lot where you able to get up and continue on?\n[patient]  I landed on my side. I was not able to continue on.\n[doctor]  Okay, so you get off the off the court is Jerry a good player. You just got Ty asked that question.\n[patient]  Not really.\n[doctor]  No.\n[patient]  He doesn't have much game.\n[doctor]  Okay, okay. Well, you know I love basketball. I'm a little short for the game, but I absolutely love to watch basketball. So it's really cool that you're out there playing it. So tell me about a little bit about where it hurts.\n[patient]  on the inside.\n[doctor]  on the inside of it okay and after the injury did they do anything special for you or you know did you get ice on it right away or try anything.\n[patient]  I had ice in an ace wrap.\n[doctor]  You had ice and what?\n[patient]  an ACE rap.\n[doctor]  And an ace wrap okay. Now how many days ago was this exactly?\n[patient]  7\n[doctor]  Seven days ago, okay. Yeah, your right knee still looks a little swollen for seven days ago So I'm gonna go ahead and now I also see that you're diabetic and that you take 500 milligrams of metformin twice a day Are you still you're still on that medication is that correct?\n[patient]  Correct.\n[doctor]  And do you check your blood sugars every morning at home?\n[patient]  Every morning.\n[doctor]  Okay, great. And since this under reason I'm asking all these questions, I'm a little concerned about the inactivity with your knee pain. And you know how diabetes you need to be very, you know active, and then taking your medicine to keep that under control. So you know, may want to continue to follow up with your PCP for that diabetes as we go through here. And just watch your blood sugars extra as we go through that now I'm going to go ahead and examine your right knee. And when I push on the outside does that hurt at all?\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  Okay and when I push on this inside where it's a little swollen does that hurt?\n[patient]  Yes.\n[doctor]  Yo, Cam just gonna ask a question, did you hear or feel a pop in your knee when you were doing this?\n[patient]  I did not know.\n[doctor]  You did not okay. Okay. What are you doing for the pain today?\n[patient]  some exercises ice and mobic.\n[doctor]  Okay, okay. So I'm going to continue all of my exam when I go ahead and pull on your knee. The first thing I'm looking at is I do see some echinosis and swelling on the inside of that right knee. And when I push around that knee, I can see that there's fluid in the knee, a little bit of fluid in the knee. We call that effusion. So I can appreciate some of that effusion and that could be either fluid or blood at this point from the injury that you had. Now you do have pain with palpation on the medial aspect of that right knee. And that's that's concerning for me when I'm going to just I just want to move your knee a little bit. It doesn't look like when I extend it and flex it that you have a full range of motion. Does it hurt a lot when I moved it back a little more than normal?\n[patient]  Yes, it hurts.\n[doctor]  Okay, okay. Yes, so you do have some decreased range of motion in that right knee now. I'm just going to sit here and lay you back and I'm going to pull on your knee and twist your knee a little bit. Okay, you currently there is a negative varus and balga stress test that's really important. So here's what I'm thinking for that right knee. I think you have may have a medial collateral ligament strain from, you know, maybe the twisting motion be right before you fell to the ground. I want you to continue to use an ace wrap. I'm going to give you a right knee brace. We're going to wear that for a few days. And then I'm going to send you to physical therapy so we can continue strengthening the muscles around the right knee now that X-ray as far as the X-ray results that X-ray that I did it this morning in the office, the bony alignments in good position. I don't see any evidence of any fractures. I do notice that the effusion around the right knee just a small amount of fluid, but we're just going to continue. To watch that I'm going to give you a prescription, I'd like you to stop taking any of the non-steroidals that you're taking the motrin or advelle whichever one of those. And I'm going to give you Miloxicam 15 milligrams. And I want you to take that daily for the pain and swelling. I want you to just continue exercising with the braces. And everything on so if you can you can get out and do some light walking, they'll be good. And then again for your diabetes, like I said, just continue to watch those blood sugars daily. And if you start to see any significant increase in them because of your loss of activity, just reach out to your primary care physician. Now, do you have any questions for me?\n[patient]  What can I play basketball again?\n[doctor]  Yeah, that's a great question I'm going to ask. Well, my first off, I want to see you back here and in seven days, you know, in a week, I want you to make an appointment. We're going to relook at it. We're going to determine if that's swelling got any worse. And if we need to go on to potentially ordering like a cat scan or an MRI of that need a look and see if there was any significant damage to the ligament. So that's for sure for seven days or not. Going to be playing basketball. Now, are you in a league or is that just you get like pick up basketball?\n[patient]  I just played the wife with fun.\n[doctor]  Okay, okay, good. That's a great activity. Like I said, I wish I could play now. I also know you're your family. Don't they own that sports store down right off of Main Street that sells a lot of sporting equipment?\n[patient]  Yeah, they do.\n[doctor]  Okay, I know I'm just thinking you know I need to get some new shoes for some of it my activities. I love the I wish I could play basketball but I do a lot of bike riding. So I'm always looking for anything that's going to help me on the bike. Do you does your family have supplies like that?\n[patient]  We do let me know and I can get you the hook up.\n[doctor]  Okay, great, great. So I'll let you know I'll just get on and take a look first, but I'm going to go ahead and get you discharged. I'll have my assistant come and we will get you discharged. And like I said, we will make an appointment for seven days and we will go from there any questions.\n[patient]  I think you've answered them all. Thank you.\n[doctor]  Okay, great.",

I just can't, can't fall.\n[doctor]  Is it because you're having you can't sleep or you're having shortness of breath or difficulty breathing or what's going on with that?\n[patient]  Yeah, I feel like I'm just I'm just choking a few minutes after I lay down to sleep. I just can't catch my breath.\n[doctor]  Okay, and are you and how has your pulse ox been your oxygen level been at home?

How has that been at home?\n[patient]  I can breathe fine.\n[doctor]  Just when you lay down you get short of breath okay. And is it worse when you have you noticed any shortness of breath during the day, when you exert yourself, when you climb stairs or do other stuff?\n[patient]  I don't do any of that usually, I just sit on the couch and watch my shows.\n[doctor]  Okay, fair enough. And how about have you noticed any weight gain or swelling in your legs or calves or anything like that?\n[patient]  Yeah, I can't see my ankles anymore and yeah, I don't know what's going on with the scale.

How is that going?\n[patient]  I don't know how much salt is in free does, but you know I'm really enjoying those and last weekend we got this really big party. And yeah which color is that Lasix pill?\n[doctor]  Yeah, it's the white one, the round one. So it sounds like you're not maybe not taking it as regularly as you should.\n[patient]  No sir, I don't think I am.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right.

So it's been a couple of weeks, are you coughing up anything any fevers with us at all?\n[patient]  No no fever, kind of feel like I'm just bringing a whole bunch of yuck up once in a while though, especially first thing in the morning.\n[doctor]  Okay, alright, and how have your blood sugars been doing this time? I know you're taking the metformin, are you checking your acuchex? How has that been going?\n[patient]  I'm sorry what's an acutech.\n[doctor]  For your blood sugar check, are you checking that or not really?\n[patient]  I did a couple of weeks ago.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  And it was about it. I think about 230 it was okay.\n[doctor]  Okay, so your hemoglobin A1c last time was seven. Five, and we had talked about, you know, trying to improve your diet, we had talked about, you know, we want to avoid going to insulin, but it sounds like it's been a challenge to kind of control the diet, and also your blood sugars have been running a little bit high.\n[patient]  Yeah.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right.\n[patient]  Yep, it's been a challenge.\n[doctor]  All right, in any nausea vomiting or diarrhea, or anything like that are you paying a whole lot, or anything like that know?\n[patient]  You have feeling like crazy.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right.\n[patient]  Can't figure out why because I'm not drinking very much.\n[doctor]  All right, and how is your back then? Has that been okay? I know you're sitting you said you're sitting on the couch a lot watching TV, but\n[patient]  Yeah.\n[doctor]  Besides that anything else.\n[patient]  Yeah, you know, it just really hurts. So, you know. And so that's why I sit on the couch so much.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right, no weakness or numbness in your legs right now.\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  So let me examine you now. Gloria, I'm going to go ahead and do an exam and let's pretend I did my exam. I'm just going to verbalize some of my findings just so I can record this and put it into my my into my chart. So, Neck exam, you do have a little bit of swelling in your neck, a little bit of JVD. No broods your lung exam. You have some crackles in both bases and some rals that I can hear and there are a little bit of intermittent wheezing as well on your heart exam. You have a two over six systolic ejection murmur. You've had that in the past otherwise regular rate and rhythm it doesn't feel a regular your belly exam. Your belly is slightly distended. There's no tenderness or guarding or anything like that. So that doesn't that looks pretty good on your leg exam. You do have some one plus pitting a dima or actually almost one and a half plus pitting a dima in your both of your ankles. No calf tenderness negative home in sign. That means no blood. Clots otherwise neurologic exam is normal the rest of. Your exam is normal. So what does this all mean? So let me explain that so for the first problem the shortness of breath. You know, I think you have an exacerbation of your congestive heart failure. What I'd like to do is increase your dose of lasix from 20 milligrams to 60 milligrams for the next four days. I'm going to have you check your weights every day and also I'm going to go ahead and have you use your albuterol and atroventway. Had given you some inhalers in the past, I can give you another refill if you need to help with that. Some of the breathing that you're having the shortness of breath. So I'd like to get some of this fluid off. You have you check your weights daily. We'll have you increase your dose of lasix. We'll have you use a breathing treatments and see if that helps your shortness of breath. I'd like to have you come back in about a couple days. Actually, I want to see how you're doing and if it doesn't get better, we may have to increase the dose or send. You to the hospital. Okay.\n[patient]  I don't want to go to the hospital doctor.\n[doctor]  Yes, so let's try to let's try to use the lasix. And let's try to let's try to use the breathing treatments and do that for the second problem, the diabetes that we just talked about. I like to go ahead and order another blood test, another hemoglobin. A1c, I think we need to your blood sugars, have been running a little bit high in the past and we've had a hard time. But it's been a while since we checked your last one, so I want to check another one today to see where we are and when we have you come back in a couple days, we should have the results back. We can then adjust your metformin or we may have to adjust some of you know, add a different medication at that point. But right now I'm going to order some blood tests. We'll have you come back in a couple of days and then we can reassess at that point, okay.\n[patient]  So I had a piece of cake before I came in here. Is that going to affect the lab work?\n[doctor]  Yeah, we'll probably do a fasting blood sugar. We'll order the hemoglobin, a one-sea that shouldn't be actually matter because that checks long term. But if we need your blood sugar, maybe elevated today, I wouldn't be surprised all right. And I forgot to examine your back, by the way. So on your back exam, you do have some tenderness in the parsed vinyl areas of your back and the in the lower back, mostly no midline tenderness you have. Good reflexes. So I think this is all muscular pain right now for your back pain. I'm going to go ahead and put you on some nappersine and some flexoril, which is a muscle relaxer. I'm going to give you some exercises you can do to help you get off the couch. It'll also help your blood sugar. And why don't we have you if that doesn't work through the pain medicine and the physical we can start physical therapy and see if that helps okay.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Any questions about that?\n[patient]  I don't think so which color pills.\n[doctor]  I think it's a white pill and it's round.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  about this big.\n[patient]  Alright, sounds good.\n[doctor]  Anything else, Gloria?\n[patient]  No, that's it.\n[doctor]  Alright, thanks for coming in today.",

Can you tell me a little bit more about that?\n[patient]  Yeah, I did my wife and I were on a walk yesterday and I was just talking to her and and stepped off the curb and landed on it wrong. It's kind of embarrassing, but it's been killing me for a couple days now.\n[doctor]  Okay now when you felt did you feel or hear a pop or anything like that.\n[patient]  I wouldn't say I really heard a pop, it was just kind of really kind of felt extended and stretched. And it has just been really bothering me ever since kind of on the outside of it.\n[doctor]  Okay, and then were you able to walk on it after the incident?\n[patient]  I was able to get back to the house because I didn't want to make my wife carry me, but it was painful.\n[doctor]  Okay, and then have you done any or had any injuries to that ankle before?\n[patient]  Nothing substantial that I would say in the past.\n[doctor]  Okay, and then what have you been doing for that left ankle since then have you done anything to help make it make the painless?\n[patient]  I have taken some ibuprofen and then I just tried to elevate it and ice it a little bit and keep my weight off of it.\n[doctor]  Okay, so let's talk real quick about your pain level zero being none 10 being the worst pain you've been in in your life without any medication on board. Can you rate your pain for me?\n[patient]  I would say it's about a date.\n[doctor]  Okay, and then when you do take that ibuprofen or Tylenol, what's your relief level? What's your pain look like then?\n[patient]  Maybe a seven and it's a little.\n[doctor]  Okay, now you mention going for a walk my wife, and I've been on on back behind the new rec center where the new trails are have you guys been back there.\n[patient]  We haven't yet, but I'm sure we'll check it out ever since I feel like working at home during COVID-19.\n[doctor]  Yai!\n[patient]  No, I haven't been there yet.\n[doctor]  Yeah, those those trails are great. There's like five miles of regular flat trails. And then there's a bunch of hiking trails that they've opened up as well. It's a really great place. Man, you guys need to get out there. We'll get you fixed up and we'll get you back out there, okay?\n[patient]  Awesome.\n[doctor]  So let's talk a little bit about my physical exam. If it's okay with you, I'm going to do a quick physical exam on you. Your vitals look stable. By the way, a little elevated. I know you're in pain on a focused exam of your left ankle now. I do appreciate that there is echinosis or bruising over the lateral maliolis. And there is some swelling. I do appreciate some adema now. You are positive for tenderness to palpation on the lateral side and the the soft tissue is swollen here. The good news is I do not appreciate any laxity in the joint. Okay. And I don't feel any any type of bony tenderness to palpation of your foot now on the neurovascular exam of your left foot capillary refill is brisk less than three seconds. And I do appreciate strong dorsalus pitus pulses. And you do have motor and sensation intact, which is good now. It's important that they were compared bilaterally and they are yeah your exam is the same bilaterally so that that's an important thing. Now we did do an x-ray of that left ankle. When you came in, so I'm going to review those x-ray results with you now. The good news is I do not appreciate a fracture or any bony abnormalities. So that's a good thing right. So let me talk to you a little bit about my assessment and plan. So for your first problem of your left ankle pain, your symptoms are consistent with an ankle sprain of the lateral ligament complex and the ligament on the outside of your ankle is what got stretched when you fell now the best treatment for. This sprain is what you've kind of already been doing doing the elevation and compression and ice. So we're going to continue the rice protocol. And I'm going to go ahead and give you an air cast just to stabilize that ankle. I'm going to prescribe you some crutches. I want you to stay off that leg, but I do want you to start walking as tolerated, but it may be a few days before you feel like doing that now your symptoms are going to get better significantly over the first you know four five six seven days. But I'm going to want to follow up with you just to make sure you're doing okay. So what I do is I would like to see you in two weeks and I'm going to have you continue taking those NSDS as well to help reduce that pain and swelling any other questions, comments or concerns before I have the nurse come in and get you fixed up.\n[patient]  No, I think that sounds like a plan.\n[doctor]  Okay sounds good like I said I will see you in two weeks if you have any questions or if you have a lot of pain come back and will reevaluate otherwise I think you're headed in the right direction and I'll see you again in two weeks.\n[patient]  Awesome thanks document.\n[doctor]  Alright, thanks bye bye.",

It sounds like you have sensation there. So yeah, that that's really good. So let me do a quick physical exam on you. So I reviewed your vitals, your blood pressure was 120 over 80, which is good. Your heart rate, your SPO2 was 98%, which is good. That means you're getting all of your oxygen. And so let me go ahead and look at your ankle real quick. So when I press here, does that hurt?\n[patient]  Yeah.\n[doctor]  Alright, what about here?\n[patient]  Yeah.\n[doctor]  Okay, so looking at your ankle and your right ankle exam on the skin there is echinmosis. So you have that bruising which you can see of the lateral.\n[patient]  Malielis\n[doctor]  Malielis associated with swelling, there is tenderness to palpation of the anterior laterally in the soft tissue. There is no laxity on the anterior drawer, and in version stress, there is no bony tenderness on palpation of the foot on your neurovascular exam of your right foot, your capillary refill, is less than three seconds strong dorsalus pedispulse, and your sensation is intact to light touch. All right, so we did get in. X-ray of your ankle before you came in, and luckily it's there is no. Fractures no bony abnormalities, which is really good. So let me talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you. So for your right ankle pain, your symptoms, your symptoms are consistent with a right ankle sprain, have you sprained your ankle before? Most times people do the athletics play soccer, it happens every so often, but have you done that before?\n[patient]  know what i think so\n[doctor]  Okay, well, you're one of the lucky ones, some of my patients that play sports. They spray in their ankle, seems like every other week so good for you. So for that, that ankle spray, I just want to keep, I want you to keep your leg elevated when you're seated. And I want you to continue to isolate. You can isolate, say, five times a day for 20 minutes at a time, just to help that swelling go down. I'm going to give you an air cast to help you. Stabilize the ankle. So keep it from moving. And then I'll give you crutches. And so I want you to stay off that leg for about one to two days. And then you can start walking on it as tolerated, tolerated. So how does that sound?\n[patient]  It's alright.\n[doctor]  Alright, so, do you have any questions for me?\n[patient]  You like how long do you think it's gonna take for me to heal?\n[doctor]  I mean, it should take a couple of days. I mean, I think in a day or two you'll be able to walk on it, but still think it will be sore for the next couple of weeks. You know, your ankle sprain seems to be not the worst, but it's kind of, you know, medium grade ankle sprain. So as I would say about two to three weeks, you should be back to normal. You will see some of that bruising go away.\n[patient]  Yeah, okay, can I get a doctor's note?\n[doctor]  No, because you need to go back to work, because you work on the computer not running so.\n[patient]  Fine.\n[doctor]  Yeah, you can't get a doctor's note. So if you if I write a note, I'm going to tell your boss that you have to go to work.\n[patient]  Okay thanks.\n[doctor]  So I wouldn't do that, but yeah. But otherwise, if you continue to have pain after this week, if you feel like it's not getting better, please feel free to contact the office. And we can get you back in and possibly do an MRI if we no need to.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Alright.\n[patient]  All right.\n[doctor]  Anything else?\n[patient]  No, that's it.\n[doctor]  Alright, thanks.",

I know you've heard about Dax's it okay if I tell Dax a little bit about you.\n[patient]  Sure.\n[doctor]  Okay, so Gabriel is a 43-year-old male today here for back pain evaluation and also has a past medical history of diabetes, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol. So Gabriel tell me what's going on with your back.\n[patient]  while I was working the yard and you know been over to pick something up and I got this pain and you know across the lower part of my back and then it went down my left leg and you know it's been going on for about four days and just doesn't seem to be getting any better.\n[doctor]  Ok, are you a big gardener or this is something that you just started working in the yard?\n[patient]  Yeah, I know my wife held a gun to my head. Make me go out there working a yard and carry some stuff around. It's not my not my first choice, but...\n[doctor]  Sure sure.\n[patient]  But that day, I lost the, I lost the argument.\n[doctor]  Yeah, yeah, that happens to all of this. So when this back pain happened, so it was basically you were lifting, you were bending down to lift something up, and you had the sharp pain going down your right, like you said.\n[patient]  Left leg.\n[doctor]  Left leg, okay got it sorry and any weakness or numbness in your legs or just the pain mostly.\n[patient]  In certain positions I get some tingling, but no mostly just pain.\n[doctor]  Okay, and any loss of bowel or bladder function at all or anything like that.\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  Okay, and have you had any back surgeries or back problems in the past or this is kind of the first time?\n[patient]  No surgeries you know I've had back pain occasionally over the years.\n[doctor]  Okay, have you had any, any, any, have you tried anything for pain for this? Have you tried any, any medications at all?\n[patient]  I've had ibuprofenated help sum.\n[doctor]  Okay, got it all right. Well, I'll examine you in a second. But before we do that, let's talk about some of the other conditions that we're kind of following you from looking at your problem list now. And you've got a history of diabetes, and you're on Metformin 500 milligram twice a day. And you're how are you doing with your blood sugars and your, and your diet and exercise?\n[patient]  Yeah, I check my sugar 2 or 3 times a week most of the time, it's in that 120 to 140 range.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  Yeah, I take my medicine, okay, my diet is alright, you know, I could be 15 pounds lighter, that would be alright, but\n[doctor]  Sure.\n[patient]  I think the sugar has been okay.\n[doctor]  Okay, we checked your hemoglobin, a1c last time I'm looking at your records and epic, and it showed that it was you know 7. One so it's it's good, but it could be better any, you know, we talked about it controlling your diet or improving your diet and trying to have a balanced meal and not eating some of these sweets and high sugar items. How is that going? I know you had talked about your wife being a great cook and making cookies and that's hard to stay away from obviously how things going with that.\n[patient]  Yes, she still makes cookies and I still eat them, but you know we're trying to try to do better, try and stay away from more of those carbs and focus on, you know, less cardio, less sweet stuff.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right, yeah, that's always a struggle. I certainly understand, but you know, really important with your diabetes, just to prevent some of the complications like kidney failure and eye problems, and just keep your sugar under balance. So I'll order another hemoglobin A1c today. We'll check that again today. And, you know, just re-emphasizing the controlling your diet and exercise is super important. And then we'll have those. Results back will see if we need to make any modifications, okay.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  For your high blood pressure, your blood pressure, and the clinic looks pretty good, it's about 120 over 70. Right now we have you on Norvask 5 milligrams, once a day how are things going with that? Are you checking that periodically or any issues with that at all?\n[patient]  Yeah, I guess I check it maybe once a week or two or three times a month. And at the vast majority of the time, when I check it, it's good. Usually either that 120 to 130 over 70 to 80 range, I think the blood pressure is okay.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  I haven't had any real problems there. I have had some some swelling in my ankles though.\n[doctor]  Okay, is that new war? Is that been going on for a while?\n[patient]  Well it started maybe I don't know a month or two after I started the Norvask.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  and I was just wondering if the two might be related.\n[doctor]  Yeah, I mean, certainly it could be it is, you know, sometimes that medication can cause that so I'll examine you in a second and see if we need to make any modifications okay.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Alright, so, and you're anything else bothering you today.\n[patient]  No, I'm doing okay, I think.\n[doctor]  So let me examine you for a second. I'm going to go ahead and Gabriel. I'm going to do my magic exam. Now let's pretend I am just going to verbalize some of my findings as I do my exam. And so.\n[patient]  These are like my video visit exams.\n[doctor]  Exactly, so your neck exam has no JVD. There is no roots that I can hear your lung exam, no rals, no wheezing on your heart exam. You do have a 2 over 6 systolic ejection murmur you had that in the past. So I'm not too worried about that otherwise regular rate and rhythm on your heart exam on your on your belly exam is nice and soft on your back exam. You do have some tenderness on the left paris spinal area, right where I'm pressing right there your straight leg raise test is negative your reflexes are normal. You have some just some tenderness in the lower back in the paris spinal area of your back. When I palpate there otherwise your neurological exam is normal on your extremity exam. You do have this one plus non-pitting edema of your lower extremities, which is a little bit of swelling in your ankles no calf tenderness negative home in sign, no signs of blood. Clot, that's what that means. So let me just review what you know explain what all this means. So the back pain the first problem that you're here today for I think this is more of a muscular sprain I'm going to recommend we start you on some anti-inflammatory napperson 500, 500 milligrams twice a day and flexural 10 milligrams twice a day as well. I'm going to refer you to for for physical therapy to help strengthen some of the muscles in your lower back. I don't think you need an x-ray at this stage. Why do we start with physical therapy and the muscle relaxers and the pain medicines if it doesn't get better then we can get an x-ray but right now I would start with that if that's okay with any questions about that.\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  Okay, for the diabetes, the second problem that we talked about today, I'm going to order another hemoglobin, A1c, continue the metformin 500 milligrams twice a day. Why don't we have you come back in about two weeks, and we should have some of the results back, and we can discuss if we need to make any modifications for that, but right now we will continue the course, and we will go from there okay, for the high blood pressure. You do have this 1 plus edema in your legs, I'm going to go ahead and order some blood work today, I'm going to go ahead and stop the norvask, and we'll put you on some hydrochlorothiazide 10 milligrams once a day. And if that doesn't get if the swelling doesn't go away, I'm going to do some more testing for right now. Let's get some sort off with some CBC, and a BMP, I'm going to check your kidney function, I'm going to get another EKG, and also I'm going to get a chest X-ray, and we'll go from there, but hopefully, this will go away once we stop this medication since it started around. That time okay, okay, and I think that's it, anything else we forgot about, do you need refills for anything?\n[patient]  No, I think I'm okay. You gave me a year's worth of refills last time we were together.\n[doctor]  Okay sounds great alright thanks Gabriel Good seeing you again.\n[patient]  Good to see you, thanks.",

What what's when did the injury like what sorry what happened in the injury?\n[patient]  So I was flying down this black diamond, you know, like I like to do.\n[doctor]  Yes.\n[patient]  And this kid who was going faster than me spent by me so then I tried to speed pass them and then I ran into a tree and twist my knee.\n[doctor]  So we were downhill skiing racing at this point okay, is it your left or your right knee?\n[patient]  It's my ride.\n[doctor]  Okay, and does it hurt on the inside or the outside?\n[patient]  Be inside.\n[doctor]  Okay, so the medial aspect of the right knee when you fell did you hear a pop?\n[patient]  I did yes.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right.\n[patient]  I think I was my left knee.\n[doctor]  Okay, okay. Alright, so we got we got top pick one if it if it.\n[patient]  I'm just trying to be real.\n[doctor]  No.\n[patient]  What happens in the inner reel?\n[doctor]  100%. So how about this right now you're like, I what I'm hearing is that you're experiencing bilateral knee pain like both of your knees hurt, but I'm assuming that like your right knee hurts more. Is that correct?\n[patient]  Yeah, my left knee doesn't really hurt.\n[doctor]  Ah!\n[patient]  That's the one that popped at the left knee just feels unstable, but my right knee hurts.\n[doctor]  Gotcha, gotcha. Okay, yeah, I think I'm all right. So we're gonna go ahead and look at this sort of but on a scale of 1 to 10 house severe is your pain.\n[patient]  It's a 7.\n[doctor]  Okay, that's pretty bad, alright. And does it has it been increasing or like rapidly or slowly over the last few days?\n[patient]  It's been slow.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right.\n[patient]  But sometimes it gets to an 11.\n[doctor]  Okay, what would you know if you are doing something that would cause it to be an 11 or you back on your skis?\n[patient]  No, I can't ski.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  Usually when I walk my dog.\n[doctor]  Okay, does it hurt more when you walk for longer periods of time?\n[patient]  Yes.\n[doctor]  Okay, how long does the pain last?\n[patient]  for as long as my walk is and I don't sometimes I walk five minutes kind of depends on the wind.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right.\n[patient]  Sometimes I walk there is.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right, have you done anything to help with the pain?\n[patient]  while I wear a brace and I have used a lot of THC cream on it.\n[doctor]  Okay, alright THC cream is an interesting choice, but do you think that's been helpful?\n[patient]  Yes.\n[doctor]  Alright, have you taken?\n[patient]  Reasons\n[doctor]  Not a problem have you taken any medications.\n[patient]  Notice gummies.\n[doctor]  Okay, like vitamins or more THC.\n[patient]  Kinda like THC gummies.\n[doctor]  THC gummies.\n[patient]  My grandma gave them to me.\n[doctor]  THC gummies from grandma, that's an excellent grandmother that you have okay. Have you noticed any swelling stiffness tenderness?\n[patient]  Yeah, I get a lot of swelling and it really is, it's very stiff in the morning until I get walking.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right. And then have you had any hospitalizations or surgeries in the past?\n[patient]  While I had surgery on my right knee before.\n[doctor]  Okay, so you've had surgery before. All right, do you remember what kind of surgery?\n[patient]  I don't know they told me they reconstructed the whole thing I was 14. I was a really good gymnast back then really good.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  and I was doing a back summer saw and I felt a pop thin and then since that time I've really had problems with my knee.\n[doctor]  Ah, ah,\n[patient]  But you know the athlete that I am, I can still really ski very well. So I just kept going.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  And I'm really tough, my pain tolerance is very high.\n[doctor]  Okay, okay, okay, how so? Do you have any other exercises that I might want to know about outside of intense gym and ski events?\n[patient]  Now I think that's about it.\n[doctor]  Okay, and how frequently do you normally ski?\n[patient]  A ski probably three times a week.\n[doctor]  Okay, and then are you on any medications at this time other than the THC?\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  Okay, alright, what?\n[patient]  Nothing know.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right, not a problem. So if you don't mind, I'm going to go ahead and start my examination. I'm just going to call it out for the sake of being able to document it appropriately. And you, or just just let me know if you want me to explain anything further. So with your knee, I know that you said it hurts on the right inside a lot, right? So when I press on the inside of your knee, does that hurt?\n[patient]  Yes.\n[doctor]  Okay, and when I press on the outside of your left of your right knee, sorry, does that hurt?\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  Okay, alright, so when I move your kneecap, does that hurt?\n[patient]  No, it kind of makes a shooting pain down to my ankle though.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  But it doesn't hurt my knee.\n[doctor]  Okay, so does the pain radiate frequently.\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  I've never really noticed it just mess with my kneecap.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right on your skin exam. I do appreciate some mild swelling and bruising that's really interesting since it's been two weeks with your knee. Are you able to bend it?\n[patient]  Yes.\n[doctor]  Okay, and then when you walked in on your gate, I think I did appreciate a slight limp or UIII, I think you are you are protecting one of your knees does that sound familiar.\n[patient]  Yeah, the water is pretty good now.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right. And when you move your knee away from your body, you're bending like you're pulling it towards me. Does that hurt?\n[patient]  Yes.\n[doctor]  Okay, and then when you pull your knee back towards you does that hurt.\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  Alright, so pain on dorsiflexion, but not on plantar flexion, plantar flexion, okay? Alright, so what we are going to do right now, I think I'm going to look at your X-rays, but when I look at the results of your X-ray, I do not appreciate any fracture. What I am noticing is the development of a little bit of arthritis, and that could explain why you say that your joints hurt a bit more during windy weather, and what not so this. Is what we're going to do for my assessment and plan right the first? Thing is, I think you have a strain of your posterior cruciate ligament. What that means is what that will mean for you, though. Is that we are going to continue to brace your right knee that's going to hopefully take off some of the stress that you might be putting on it especially since your linting, I am going to recommend you for physical therapy. I think it would be, and I think it's a good idea to maybe start three times a week to get your strength back into. Your knee, I would recommend not skiing or doing any gymnastics for now, and I think that physical therapy will really help considering the injury that you had when you were 14. I'm going to prescribe you some medications. I don't necessarily recommend consuming gummies at the same time, but the medications I'm going to give you are going to be Miloxicam 15 milligrams. You're going to take that once a day that will help with the swelling and the bruising. I'm also going to prescribe you just like a higher strength N said. So I be profanate. 100 milligrams a day, you can take that twice a day as needed for your left knee. I think you are, I think you just kind of like strength a little bit, but like not enough to necessarily require any kind of like medication or bracing. I think you just take it easy on your body. I know that you're like very active from what I hear, and I think that that's really exciting, but I think you might need to listen to your body and give yourself a bit of a break. You'll be able to do like several workouts when you go to when you go to physical therapy, but you know, let the yell at your therapist be your guide about like what you should and should not be putting your body through does that make sense.\n[patient]  Yes.\n[doctor]  Alright, do you have any questions right now?\n[patient]  No thank you so much.\n[doctor]  No problem.",
