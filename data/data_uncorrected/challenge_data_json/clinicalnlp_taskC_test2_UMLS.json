[You]'re ready to get started?\n[patient]  [Yes], I am.\n[doctor]  So, Carolyn is a 49-year-old [female] here for follow-up of her chronic problems. So, how are you doing, Carolyn?\n[patient]  I'm doing okay. My [osteoarthritis] has been flaring up a little bit lately. So I want to get [talk] about that primarily. So it's mostly in my elbows and it's really been bothering me. I've been [sitting] at the computer at the desk more in the office. So [I don't know] if it's being stagnant in that position all day has increased flare-up for that. But I want to [talk] to you about that.\n[doctor]  Okay, sure. And are you right or left-handed?\n[patient]  I'm right-handed.\n[doctor]  Okay, and does one [elbow] bother you more than the other?\n[patient]  My [right elbow] does bother me more than the other, but primarily, I'm typing all day versus writing, so it... ...it flares up in both.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right, and any other [joint pain]?\n[patient]  No, just really focused on my elbows.\n[doctor]  Okay, and any numbing or [tingling] in your [hands].\n[patient]  Sometimes when I'm typing for long [periods] of time, I [feel] a little bit of numbing. I try to [shake] out my [arms] a little bit. Just to kind of relieve that [sensation].\n[doctor]  Okay, alright, and I know that you've had this also had this [history] of [gout]. And the last episode you had was about three months ago. [You] had some [inflammation] of your [toe]. Have you had any other issues with that?\n[patient]  No, I haven't. The [medication] you gave me really controlled it and I haven't seen a flare-up [sense].\n[doctor]  Okay. Alright, and how are you doing with your [psoriasis]?\n[patient]  That's been under control too. That hasn't been a major [problem] for me either.\n[doctor]  Okay, I know that we had given you some club edisol for your [scalp]. Is that so that's doing okay?\n[patient]  Yeah, that's doing a [lot] better.\n[doctor]  Okay, great. Um, all right. [Well], I'd [like] to go ahead and do a physical exam on you.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Let's first [look] at your [vital signs]. Hey, dragon, show me the [vital signs]. Great. So everything looks good from that perspective. So looking at you, I don't appreciate any cervical lymphedenopathy. Your [heart] is a nice regular rate and [rhythm], and your [lungs sound] really clear. On your [right elbow], you do have some [edema] and [inflammation] of your right [electron] on, and there's some [tenderness] and an [effusion] right there. So does that hurt when I press it?\n[patient]  Yeah, that does hurt.\n[doctor]  Okay and when I [turn] your [arm], do you have [pain]?\n[patient]  Yeah, that hurts a bit too.\n[doctor]  Okay, so she is [pain] to palpation of the [electron] on Bertha and [pain] with pre-nation and [supination]. And when you flex and when you [bend] it and straighten it, does that hurt?\n[patient]  Yeah, it doesn't a bit stiff too.\n[doctor]  Okay, so [pain] with [flexion] and extension of the [right arm]. Uh, your [abdomen] is nice and soft and there's no [lower extremity edema]. Uh, let's go ahead and take a [look] at some of your labs. [You] know, you have a [lot] of [arthritis] for someone so young, so we had sent off that autoimmune panel. Hey, [Dragon]. Show me the autoimmune labs. Hey, [Dragon]. Show me the autoimmune profile. Hey, [Dragon]. Show me the ESR. Okay, so that's good. Hey, [Dragon]. Show me the [uric acid]. Okay. All right. [Well], good. That's great. So, you know, it doesn't [look] like you have any systemic [arthritis] or [cysts], systemic inflammatory and process going on. So my [impression] of you at this time is that from a [gout] standpoint, everything is nice and stable. I [think] that we should continue you on the Cultusine 0.6 milligrams twice a day as needed for flare ups of your [gout]. Um, and then for [osteoarthritis], I'd [like] to go ahead and order a [right elbow] [X-ray]. Hey, [Dragon]. [Order] a [right elbow] [X-ray]. And then I'd [like] to prescribe some [Meloxicam] 15 milligrams once a day for the [pain] and the [swelling].\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Hey, [Dragon]. [Order] [Miloxicam] 15 milligrams once a day. And then I'd [like] to just [see] those how the [X-ray] show shows up and the results of that before we refer you for any type of physical therapy, okay?\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  And then from a [psoriasis] standpoint, I [think] everything is stable. We'll continue you on the [steroid cream] for your [scalp], okay?\n[patient]  That [sounds] good.\n[doctor]  Alright, do you have any questions?\n[patient]  No, that's it.\n[doctor]  Alright, take [care].\n[patient]  Thank you.\n[doctor]  Hey, [Dragon].

Now, if you don't [mind], I'd [like] to tell DAX a little bit about you.\n[patient]  Go for it.\n[doctor]  Great. Beverly is a 24-year-old [female patient], and I know you have a [history] of [type 2 diabetes] and [high blood pressure]. [Correct]?\n[patient]  Yep.\n[doctor]  Okay, so you're here today for your yearly exam. Haven't seen you in a year. How are you doing?\n[patient]  I've been doing well. I began working in a bakery this summer, which has been super fun. I have really been enjoying working there, but I find myself since I'm so close to so many delicious treats, snacking a [lot] during shifts and [eating] a [lot] more desserts than I normally would.\n[doctor]  Okay, so that brings me to your [diabetes]. So, how have your [blood sugar] spin?\n[patient]  Not so good.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  So they've been up and down because of my diet. I [think] because I've been taking my [medication] as prescribed. So I haven't missed anything there, but my diet has been pretty bad lately.\n[doctor]  Pretty bad lately.\n[patient]  Yeah.\n[doctor]  Okay, and that's really the only thing that's different is your diet pretty much.\n[patient]  Yeah.\n[doctor]  And that's because of the [new job] and all that.\n[patient]  Yeah, it has been really challenging to resist the [temptation].\n[doctor]  It's hard to ignore those desserts, aren't they?\n[patient]  Yeah.\n[doctor]  No will power like me.\n[patient]  No, no [willpower].\n[doctor]  Okay, alright. And then I know you've had [high blood pressure], [hypertension]. How is how have your [blood sugars] been? Have you been checking them?\n[patient]  So my [blood pressure] has been good, despite my [diabetes] levels being up and down.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  So that's been good.\n[doctor]  Okay, so your [blood pressures] have been normal. [You]'ve been [sleeping] well?\n[patient]  Yep, getting a full eight hours.\n[doctor]  No concerns about hurting yourself or anything like that.\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  Okay, good. Okay, and I know my, um, nurse did a review of systems. [Other] than what we've talked about so far, is there anything else that you needed to add?\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  Good. So pretty much status quo, except for those things that we've been working on, right?\n[patient]  Yep.\n[doctor]  Okay, good. Alright. [Well], let me do a quick physical exam, okay?\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Okay, [squeeze] my [finger] here. Good. Can you [feel] me [touch] out here?\n[patient]  Yep.\n[doctor]  Okay, and can you [feel] me [touch] you down here?\n[patient]  Yep.\n[doctor]  Okay, no [swelling]. Push your [leg] out. Good. Pull it [back]. Go. Good. Okay. So on my exam, essentially, your exam is normal. Your [heart] is regular. [You] do have that [grade] two systolic [ejection fraction] [back] [ejection murmur] that you that we've heard in the past. Okay, so we definitely know that's there. That's [unchanged]. Okay. Your [lungs] are clear. Your [grips] are equal. Nurovascular is intact. [You] don't have any [carotid] boots in your [neck]. No thyramegaly. No [edema]. [Pulse]'s are good, so essentially your exam is essentially normal. Let's take a [look] at some of your lab work. Okay?\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Hey, [Dragon], show me the [hemoglobin] A1c. Okay, so [blood sugars] have been elevated. Your [hemoglobin] A1c is elevated as well, so that tells me your [blood sugars] have been a little bit out of control. [You]'re still taking them at formin, correct?\n[patient]  [Yes], I am.\n[doctor]  Okay, and you take that twice a day?\n[patient]  Yep.\n[doctor]  Okay. Ooh, hey, dragol. Show me the [vital signs]. Okay. Good news here is your [blood pressure] is good. Everything, there's fine. So my assessment is, your first [problem] is [diabetes]. It's a little out of control. We'd [like] that [hemoglobin] A1c to be under seven, at least, preferably under six.\n[patient]  MM\n[doctor]  So, I'm not going to change your [medication]. I [think] this is diet [related], so I want you to try to [cut] down on the snacking and additional sweets, okay?\n[patient]  Yeah.\n[doctor]  And I want you to check your [blood sugars] in the morning. I want you to call them in in about two weeks, so we know what your first [fasting blood sugar] was in the morning. And then we'll come [back] and [see] you in about two months and [see] if everything has straightened out. If it hasn't, then we'll [talk] about adding another [medication], okay?\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Your second [problem] is your [hypertension]. That seems to be relatively stable. I want you to stay on your [current medication]. [You]'re only, licent-a-pril 10 milligrams once a day. Just stay right on that [medication]. No changes at this point. Seems to be doing well, okay?\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Good. Anything else I can do for you today?\n[patient]  No, that's it.\n[doctor]  Good, come with me, we'll get you checked out.\n[patient]  Thank you.\n[doctor]  Hey [Dragon], finalize the note.",

I haven't had any issues with that since we did the procedure and everything's been good.\n[doctor]  Okay, well great.

Can you straighten your [elbow] for me?\n[patient]  Yeah, it hurts and it's a bit stiff.\n[doctor]  Okay, so she is [pain] with [flexion] and extension of the [left elbow].

All right, so here it looks like, you know, your endoscopy results [look] like you had an episode of [Gastritis]. That's for your [peptic ulcer disease], and so everything, you know, you took your, your prognics, and I [think] everything resolved at that point, okay?\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  So let's [talk] a little bit about my assessment and my plan for you. So for your first [problem], this [left elbow] [pain], you know, I [think] you have a lecronomber [sinus] and we're just going to, you know, have you, you know, get a little pillow for your [elbow] there. It's just caused by repetitive [trauma].\n[patient]  MM\n[doctor]  So, maybe you're slamming your [elbow] down a little bit on the desk, so just get a little rest there.\n[patient]  Yeah.\n[doctor]  And we'll give you some mellow mLoxicam, 15 milligrams once a day. [You] can [ice] the area, okay? For your next [problem], the [epilepsy], [sounds] like you're doing really well. I would go ahead and continue with the [Keppra], 500 milligrams twice a day. Do you need a refill of that?\n[patient]  [Yes], I do.\n[doctor]  Hey, [Dragon], order a refill of Capra, 500 milligrams, twice daily. For your third [problem], the [depression], it [sounds] like you're doing well with the therapy, and if you want, we can [talk] about medical [treatment options].\n[patient]  Yeah, I [think] that would be great.\n[doctor]  Okay, well let's go ahead and we'll start you on some lexapro. 10 milligrams, once a day, and we'll [see] how you do on that, okay?\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  All right, and then for your last [problem], the peptical surdisease, I want you to continue on the prognics 40 milligrams once a day before meals, okay?\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Do you have any questions?\n[patient]  No, I don't.\n[doctor]  Okay, alright. [Well], the nurse will come in soon and [see] you, okay? And I'll [see] you in a couple of weeks.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Alright, take [care].

Anything like that?\n[patient]  No, [nothing] like that.\n[doctor]  Okay, and you know, I know that you've had a [kidney] [transplant] a few years ago.\n[patient]  [Yes].\n[doctor]  Everything is okay with that?\n[patient]  Everything's been good and solid there.\n[doctor]  and you're taking all of your auto, I am your [immunosuppression] [medications].\n[patient]  [Yes], I am.\n[doctor]  All right, so let's go ahead and we'll do a quick physical exam. So looking at you, you don't appear any [distress]. Your [neck] is nice and supple. Your [heart] is irregular rate and [rhythm]. I do [hear] a slight two out of six [systolic ejection murmur]. Your [lungs] are clear. I do [see] the [scar] on the left, left plank for your [kidney] [transplant], which is healed. And you have no [lower extremity edema]. So let's go ahead and [look] at some of your results, okay?\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Hey, dragon, show me the [creatinine]. So your [kidney function] looks really good. So that's really promising after your [transplant]. Hey, dragon, show me the EKG. And your EKG looks great. Uh, perfectly normal, so that's good. Um, so my [impression] of you at this time, let me [see] your [blood pressure].\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Hey, [Dragon], show me the [blood pressure]. Yeah, and you're right it.\n[patient]  HM\n[doctor]  It is high. So there is something that we can do for that. So let's go ahead and we'll put you on. So my [impression] of you is that your [blood pressure] is high and the norvask isn't [controlling] it. And you know, we can definitely get it under better control. So what I would [like] to do is prescribe you CoreG 25 milligrams twice a day. And that will help bring your [blood pressure] down, okay?\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Hey, [Dragon], order Carva Dylal 25 milligrams twice a day. I'd also [like] to go ahead and get a [lipid] panel and some routine labs on you just to make sure that everything is okay.\n[patient]  Yeah.\n[doctor]  Hey, dragon, order a [lipid] panel. Hey, dragon, order a complete metabolic panel. All right. And then from a [transplant] standpoint, everything looks fine. Your [kidney function] looks great, so we're just going to continue you on all of those [medications]. So the nurse will come in soon and she'll help you schedule all of the owl. Schedule a follow-up appointment with me, and we'll [see] where your [blood pressure] looks like in a couple weeks after [taking that medication]. Okay?\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  All right, thanks Susan.\n[patient]  Thank you.\n[doctor]  Hey, [Dragon], finalize the note.",

So can you tell me what happened to you?\n[patient]  [Yes], I was at a birthday party and it was surprise party. So we were all like crunch behind and hiding.

Any [pain shooting] down your [legs] at all?\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  Is it on one side or the other of your [back]?\n[patient]  um... it's more on the right\n[doctor]  On the right, is there anything that makes it better or [worse]?\n[patient]  If I'm lying flat, it hurts a little more, and any [twisting] [motion] for sure.\n[doctor]  Okay. Alright. And do you have any [history] or any [back problems] before?\n[patient]  I did. I had a fusion done.\n[doctor]  Okay, yeah that lumber fusion. Um, let's take an [x-ray]. Hey. Or let's [look] at an [x-ray]. Hey dragon, show me the latest [x-ray]. Okay, we can [see] where you had your fusion. T4 here on the [x-ray]. But I don't [see] anything that looks, um, significantly [abnormal]. It doesn't appear to have any [compression fractures] or anything like that. So it's essentially except for the fusion and normal exam. Let me do your exam for you here. Can I have you [stand] up please?

So you had to injure it to your [back] when you were [twisting] at the birthday party. [You] don't really have any [pain] or [numbness] down your [legs]. [You] have some [stiffness] with [rotation], but you don't have any evidence of what we would call a [pinch]-nerved or [radiculopathy]. So I [think] you basically have a [strain] of your [lower back]. Have you been taking any [medications]?\n[patient]  Just some [ibuprofen].\n[doctor]  Okay, and do you have any other medical problems?\n[patient]  I might take [medication] for [anxiety].\n[doctor]  Okay, and that's all.

Now I'm wondering if I can tell DAX a little bit about you.\n[patient]  Go for it.\n[doctor]  Okay, so Rebecca is a 27 year old [female patient]. [You] have a [history] of [carpal tunnel]. A release done a couple of years ago, you have some [chronic back pain], some [depression]. Why am I [seeing] you today?\n[patient]  So last week, and over the course of the month, I have taken up [swimming] more regularly.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  I've been trying to get up and get active. And all of a sudden I've been [feeling] some really bad [knee pain].\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  Am I right, me?\n[doctor]  Justin, you're right, me.\n[patient]  Yeah.\n[doctor]  Okay, just when [swimming]. Are you [swimming] freestyle with your [legs] kicking straight or more like breaststroke where your [legs] kick out?\n[patient]  Yeah, it's only while [swimming]. I [used] the breaststroke, so I guess where the [legs] are kicking out like a frog, it kind of starts hurting a little bit after I swim a couple laps, which a month ago when I started I was [able] to do 10.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  But after a couple of laps, it starts to hurt.\n[doctor]  and no [injury], like you didn't [fall] or [twist] it or anything like that that you [remember].\n[patient]  No, not that I can [remember].\n[doctor]  Okay, so just [swimming] a [lot] and you [feeling] more and more [discomfort]?\n[patient]  Yeah.\n[doctor]  Okay, good. So, um, I know my nurse did a review of systems before you [came] in. There were really no significant issues. [You] have a [history] of [chronic back pain]. That's been doing well?\n[patient]  Yeah, it comes and goes, but right now it's doing really well.\n[doctor]  Okay, no [pain] going down your [legs] or anything like that.\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  Okay, and I know you have some [depression]. [You]'ve been on [medication]. How's that been going?\n[patient]  That's been going really well.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  with the [medication] and therapy, and then trying to get outside more has been really helping me.\n[doctor]  [Sleeping] well?\n[patient]  Yeah.\n[doctor]  [Eating] well? Okay. Don't [feel] any concerns about hurting yourself or [others] or anything like that.\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  Okay, good. And you had CA [Carpal] Tunnel Dawn a few years ago. How's that doing?\n[patient]  That's doing.\n[doctor]  Any flare up with that?\n[patient]  That's doing really well. I've been getting full [range of motion] and it's felt a [lot] better.\n[doctor]  Okay, great. Do you [mind] if I do a quick exam?\n[patient]  Yeah, go for it.\n[doctor]  [Squeeze] my [fingers] for me. Good. Okay. Is it [painful] if I [move] your [patella] like that?\n[patient]  Yeah, that hurts.\n[doctor]  Okay, and I'm gonna hold your [leg] out. I'm gonna hold. I want you to stiffen your upper. [Does] that hurt when I do that?\n[patient]  Yeah, that hurts too.\n[doctor]  Okay, good. Alright. Let's take a quick [look] at your [x-ray], okay?\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Hey, dragon, show me the [right knee] [x-ray]. Okay, so here's a picture of your [right knee]. Actually, [normal x-ray], everything looks good, okay? On my exam, you don't really have any [swelling] in your [joints] of your [knee]. [You] have a little [pain] with a [range of motion] of the [knee]. [You] have real [pain] when we do what we call [patella] in [patella] [inhibition], okay? So that's what caused most of that [pain]. So your [heart] is regular, your [lungs] are clear. I don't [feel] any [adenopathy] or [thyroid], normal. Your [grips] are equal. The rest of your exam is essentially normal, okay? So my assessment is you have what we call condromalacia of the [patella], okay? It's just from the overuse and all. All the [swimming] you've been doing, okay? So to treat that we'll just use some anti-inflammatories, go ahead and take some [ibuprofen] 600 milligrams for times a day with [food]. I do want you to do some straight [leg] raising exercises. That'll strengthen your [quadriceps] and that'll help with that [pain], okay?\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Basically, you want to avoid anything that puts extra [pressure] on your [knees] for a little while, and it should be fine. If it's not getting any better in a couple weeks, I want to [see] you again, okay? So no lunges avoid the [breast] [stroke]. If you're comfortable, you can also do other [swimming] [strokes] where your [knees] are straight instead, or you can take the opportunity to have a little break.\n[patient]  All right.\n[doctor]  Your second [problem] is your [chronic back pain]. That's been doing really well. Keep [swimming]. That's okay after this gets better.\n[patient]  Yeah.\n[doctor]  But I [think] that's been under control. But if it flares up go ahead and give me a call, okay?\n[patient]  MM\n[doctor]  Your third [problem] is your [depression]. That's been stable. We're going to keep you on your [current medication]. Not going to change anything at this point, okay? And as far as your [carpal tunnel] goes, that's relatively stable. So no changes there as well, okay? So anything else I can do for you?\n[patient]  No, that's it.\n[doctor]  Okay, well we'll get you checked out.\n[patient]  All right.\n[doctor]  Hey [Dragon], finalize the report.",

How are you?\n[patient]  Good, how are you?\n[doctor]  I'm good. [You] ready to get started?\n[patient]  [Yes], I am.\n[doctor]  So Hannah is a 52 year old [female] here for evaluation of a [high blood sugar]. So Hannah, what how it happened? I heard you were in the [emergency] room with a [high blood sugar].\n[patient]  [Yes], so I've been [eating] a ton of sweets recently. With the holidays, it just [feels] like there is always something [sweet] available. Whether I am at work and there are holiday gift baskets or clients bringing in treats or when I visit my family for the holidays and there is every baked good imaginable. There's always something [sweet] I can be [eating]. In the beginning I felt fine but I have started to [feel] it after a couple of weeks and this past week I just felt really [lightheaded] and I could was [seeing] [spots] really [dizzy]. So I went into the [emergency] room and they [said] I had a [high blood sugar]. So I wanted to come in and follow up with you to get that get checked out.\n[doctor]  Okay, alright. And how are you [feeling] now? Did they did? Did they treat you in the [emergency] room? Did they GI? They give you some for fluids and things like that?\n[patient]  Yeah, they gave me some fluids and they told me just to try to really [cut] out [eating] any extra sweets and get [back] into my normal routine and diet. But I'm still staying with my family and my mom and grandmother are big bakers. So I [think] it will be really hard to get into a routine there. So I just want to make sure I'm nipping this [high blood sugar] thing in the [bud].\n[doctor]  Okay, and I [saw] you went through a review of system sheet with a nurse. I just want to ask you a few more questions from that standpoint, so you have had any [fever] or [chills].\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  any [chest pain] or [shortness of breath].\n[patient]  in or no.\n[doctor]  [abdominal pain].\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  Any [burning] when you urinate?\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  any [joint pain] or [muscle aches].\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  I do have [osteoarthritis] though, so that when I say no, it's not like [nothing] out of the norm.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  For me.\n[doctor]  Perfect. And then I know that you have this [history] of a fib [atrial fibrillation]. Have you felt your [heart] racing at all recently?\n[patient]  Only when I'm really [anxious]. I [feel] it [pumping] a little bit, but other than that I haven't.\n[doctor]  Okay, alright. And how are you doing with your [reflux]?\n[patient]  I've been doing well. I've been [taking the medication] that you prescribed to me and that's been helping a [lot].\n[doctor]  Okay yeah. I [see] here you're on the prognix, 40 milligrams once a day.\n[patient]  [Yes].\n[doctor]  So that's, you're doing well with that.\n[patient]  Yep.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right. So let's go ahead and do a quick physical exam. So [listening] to you, [look] or looking at you, you appear in no [distress]. Your [thyroid] is a little enlarged, but non-tender. There's no [carotid] brutes. Your [heart] is in a regular rate and [rhythm], and your [lungs] are clear. Your [abdomen] is nice and soft, and you have no [edema] in your [lower extremities]. Let's go ahead and [look] at some of your [test results].\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Hey, dragon, show me the [blood sugar]. Hey, dragon, show me the [blood glucose]. Hey, dragon, show me the [hemoglobin] A1c. Okay, so I [see] here that both your [blood sugar] and your [hemoglobin] A1c are elevated. So your [blood sugars] have [probably] been [running] high for [probably] a few months. Okay, let's go ahead and [look] at some of your other results. Hey, dragon, show me the [diabetes] labs. Yeah, okay. Yeah, so my [impression] of you at this time, for your high [blood sugars], that you do have this diagnosis of [diabetes]. Now, we're not sure if it's type I or type II. Even patients in, you know, in their mid-20s can develop type I [diabetes]. So we're going to go off and we're going to go ahead and send some labs to work that up. Hey, dragon, order a complete metabolic panel. And I'd [like] to start you on that form in 500 milligrams twice a day. That will help keep your [blood sugars] down.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Hey, dragon, order met foreman, 500 milligrams, twice a day. And then if some of the autoimmune labs that come [back] show that you have an [autoimmune disorder], meaning that you would have type by [diabetes], then we would have to go ahead and put you on [insulin]. But I'm going to hold off until we have those results, okay?\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  But in the meantime, I really want you to avoid foods high in [sugar]. And the nurse will come in and she'll give you a [glucometer] and teach you how to do [blood sugar] testing. Okay?\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  And then from an [atrial fibrillation] standpoint, your [heart], even though you're an [atrial fibrillation] right now, isn't a good rate. And we'll just continue you on your Metaprolol, 25 milligrams, twice a day. Do you need a refill on that?\n[patient]  [Yes], I do.\n[doctor]  Hey, [Dragon], order a refill on Metaprolol 25 milligrams twice a day. And for your [reflux], we'll just continue you on the Prodynix, okay?\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Do you have any questions, Hannah?\n[patient]  No, not at this time.\n[doctor]  Okay, so the nurse will come in and she'll go over all that stuff with you.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Take [care].\n[patient]  Thank you.\n[doctor]  Hey [Dragon], finalize the note.",

What what [joint]'s been bothering you Janet?\n[patient]  It's been mostly my [knees] actually. I've been doing more stair type workouts, which I thought was building [muscle] on my [knees] and supposed to help.\n[doctor]  NEXT\n[patient]  But in [turn], it really hasn't, so my [knees] have been really bothering me.\n[doctor]  Okay, alright. And is it one [knee] versus the other? Or both equally?\n[patient]  It's both equally.\n[doctor]  Okay. And have you been having any other [joint pain] like elbows or [shoulder] or anything like that?\n[patient]  No, but I should mention that [like], I had a [rotator cuff] [repair] about two years ago.\n[doctor]  Mhmm. No\n[patient]  uh... but i haven't had any problems since that point\n[doctor]  Okay, and what [shoulder] was that?\n[patient]  That was my [right shoulder].\n[doctor]  Okay, all right.

There's no [enlarged thyroid]. Your [heart] has a regular rate and [rhythm]. Your [lungs] are clear. Your [abdomen] is nice and soft.

Hey, dragon, order an autoimmune profile. And then from a [hypertension] standpoint, you, because your [blood pressure] is a little elevated today, I'd [like] you to continue to [monitor] it at home.

I really haven't had any issues with it, and I take it once in a morning and once at night.\n[doctor]  And that's one puff twice a day.\n[patient]  MM\n[doctor]  Okay, and have you been having to use your [Albuterol] [inhaler] at all?\n[patient]  Rarely and if I do it's really just before a workout or something out that if I know I'm really going to be pushing it\n[doctor]  So it [sounds] like it's around strenuous activity.\n[patient]  [Yes].\n[doctor]  Okay, so you can do things [like] go on a walk or go into the grocery store no [problem] and just use it for more [exertional] stuff.\n[patient]  [Yes], like if I'm gonna go for a [run] or something like that, I'll really just take it before as a preventive.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  And I've been trying to use my daily if I can a little less because I'm trying to go into the military soon.\n[doctor]  No kidding, that's great.\n[patient]  Yeah, so I have to be [able] to operate basically at a certain fitness level without an [inhaler].\n[doctor]  Really?\n[patient]  Yeah, and if I can prove that I'm capable of these [activities] without an [inhaler], it makes it easier.\n[doctor]  And so by [inhaler] do they mean both your daily and rescue [inhalers]?\n[patient]  MM, so it's like they'll have a fitness [test] and basically they'll tell me not to take my [inhaler] that day before the [test] and then they'll [see] how the [asthma] affects me and they're looking to [see] if it's serious enough to hold me [back] from joining or whatever. So I've been taking it less and less and really some days I [feel] like I don't need it.\n[doctor]  And that is the wicksela that you're not taking. So on average per week, how many days of the week do you use one puff in the morning and one puff at night?\n[patient]  [Probably] about three or four.\n[doctor]  Okay, three to four days per week and the other days it's once a day?\n[patient]  [Yes], that's correct.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  and it's either in the morning or at night that I'm taking it.\n[doctor]  Okay, and do you [think] that's working okay?\n[patient]  I do.\n[doctor]  Great! And any urgent [care] or visits at all for [breathing] over the past year.\n[patient]  Nope.\n[doctor]  Okay, so I'm going to assume no one has put you on [prednisone] for [breathing] issues then.\n[patient]  Nope.\n[doctor]  Okay, and now, military [wise], what's the time [frame] of when you'll be completing some of these exorstional tests? [Like], what are your next steps?\n[patient]  So hopefully I'm going to be enlisted early spring of 2022. So that gives me about six to seven months to get to a point where I'm [able] to [exert] my [body] where I don't really need the [inhaler]. Or at least show them that I have it under control.\n[doctor]  Now when you were in the other room, you completed a [breathing] [test] correct?\n[patient]  [Correct].\n[doctor]  Okay, great. So now let me ask you about the [allergies], because I know typically you'll use the Zerteck in the spring, summer and [fall], correct?\n[patient]  Yeah, I don't really, or I'm sorry, I use it mortar and spring and [fall]. I don't really have to use it too much in the summer.\n[doctor]  Do you use it more just as kneaded in the summer?\n[patient]  Yeah, that's right.\n[doctor]  Okay, and have you been taking the Zertek every day recently since you're riding the mix of spring?\n[patient]  Not every day, but I do take it on days I know I'm going to be outside a [lot]. I do tend to work outside about three days a week, so I'll definitely take it on those days.\n[doctor]  And does it seem to work pretty well still? Are you [happy] with it?\n[patient]  Yeah, it does it works great.\n[doctor]  Wonderful, good to [hear]. And then I'm assuming you're staying away from the peanuts. Last year you had told me it worked with, you worked with Enterprise Renacar, and one of the cars had a [lot] of peanuts in it that you were cleaning out, and that gave you [hives]. When you had touched it, is that correct?\n[patient]  Yep, that's correct.\n[doctor]  Okay, and has there been anything like that since that [experience]?\n[patient]  No, I don't [think] so. I definitely became more cautious after that. So I usually wear long sleeves and change my gloves every time now. So I haven't had a reaction, but I imagine that I [probably] [came] in a [contact] with cars that had peanuts in them, but they just didn't [touch] my [skin].\n[doctor]  Super and it [sounds] like you're really smart about it\n[patient]  Yeah, and the airplanes, they have peanuts. They give everyone two, so...\n[doctor]  Okay, and you have an epic pen that K that you keep with you, correct?\n[patient]  [Yes].\n[doctor]  Okay, and I'm assuming you're going to need refills. Um, I can call you in a [new] [set] for the year. Typically, of course, they expire within a year.\n[patient]  Yeah, okay.\n[doctor]  And I [remember], um, sometime previously you've had some testing for tree nuts, but you do have almonds and cashews, correct? And, and you do okay with them, or do you avoid all tree nuts?\n[patient]  I do tend to avoid all of them, but I [recall] [eating] some almonds at one point, really soon after we discussed, I might not be allergic to tree nuts anymore.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  And I [remember] having them and [nothing] happened, but I usually just tend to stay away from them, um, really if I can help it.\n[doctor]  Okay, so sometimes when people have a [peanut allergy], the nuts in general just aren't very important to them. So it is very common to avoid both. So let's do this. I'll have Helen come in and I would [love] to complete a [breathing] [test] on you. If your [breathing] numbers are looking great, we can work on getting you something lower than Wixula. If you [look] at all of our [asthma] regimens, it is a stepwise process and Wixula is a combination of two [medications] in one. And well maybe you don't need both of them. [Maybe] you just need one of them. So we can work our way backwards.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  And so the [breathing] [test] will help give us some more [guidance]. We will [look] at the results in just a moment.\n[patient]  All right, and so this past year I did get into the bad habit of vaping and smoking, but I've been trying to [cut] that out. So I should be good, and now I only do just a little bit, and I'm trying to quit. So I'm sure that might have an [effect].\n[doctor]  It can. So, what we can do today is compare your results with prior results [probably] before you [started smoking] or using the vape.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Yeah, and we'll [see] where you [stand] at that point.\n[patient]  Alright, that [sounds] good.\n[doctor]  [Well], let me go ahead and [listen]. So hop on up here for me.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Alright, so your [ears] [look] good, a little bit of [wax] on both sides. Can I [see] inside your [mouth]? Big A.\n[patient]  Ah\n[doctor]  Good. Okay, let me take a peek in your [nose]. All right, good. [You] can put your [mask] [back] on.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  And go ahead, take a big breath in and out. Good. Your [lungs sound] terrific. I'll [listen] to your [heart]. Breathe quietly. Okay, very good.\n[patient]  Awesome!\n[doctor]  So your [breathing] [test] is about the same as it was a couple years ago and actually looks a little bit better. [You] may not [remember], but when we last completed the [test] in 2019, do you [recall] if you were [feeling] lousy at the time?\n[patient]  I [think] it was the [smoke]. There were so many [fires] at that point and I [remember] coming in and looking out the window and all you [saw] was the [orange] and the [smoke].\n[doctor]  [Yes], you're absolutely right. That was a bad year. That was my first [fall] here, and I was really [alarmed]. [Well], that explains why at that time your numbers were a little bit lower, and today they [look] better. Here's what I [think], so you'll have Kaiser currently, correct?\n[patient]  [Correct].\n[doctor]  Okay, most insurances do limit what we can use.\n[patient]  Yeah, I do know that.\n[doctor]  Okay, so option one would be to continue using Wixilla, like you're using it now. We would classify it as off-label and you can use it once a day instead of twice a day, which is fine. Some people do that because they just need it once a day, so that's an option. Option two would be to actually [back] up to an [inhaler] that just has one med.\n[patient]  MM\n[doctor]  So the one that Kaiser covers is [Alvesco]. The thing about [Alvesco], though, is that it would be two puffs in the morning and two puffs at night. So it's a bit more work. It's not breath activated, but we could step down the lowest dose to [see] how you do. Some of the newer guidelines for [asthma] that were published this year is recommending trying to treat people with [inhalers] like wixula or [Alvesco] only when you're [ill] or say during [smoke] season. So minimizing their use to those [periods] of time versus all year, unless you found out that you're getting. Inaudible nine minutes and 25 seconds sick having issues every month, then that would indicate would [pull] [back] too much.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  that we had too much, yeah.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  So we could step [back] and possibly get you to the point where you just use those [inhalers] when you're [ill] or at [smoke] season, but at the first step to do any of that would be to try to drop down to just alvesco.\n[patient]  Okay, that actually [sounds] really good.\n[doctor]  Okay great. So I will call that in for you. It will be the lower dose 80 micrograms and you'll have to do two puffs twice a day.\n[patient]  Alright.\n[doctor]  Okay, and that'll be on the box when I call it in. [You] can put the [wicks]-[ill] off to the side, but don't [throw] it away just in case the alvesco doesn't work well for you.\n[patient]  Okay, [got] it.\n[doctor]  And then ideally we would repeat your [breathing] [test] in four months to [see] how you're doing and then be [able] to document that you're doing well. Sometimes not always, the military will require documentation on [breathing] tests.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Is your pharmacy still the same or did you update it with Helen?\n[patient]  Ya believe she updated it. It should be Kaiser Permanente Broadway.\n[doctor]  Okay, perfect. I'll make sure it's the alvesco and then I'll renew your [albuterol] and epipan as well.\n[patient]  Awesome, thank you.\n[doctor]  [You]'re welcome. Uh, then the ZerTech. Do you pick it up over the counter or do you get it as a prescription?\n[patient]  I just get over the counter.\n[doctor]  Okay, [got] it. And do you have a [nebulizer] that you would need refills on?\n[patient]  I don't [think] I need any refills. I haven't [used] that in such a long time. I [think] the last time was when I had [bronchitis] or there was few select times when I had to use it when I was a kid.\n[doctor]  Okay good. [Well] I [think] we have our game plan.\n[patient]  Okay, awesome.\n[doctor]  and do the Elvesco 2 puffs twice a day. And you're all butyl if you need it. The Zertek 10 milligrams as you need it and continue to stay away from peanuts and tree nuts and I'll refill your EpiPen.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Alright, so we've [got] it.\n[patient]  Great!\n[doctor]  I'll write I'll have you take this to the front and I'm going to say four months recheck for [asthma] and we'll repeat the [spirometer] spirometry at that time\n[patient]  Okay, [sounds] good.\n[doctor]  Alright well thanks so much and you have a great day.\n[patient]  [You] too.\n[doctor]  And we'll do a follow up in four months with [ACT] and SPYROMATRY, sooner if needed. Follow up 25 minutes.",
            "tgt": "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nFollow-up for asthma, allergic rhinitis, and food allergy.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nEmily Hernandez is a 20-year-old female presenting today for an annual follow-up for asthma, allergic rhinitis, and food allergy. Due to insurance changes during the interim of our last office appointment from 04/2020, she was switched from Symbicort to Wixela. She uses Zyrtec in the spring, summer, and fall for her seasonal allergy symptoms, which tends to work well. She has known peanut and tree nut allergies, which she tries to avoid. She does tolerate almonds and cashew.\n\nMrs. Hernandez is trying to join the military, who require a certain fitness level without use of a rescue or maintenance inhaler, so she has been weaning off her inhalers. She uses albuterol prior to a run, but otherwise functions without it. She has been reducing her Wixela dose, using 1 inhalation once daily 3 times per week, with remaining days using it twice per day as prescribed. She feels this is working well. She denies urgent care or emergency room visits for respiratory issues in the past year. She denies requiring prednisone for breathing issues in the past year.\n\nShe hopes to be enlisted in the military in early spring of 2022. She is currently undergoing exertional testing to this purpose. She explains that this gives hers 6 to 7 months to show that she can exert herself without needing any inhalers.\n\nOver the past year, she admits to vaping and smoking, though she is trying to quit and has cut down her use significantly.\n\nShe notes having a nebulizer but denies needing it recently and has only used it in her past for upper respiratory infections and as a child a few times.\n\nMrs. Hernandez uses Zyrtec during the spring and fall but does not typically have to use it consistently during the summer. She confirms she has been taking Zyrtec 3 days per week when she works outside, and it works well to control her symptoms.\n\nShe has been successfully avoiding peanuts. Incident from last year was reviewed where she was exposed to peanuts when she was cleaning an Enterprise rental car that had a lot of peanuts in it. She developed contact hives when the peanuts encountered her skin. Over the past year she denies additional accidental exposures. She wears long sleeves and changes her gloves between each cleaning. She thinks it is likely that she has been in contact with cars that contained peanuts, but due to her protective measures she did not touch them directly. She confirmed she always keeps an EpiPen with her.\n\nThe patient is also avoiding tree nuts. She did ingest almonds without issue following our discussion that she could try them. Despite tolerating them well, she continues to avoid all tree nuts.\n\nPAST HISTORY\n\nMedical\nAsthma.\nAllergy rhinitis.\nFood allergies to peanut and tree nuts.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nCurrently smokes tobacco and vapes, trying to reduce and interested in cessation in preparation for joining the army.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS\n\nWixela Inhub 250 mcg-50 mcg/dose powder for inhalation. 1 puff 2 times daily in the morning and evening.\nProair HFA as needed.\nEpiPen as needed.\nAlvesco 80 mcg 2 puff 2 times daily.\n\nALLERGIES\n\nPeanuts cause a severe, anaphylactic reaction.\nMontelukast sodium, \u201cseizure-like\u201d reaction.\n\nRESULTS\n\nAsthma Control Test (ACT) Results: ACT score is 21.\nCurrent food skin test sensitivities include peanuts.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\n\u2022 Moderate persistent asthma, uncomplicated.\n\u2022 Allergic rhinitis.\n\u2022 Anaphylactic reaction due to peanuts.\n\nEmily Hernandez is a 20-year-old female who presented today for her yearly follow-up appointment for asthma, allergic rhinitis, and food allergy.\n\nPLAN\n\nModerate persistent asthma, uncomplicated\nThe patient has been using Wixela inhaler daily and admits to reducing her daily dose to one puff per day, 3-4 days per week as she feels she does not always need it the full dose. Additionally, she aspires to join the military and she must meet certain physical fitness requirements without the use of her inhaler. I counseled the patient on current asthma treatment guidelines which recommend using Wixela and Alvesco only when needed during periods of illness. The patient agreed to reducing her medicine to Alvesco which is a single medication, versus 2 in Welixa. The patient will continue to use her albuterol inhaler as needed. Her ACT score is 21 today and her spirometry test today was better than it was in 2019, though she recalls that it was smoky from wildfires during her last breathing test.\n\nAllergic rhinitis\nShe will continue to use Zyrtec as needed, primarily during spring and fall and sometimes in summer. Her current dose cadence is 3 times per week when she works outside. Symptoms are currently under control.\n\nAnaphylactic reaction due to peanuts\nThe patient has successfully avoided peanuts. Plan is to continue with current methods to avoid exposure. I will refill her EpiPen which expires annually.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nModerate persistent asthma, uncomplicated\nStart Alvesco, 2 puffs twice daily. Keep Wixela in case Alvesco does not work well. Continue albuterol as needed. Return in 4 months to repeat ACT and spirometry testing.\n\nAllergic rhinitis\nContinue Zyrtec 10 mg daily as needed.\n\nAnaphylactic reaction due to peanuts\nContinue strict avoidance of peanuts. I will refill her EpiPen today.",

Please copy forward his [thyroid] profile from March 1st, 2021.\n[doctor]  Hello Mr. Roberts, how are you doing today?\n[patient]  I'm fine, thank you.\n[doctor]  Good. Good. So, I [saw] you were recently in the [emergency] room with [high blood pressure] and some competitions.\n[patient]  Yeah, that was [back] in March, I [think], but my girlfriend and I, we talked about it. And on that day, I had a few cups of coffee and no breakfast. So, I [think] it was [probably] more of a [panic attack] than anything else.\n[doctor]  Yeah, have you felt it again since?\n[patient]  Oh no.\n[doctor]  Okay, so tell me about the [blood pressure] then.\n[patient]  [Well], I've had issues with my [blood pressure] since I was young.\n[doctor]  Do you have a [family history] of this?\n[patient]  Yeah, a [lot] of my family does have [high blood pressure].\n[doctor]  I [see].\n[patient]  Yeah, I thought it was getting better and I have a [new] [primary] doctor and she put me on a [new] [medication] about a month ago.\n[doctor]  Uh, can you tell me which [medications] are taking?\n[patient]  My [new] med is a combo med something 40 to 25.\n[doctor]  Okay. Um, [yes], I [see] that in your [chart]. The Benacar HCT. It has [hydrochlorothiazide] in it.\n[patient]  Yeah, that's it. My [water] [pill] I call it.\n[doctor]  Okay. Are you still taking the emlodipine? 10 milligrams daily?\n[patient]  [Yes], I am.\n[doctor]  That's a good start on a regimen. Are you checking your [blood pressure] at home? And if [yes], what numbers are you [seeing]?\n[patient]  um every day.\n[doctor]  Awesome!\n[patient]  Yeah, every morning I take it when I get up and it's been [running] at about 146 to 155 lately.\n[doctor]  So, you're not down in the 120's yet?\n[patient]  No, not yet. [Well], we're trying to get there though.\n[doctor]  Okay. Uh, how are you doing with your [salt intake]?\n[patient]  I'm trying to [back] off of it. I [think] I'm doing good with it, not [eating] too much.\n[doctor]  Good. It [plays] a huge part in lowering your [pressure] and staying away from [salt] is important. I'll give you some information on the dash [eating] plan, which is the only [eating] plan that has been shown to [lower blood pressure].\n[patient]  [Sound] good.\n[doctor]  Are you doing any exercise?\n[patient]  I do try to walk on the treadmill when I can.\n[doctor]  Okay, great. Oh, alright. So, let's take a [look].\n[patient]  All right.\n[doctor]  [You]'re going to [hear] me [talk] throughout your exam just so I can make sure I get everything documented.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  So, use my general physical exam [template]. Let me take a [listen] to you and make sure everything [sounds] good.\n[patient]  All right.\n[doctor]  Your [heart] and [lungs sound] good, so that's great.\n[patient]  Good to [hear].\n[doctor]  Alright, go ahead and lie down. Uh, and let me know if anywhere I press Hertz.\n[patient]  Nope. No where.\n[doctor]  Alright, so I'm going to take a [look] at your [ankles] and [feet]. I'm just going to [look] for some [swelling].\n[patient]  All right.\n[doctor]  All right, it all looks good. Go ahead and [sit] up. So in terms of getting that [pressure] down, you're on three meds that are maxed out and your [blood pressure] is still not down. And the question is what do we need to do to get your to get it down? Your [potassium] one week ago was 4.0. Has it been redone since in the last week?\n[patient]  Oh no.\n[doctor]  Okay. For as good for your [potassium level], some people have what is called resistant [hypertension] that is driven by something else in their [body]. Often it is a form, a hormonal [response]. If I were to take 10 people under the [age] of 50 who have [high blood pressure], who developed it at a young [age], 8 out of 10 would respond to reduce [salt] in their diet with a [lower blood pressure]. But for the 2 out of 10, there is something else driving it, a [parathyroid] levels, or something called your [adrenal glands] over produce, [aldosterone], which we call hyper [aldosterone].\n[patient]  Okay, so is there something we can do about it?\n[doctor]  In these cases, there's medicine called a spironylactone that is very effective at dropping the [ALD] [aldosterone level] and your [blood pressure] and I [think] we should give that a try.\n[patient]  Alright, I mean, I'm [willing] to give it a try.\n[doctor]  Okay, so let's discuss the piss, the [possible] risk of being on [hydrochlorothiazide], which is the fluid med that you're now on, and the spironal actone. One issue is that they can [affect] your [electrolyte balance]. They can also cause [dehydration]. So when so you [got] to make sure that you [hydrate]. If you do not [hydrate] and you get dehydrated, you will know it because you will get [dizzy standing] up. Second thing is the spironal actone can raise your [potassium] too far. It's rare, but it can. [You]'re starting with your [potassium] at four, so that gives us some room.\n[patient]  Alright, I guess that makes me [feel] a little bit better.\n[doctor]  Yeah. And then the third thing is that spironal aceton combined with hydrochlorazide, [chlorothiazide], can cause your [sodium] levels to go down. Now, this does not mean that you need to be [eating] more [salt], okay? But it does mean that you will need to do [blood] tests in two weeks to make sure that it's okay.\n[patient]  All right, no, that I can do. Um, are there any other [side effects] I need to [worry] about?\n[doctor]  Uh, [dizziness] possibly, as well as, uh, one in 100 guys might develop [tenderness] in their [chest], [swollen] [breasts], or [enlarged breasts]. This is a rare [side effect], um, called [gynecomastia]. And if it happens, you just [cut] the [medication] and you let me know, but it is very uncommon.\n[patient]  I'll definitely let you know if that happens.\n[doctor]  Okay, we'll keep working at it until your [blood pressure] gets better. It can be tricky when your [blood pressure] starts to go up at a young [age] though. It is important to get it under control because it can [lead] to your [heart] getting bigger or enlarged. Same thing that happens when you [lift] weights and your [muscles] get bigger. And if your [heart] [pumps] against [high blood pressure], it can eventually [lead] to [heart failure].\n[patient]  I [understand].\n[doctor]  Yeah, so getting that under control is really important to help prevent [kidney failure], [strokes], and things like that that you're at [high risk] for with [high blood pressure].\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  The American [Heart] [Association] has a website called heart.org. It has a [lot] of really good information about [blood pressure] to teach, to teach you about it, and how to control your diet with exercise. If you do your treadmill routinely for 30 minutes or so most days, that could be seven to ten points off your [blood pressure].\n[patient]  Really? I didn't realize that.\n[doctor]  Yeah, yeah. It's very important to be active, lower your [salt], and increase your [potassium]. The goal is to keep your [salt] under 2000 milligrams a day. The actual recommendation is, is 1500 milligrams per day, but most people have a hard time with that. So just take a [look] at the website and the dash diet information. That will give you a [lot] of tips and information to help you start [learning] about this stuff.\n[patient]  Okay, I'll definitely check that out.\n[doctor]  All right, so we'll try this for on a [lactone] and schedule a follow up in two weeks to check your [blood pressure] and [electrolytes]. If the [new] med doesn't work, the next step is going to be the resistant [hypertension] clinic.\n[patient]  All right.\n[doctor]  All right, so they will [look] into [secondary] causes of your [hypertension]. They have access to newer procedure-based technologies that can lower your [blood pressure] without [medication]. For example, there is something called a [renal] [denervation] where they go inside the [artery] that feeds your [kidney] with almost [like] a little coil and [heat] that [artery] up. When they do that, they can [block] the [nerve endings] that get into your [kidneys] and lower your [blood pressure].\n[patient]  That's [interesting].\n[doctor]  Yeah, so that procedure has been shown to [lower blood pressure] by 10 points. There are of course some risks, so not everyone is a candidate, but we'll cross that road when we need to, and let's just [see] how you do with the addition of the [medication].\n[patient]  [Sounds] good to me.\n[doctor]  Alright, so we will [see] you in two weeks then.\n[patient]  [Sound] good. Thanks, Doc.\n[doctor]  Yeah, you're welcome. Let me know if you have any questions.\n[patient]  \ubb50 do\n[doctor]  All right, have a great day, Mr. Roberts.\n[patient]  [You] too.\n[doctor]  Mr. Roberts presents with resistant [hypertension]. He's on three meds and maximum dose. I have added spironalactone to his regimen. We will need to [monitor] his [potassium] and [sodium]. He will have a metabolic panel and [blood pressure] check in two weeks. Next [medication] would be [carvedilol], which I try to avoid giving. It's potential for [erectile dysfunction]. I have talked to the patient about that, and the potential [side effects] of spironalactone, including the [gynecomastia] and [electrolyte] disturbances. If he is not controlled on spironalactone, the next step would be sending him to resistant [hypertension] clinic.",

He also walks on his treadmill as often as he can.\n\nHe has a new primary care physician who started him on a new medication Benicar HCT, which he has been using for the past month.\n\nPAST HISTORY\n\nMedical\nHypertension.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY\n\nSeveral family members positive for hypertension.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS\n\nBenicar HCT 40 mg/25 mg\nAmlodipine 10 mg daily.\n\nPhysical Examination\n\nCardiovascular\nNormal rate, regular rhythm, S2 normal, normal heart sounds, and normal pulses.\n\nPulmonary/Chest\nBreath sounds normal. \n\nAbdominal\nThere is no tenderness.\n\nMusculoskeletal\nThere is no edema.\n\nRESULTS\n\nThyroid profile 03/01/2021.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\n\u2022 Resistant hypertension.\n\nMr. Roberts presents with resistant hypertension, with systolic blood pressure readings between 146-155. He is currently on maximal doses for 3 medications.\n\nPLAN\n\nI have added spironolactone to his regimen which will require monitoring of his potassium and sodium. We will schedule him for a follow up in 2 weeks to complete a basic metabolic panel and check his blood pressure. Next medication to consider adding is carvedilol. I have tried to avoid this, given the potential for issues with erectile dysfunction. I counseled the patient about spironolactone side effects, including gynecomastia and electrolyte disturbances, as well as his increased risk of dehydration, with one sign to watch for being dizziness. If we are not able to improve his blood pressure with spironolactone, the next step would be sending him to the resistant hypertension clinic.\n\nI provided and reviewed with Mr. Roberts the American Heart association website (heart.org) and encouraged him to access for tips on lowering his salt intake and increasing his potassium intake. His maximum salt intake should be 1500 to <2000 mg per day. He was provided materials to follow the DASH diet and encouraged to meet 30-min of walking most days.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nSchedule follow up appointment in 2 weeks for blood pressure check and basic metabolic panel. Reduce sodium intake to 1500 to <2000 mg per day. Follow DASH diet.\n",

            "src": "[doctor]  Brittany [Edwards], 07, 1898. She's a return visit for IBS with functional [abdominal pain], [nausea] [vomiting]. And that's, [Edwards] is a pleasant, 32-year-old [female] who was last seen in August of 2019 with flares of [abdominal pain], who was diagnosed with [irritable] bowl that was treated with bento.\n[doctor]  She had a previous prescription for Reglin that she received from the [emergency] room that she [used] as needed for [nausea]. She was instructed to start a low-dose [fiber] supplement, such as Citricel, [Daily], Probiotics to help with [gas] and [bloating], bent a [lot] to four times daily for [intestinal] [cramping] and stop Reglin and [used] [Zofran] as needed. [Neuromodulators] such as Eleville and Bussper were discussed, but not started.\n[doctor]  Hello, how are you?\n[patient]  I'm okay.\n[doctor]  Good. How have you been [feeling]?\n[patient]  Not so good.\n[doctor]  Yeah, so my nurse told me you've been going out to eat some on Friday nights and Saturday nights and that you have had some spicy foods or spicy [shrimp].\n[patient]  Yeah, I have.\n[doctor]  Okay, well, your [gut] [probably] does not always appreciate that.\n[patient]  No, it doesn't [like] it at all.\n[doctor]  Yeah, so IBS is one of those things where you're very sensitive to certain things such as spicy foods or fatty foods and [alcohol]. And this can cause lower belly stuff like [cramps] or you can get up or belly stuff such as [nausea].\n[patient]  I've been getting both.\n[doctor]  Okay. Um, so how frequently have you been getting or having a [bowel movement] on normal days?\n[patient]  I'm starting to notice it's between two and three times a day.\n[doctor]  Okay. And are they [soft stools] or form [stools]?\n[patient]  um... they're formed\n[doctor]  Okay, and after you've gone out either [drinking] with your friends, do you tend to have more [diarrhea]?\n[patient]  Yeah, I do.\n[doctor]  Okay. Do you [feel] it's the [food] or the [alcohol] or both?\n[patient]  Uh, well usually go to Friday's restaurant. I always eat pasta, the chicken alfredo.\n[doctor]  Okay, I can ask. I can [bet] it's the Alfredo sauce.\n[patient]  But it normally doesn't bother me.\n[doctor]  Okay. [Well], pasta can make you bloated, but it doesn't usually cause [diarrhea]. Grilled chicken is usually all right. Alfredo, though, is higher in [fat], and it does contain dairy. But you're saying it usually doesn't bother you?\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  Okay. What type of [alcohol] drink do you drink when you are there? Is it a [sweet] drink?\n[patient]  Most of the time it's either tequila or dark [liquor]. I prefer patron, but if I get brown [liquor], I only get two. Um, every now and again, I'll drink a martini.\n[doctor]  Sometimes it's the mixer they tend to put in the drinks, but it can be a variety of things. So when you're not [eating] out or [drinking], what we do on a daily basis does help keep us regular. So when it does flare up, it's [see], it might not be as bad. Have you had any luck using the [fiber] like [citric] [cell] regularly?\n[patient]  Oh no, I guess I need to find a [new] drink.\n[doctor]  Okay. And how is it during the week?\n[patient]  Like what I eat.\n[doctor]  Yeah, and with the [diarrhea] and [abdominal pain].\n[patient]  Right now I'm still having the [cramping] and sharp [pains], so I've been avoiding heavy foods. I did have some fried chicken today though.\n[doctor]  and was everything all right after that?\n[patient]  Yeah, for the most part.\n[doctor]  Okay, [remember] it's also the portion sizes. So I mean if you eat a little and you [feel] fine, then that's okay. [You] have to just really watch the portions.\n[patient]  Okay good. I can't go out, go without some fried chicken at least once in a while.\n[doctor]  [Sounds] good. Alright, well let's take a [look] at you today and we'll do a brief physical exam. [You] will [hear] me call out some findings. I will answer any questions and we will discuss once we have finished the exam.\n[patient]  [Sound] good.\n[doctor]  Alright, so the patient is [alert] and cooperative, appears state at [age]. Alright, I'm going to [listen] to your [heart] and [lungs], and [lungs] are clear to your hospitalization bilaterally. [Heart regular] rate and [rhythm]. Alright, so if you could just lay [back] for me, and I'll examine your [abdomen].\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  All right. Do you have any [tenderness]?\n[patient]  [No, not really].\n[doctor]  Okay, so the [abdomen] is soft, non-tender. No masses or organomethally. And let me take a [listen]. [Normal] active vowel [sounds]. All right, you can go ahead and [sit] up now. Thank you.\n[doctor]  All right, so first I want you to try citricil. It does come in a [tablet]. [You] should use it twice daily for regularity. Then I would say if you know you're going out and will possibly have [diarrhea] as a result, you can go ahead and use your bentel 20 milligrams. [You] can do one [tablet] before you eat and then repeat up to four times daily. And then on days when you [feel] good, you don't have to use anything. And then on Friday before you leave the house, you can take a bentel and put one in your pocket for later. And then you can repeat the same thing on Saturday if you want. And that will be totally fine.\n[patient]  Okay, that [sounds] good.\n[doctor]  Okay, and so you're bento, that's the anti-[spasm] [medication], and I would take the higher dose.\n[patient]  Can I refill of that?\n[doctor]  [Yes], absolutely. Uh, so take one [tablet] about 30 to 45 minutes before leaving the house, and then the second [tablet] at the restaurant. Then with the [nausea], I [think] we should try and [see] if you can recognize a pattern with what you're [eating] and [drinking], um, about, [like], what makes it [worse].\n[patient]  Yeah, I noticed I've been doing better with [drinking] [water] instead of sodas.\n[doctor]  Okay, good. And then for your [Zofran], I wouldn't take that ahead of time. Just plan on [drinking] plenty of [water].\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Okay, and you can take it, but before you do, we want to try to reduce the [triggers]. So watch out for greasy or fatty foods and sugary drinks.\n[patient]  Okay, I can do that.\n[doctor]  Okay. And so, however, if it is not just these isolated in-sea incidents and the [symptoms] are happening all the time, we could put you on a long-term [medication] that would take, that you would take every night. And so then you don't have to use so much bento or the [zofran]. How do you [feel] about that?\n[patient]  I was actually going to ask you about something like that to help avoid flares altogether.\n[doctor]  Yeah, there is. And it actually works on the [chemicals] in your [brain] that are causing your [gut] to be overly sensitive. One is called elevel, but the only drawback is that it can make you a little [sleepy]. How does that [sound]?\n[patient]  That [sounds] like a much better plan.\n[doctor]  Okay great, we can definitely do that. Uh, just take it every night before bedtime.\n[patient]  Okay, that [sounds] good. Thank you so much.\n[doctor]  [You]'re welcome. And so I've gone ahead and sent your prescriptions to your pharmacy. Just give us a call if you have any questions or need us for anything else. And then let's plan on touching [base] through my card email in about a month to just check in to [see] how you're doing with [symptoms]. Okay?\n[patient]  Okay, that [sounds] good. Thank you.\n[doctor]  [You]'re welcome, and have a good rest of your day.\n[doctor]  So, review of [symptoms] is [positive] for [diarrhea], [nausea], and [abdominal pain]. Assessment and plan. Brittany [Edwards] is a pleasant [female] with IBS and functional [abdominal pain], [aggravated] by high [stress], poor [eating] [habits], and poor [sleeping] [habits]. I've encouraged dietary and lifestyle modifications, as well as starting a [neuromodulator] such as Eleville 25 milligrams at bedtime for IBS.\n[doctor]  She can use [bentyl] 20 milligrams as needed 30 to 45 minutes prior to [eating] out at a restaurant. She can also use [zofran] if needed. However, I have encouraged her to reduce greasy and fatty foods and [alcohol] consumption. I have asked her to follow up in one month by emailing over my cart regarding any [side effects] and issues, or issues with eleval, or if adjustments are needed.",

            "src": "[doctor]  Okay, so our next patient is Christopher Watson. [Date] of [birth] April 12th, 1934. Mr. Watson is an 86-year-old [male] who returns and follow-up for adult [hydrocephalus]. This is his first visit since undergoing SH [Shunt] Surgery. Excuse me on August 1st, 2020.\n[doctor]  I have followed Mr. Watson since [May] of 2020 when he first presented with eight to ten years of progressive gate [impairment], [cognitive impairment], and [decreased] [bladder control]. We established a diagnosis of adult [hydrocephalus] with a Spino [catheter] protocol in June 2020 and he underwent [shunt] [surgery] on August 1, 2020. A metronics straight up programmable [shunt] in the [ventricular] [peritoneal] configuration was programmed at a level 2.0 was placed.\n[doctor]  Good morning, mister. What's in? Who is the nice lady you have with you today?\n[patient]  Hi Doc, this is my daughter Teresa. She's the one who helps me keep things straight.\n[doctor]  Mr. Watson, have you been sick or been [hospitalized] since your shoe? [Shunt] [surgery] three months ago.\n[patient]  Uh, not that I [recall].\n[patient]  No, he hasn't. He has been doing much better.\n[doctor]  Good, I'm glad to [hear] that.\n[doctor]  Before [surgery], you were having some progressive problems that affected your [walking], [thinking], and [bladder control]. Are these [symptoms] better, [worse], or [unchanged]?\n[patient]  [His] [walking] has [improved]. He's now [able] to walk to the dining room just fine. But he could not do that before [surgery]. He still has times where I have to help him.\n[doctor]  That's impressive, Mr. Watson.\n[patient]  Yeah, I guess.\n[patient]  Now his [bladder control] did improve some after [surgery], but now seems to have leveled out. So he is [wearing diapers].\n[doctor]  No issues with sores from wearing the diaper and any [decreased] or [painful urination].\n[patient]  No, not at all.\n[doctor]  And how about [cognition]?\n[patient]  I [think] I'm better. I don't [feel] lost when talking to someone anymore.\n[patient]  Dad and I both [think] my sister, Hannah, summarized it best. She [said], I [feel] like I can have a normal conversation with him again.\n[doctor]  That's so wonderful. Now have you had any [headaches] or [pain] where the [shunt] is?\n[patient]  No, it hasn't bothered me one bit.\n[doctor]  Okay, and any [pain] in your belly at all?\n[patient]  can't say that I have.\n[doctor]  Okay, [sounds] like you have been improving. Alrighty, Mr. What's in? I'm going to step out of the room while my resident comes in to do a few tests for me. Is that all right?\n[patient]  [Sound] good.\n[doctor]  Okay, I'm going to go out and review the CT scan you had last month, and then we'll [chat] about it when I come in.\n[doctor]  Alrighty, Mr. Watson. So you definitely have made some improvements since the [shunt] [surgery]. Now on CT, Skendou, I do believe I [see] a tiny bit of [blood] fluid collection in the [right parietal region]. Now, I don't believe that that's causing any [symptoms] and I. It actually wasn't documented by the radiologist when he read the CT scan.\n[patient]  So what does that mean?\n[doctor]  Just that I would [like] to leave the [shunt] [set] for another two to three months before we go in changing it. [Like] I [said], if you're not having any [headaches] or [pain] and you have [improved], so that's all good for me. So really there's, there's [nothing] to [worry] about.\n[patient]  Alright, so I'll come [back] in three months.\n[doctor]  Yep, that's right.\n[patient]  I do have a question for you though.\n[doctor]  Yeah, of course.\n[patient]  Do you [think] I will be [able] to [drive] again?\n[doctor]  Oh [man], Mr. Watson, I knew you were going to ask me that one. I [think] at this point, it's unlikely that your movement [speed] will improve to the level that would be needed for you to pass the driver's [safety] evaluation. Now, I will say that I do occasionally of patients who surprise me by improving over a nine to 12-month range. And that definitely could be you. [You] could definitely pass it at that point. So if you improve and we can continue to [talk] about that, then you know, I [think] it could be [possible]. And I'd be [happy] to recommend it.\n[doctor]  Now, you could definitely also enroll in a driver [safety] program without my recommendation. So you could kind of do that preemptively, and then we could continue to watch for your improvement as we go.\n[patient]  Okay, I kind of figure that anyway, but I just thought I'd ask. I don't [like] to burden anyone when I just need to [run] to the store, but I also know that I need to be safe.\n[doctor]  Yeah, your [safety] is our number one [priority] and you know, I'm sure your daughters don't [mind] as much, right? They want to keep you here and have you safe. But I overall am very pleased with how much you have [improved]. And so, I'm sure when we [talk] again in three months, we'll continue to be on that upward trajectory or improvement.\n[patient]  I sure [hope] so, doc.\n[patient]  We really appreciate all that you've done. Do we make the appointment out front?\n[doctor]  Yeah, that would be great. The girls up front will take [care] of you and get you settled for three months from now. And you both take [care], alright?\n[patient]  Thanks.\n[patient]  Thank you.\n[doctor]  Alrighty. So, roast is constitutional significant for impertability to [carry] out daily functions.

Of note, he was [able] to get two of the three [memory] words with queuing and the third with multiple choice. This was a slight improvement over his initial [score] of 23 out of 30 with calculations and 24 out of 30 with spelling.

            "tgt": "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nFollow up adult hydrocephalus, 3 months status post shunt surgery.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nMr. Christopher Watson is an 86-year-old male who returns in follow up of adult hydrocephalus. This is his first visit since undergoing shunt surgery 08/01/2020. He is accompanied by his daughter, Theresa, together they give his history.\n\nI have followed Mr. Watson since May 2020. He presented with 8-10 years of progressive gait impairment, cognitive impairment, and decreased bladder control. We established a diagnosis of adult hydrocephalus with the spinal catheter protocol in June 2020 and he underwent shunt surgery on 08/01/2020. A Medtronic Strata programmable shunt in the ventriculoperitoneal configuration programmed at level 2.0 was placed.\n\nMr. Watson has had no hospitalizations or other illnesses since I last saw him. With respect to his walking, his daughter states that he is now able to walk to the dining room just fine but could not before his surgery. His balance has improved though he still has some walking impairment. With respect to his bladder control, initially there was some improvement, but he has leveled off and he wears a diaper. With respect to his cognition, both Theresa and the patient say that his thinking has improved. The other daughter, Hannah summarized it best according to the two of them, she said \u201cI feel like I can have a normal conversation with him again.\u201d Mr. Watson has had no headaches and no pain at the shunt site or in the abdomen.\n\nPAST HISTORY\n\nUrinary incontinence.\nAdult hydrocephalus.\nGait impairment.\nCognitive impairment.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\n\u2022 Constitutional Symptoms: Significant for impaired ability to carry out daily functions. Negative for fever or unintentional weight loss.\n\u2022 Genitourinary: Significant for urinary incontinence and wearing a diaper. Negative for genital sores, decreased or painful output.\n\u2022 Neurological: Significant for continued walking impairment and cognitive impairment. Negative for headaches, recent falls, or hallucinations.\n\u2022 Psychiatric: Negative for depression, excessive worrying, or mood swings.\n\nVITALS\n\nBlood pressure 124/80, heart rate is 64, respiratory rate is 18, weight 174 pounds, and pain is 0/10.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nConstitutional\nMr. Watson is a pleasant and cooperative man who is able to converse easily though his daughter adds some details.\n\nHead and Face\nThe shunt site was clean, dry, and intact and confirmed at a setting of 2.0.\n\nNeurological\nMental status: Tested for recent and remote memory, attention span, concentration, and fund of knowledge. He scored 26/30 on the MMSE when tested with spelling and 25/30 when tested with calculations. Of note, he was able to get two of the three memory words with cuing and the third one with multiple choice. This was a slight improvement over his initial score of 23/30 with calculations and 24/30 with spelling and at that time he was unable to remember any memory words with cuing and only one with multiple choice.\nGait: Tested using the Tinetti assessment tool. He was tested without an assistive device and received a gait score of 6-8/12 and a balance of score of 12/16 for a total score of 18-20/28. This has slightly improved from his initial score of 15-17/28.\nCranial Nerves: Pupils are equal. Extraocular movements are intact. Face symmetric. No dysarthria.\nMotor: Normal for bulk and strength.\nCoordination: Slow for finger-to-nose.\n\nRESULTS\n\nCT scan of the head from 10/15/2020: It shows a frontal horn span at the level of foramen of Munro of 4.6 cm with a 3rd ventricular contour that is flat with the span of 10 mm. By my reading, there is a tiny amount of blood in the right frontal region with just a tiny subdural collection. This was not noticed by the radiologist who stated no extra axial fluid collections. There is also substantial small vessel ischemic change.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\n\u2022 Adult hydrocephalus.\n\u2022 Gait impairment.\n\u2022 Urinary incontinence and urgency.\n\u2022 Cognitive impairment.\n\nMr. Watson has made some improvement with his hydrocephalus since shunt surgery. There is a tiny fluid collection in the right parietal region. I do not believe that this tiny amount of fluid is symptomatic, and it was not documented by the radiologist when he read the CT scan.\n\nMr. Watson asked me about whether he will be able to drive again. Unfortunately, I think it is unlikely that his speed of movement will improve to a level that he will be able to pass a driver's safety evaluation, however, occasionally patients surprise me by improving enough over 9 to 12 months that they are able to pass such a test. I would certainly be happy to recommend such a test if I believe he is likely to pass it and he is always welcome to enroll in a driver's safety program without my recommendation, however, I think it is exceeding unlikely that he has the capability of passing this rigorous test at this time. I also think it is quite likely he will not regain sufficient speed of motion to pass such a test.\n\nPLAN\n\nI had a long discussion with the patient and his daughter. We are all pleased that he has started to make some improvement with his hydrocephalus because of the fluid collection in the right parietal region, I would like to leave the setting at 2.0 for another three months before we consider changing the shunt.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nFollow up in 3 months.",

How much had you been [drinking]?\n[patient]  for five times a week hard [alcohol] so you know\n[doctor]  Okay, well it will certainly help your [blood pressure] if you're [able] to stop [drinking].\n[patient]  Yeah, yeah, I, I, I agree with you.\n[doctor]  Okay, are you taking your [blood pressure] [medications]?\n[patient]  Yeah, but I'm only taking half of the [light]'s centipril.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  I, well, the first time I took it, I felt the thargic and [tired]. So I only took a half dose the next time. I felt much better and I didn't have the [headaches] or the swooshing that started in my [left ear]. So I [feel] like it's definitely helping, but [I don't know]. I know. It's not going to be okay until I stop [drinking].\n[doctor]  And are you also taking the full dose of the [hydrochlorothiazide]? Do you have any [chest tightness] or [pressure] or any [shortness of breath]?\n[patient]  Yeah, I'm taking the full dose of that medicine too, and no [none] of those [symptoms].\n[doctor]  Okay, anything else I should be aware of or that we should be checking?\n[patient]  MM Nom\n[doctor]  Okay, good. Are you doing the [blood pressure] checks at home?\n[patient]  [Yes], [yes] I am.\n[doctor]  Okay good. What kind of numbers are you [seeing]?\n[patient]  [Well], in the morning I'm [seeing] lower numbers than in the evening, where I [run] anywhere from [like] 130 to 145 or 150 over 95 to 100 on the bottom.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  But in the evenings if I [sit] there for a while and then take it, it goes down. Kind of [like] when I come here it's always high, but then it goes down. In the mornings it's generally more normal where it's supposed to be.\n[doctor]  Oh\n[patient]  And, mm, also I'm taking my medicine in the morning when I get up instead of in the evening.\n[doctor]  Yeah, so it [sounds] like we are not too far out of where we want to be.\n[patient]  Right in the middle.\n[doctor]  Okay, well let me get a [listen] to your [heart]. Go ahead and hop up here.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Use my general exam [template]. All right, go ahead and take some deep breaths. Okay, good. Any [fever], [cough], [shortness of breath] or [sore throat]?\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  any recent travel or [contact] or [exposure] to the [coronavirus].\n[patient]  Nope.\n[doctor]  Have you received your [coronavirus vaccine]?\n[patient]  [Yes], on February 9th.\n[doctor]  Okay great. Alright well I'm just going to [look] at your [ankles] and [feet]. I'm looking for any signs of [swelling].\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Alright, well everything looks good. [You] can go ahead and [sit] up Miss Taylor. Alright, so the good news is everything is looking okay. I [think] we both agree if you were [able] to stop [drinking] your [blood pressure] would cease to be an issue for you.\n[patient]  Yeah, I agree with that.\n[doctor]  So, let us discuss the potential medicine to help you with that. What it does is it [blocks] some of the [brain] [receptors] that [alcohol] stimulates, and it tricks the [brain] into [thinking] it does not need [alcohol], thereby [cutting] down the urges.\n[patient]  the urge to drink or the constant [thinking] about it.\n[doctor]  It actually will help with both.\n[patient]  Okay, so is it like a one-time thing?\n[doctor]  Generally the shot is given about once a month, it can also be given as a daily [pill], but the shot does tend to work a bit better.\n[patient]  [You] have taken things like this in the past, and if it is a [pill], I know I won't take it. With a shot, it's not like you can untake it.\n[doctor]  Yeah, that's true. And the shot has been shown to work. It is more just a matter of getting you in to get your shot a month later with the nurse.\n[patient]  Yeah sure sure.\n[doctor]  Okay, so it's called [Naltrexone]. I [think] the other name might be [Vivitrol]. [Like] I've [said], the research on it is pretty good.\n[patient]  I [think] I may have taken an outtrex on before.\n[doctor]  Okay, yeah, maybe you have.\n[patient]  Yeah, if it was available in a [pill] form, then I'm almost certain I've tried it before.\n[doctor]  Okay, if this [sounds] good though, we can go ahead and get you started with the shot. I am looking and it looks like we have you coming [back] in on [May] 17 for your first shot. [Does] that [sound] good?\n[patient]  Yeah, yeah, that [sounds] great. Are there any [possible] [side effects]?\n[doctor]  Yeah, some people will [experience] some [nausea], [headache], [dizziness], onchy [anxiety], [tiredness] and trouble-[sleeping], but generally the [side effects] are mild and should go away within a few days.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Then we can schedule you for follow up in June to [see] how you're doing.\n[patient]  Alright, that [sounds] good.\n[doctor]  All right, great. [Well], otherwise stay with your current medicines, keep checking your [blood pressure], and let's [see] if we can stop the [alcohol] for good. Let us know if you have any questions, or any issues come up after you receive the first dose.\n[patient]  All right, [sound] good. Thank you.\n[doctor]  [You] are welcome. Have a good rest of your day.\n[patient]  [You] too.\n[doctor]  Miss Taylor is [drinking] [alcohol] for to five days per week to access.

Last time he was here, he received a [steroid] [injection] in his [right knee]. Hello Mr. [Nelson], how are you?\n[patient]  Um, about the same as last time. Money is still [swollen].\n[doctor]  That was your [right knee], correct? I take it the [injection] didn't help.\n[patient]  It did, maybe for a couple of weeks.\n[doctor]  That's it. And is it still [painful]?\n[patient]  Yeah, it's pretty [painful] and now the whole [leg]'s getting [swollen].\n[doctor]  Okay. What would you say your [pain level] is?\n[patient]  I mean right now it's about a three or so, but typically on a normal day it's around six.\n[doctor]  Okay, and it's been [swollen] like that for how long now.\n[patient]  since I was last here a couple weeks after that. So about, maybe two months now.\n[doctor]  Okay, but before it was just the [knee]?\n[patient]  Yeah, the whole thing wasn't [swollen] like this, but I tried to wear [compression] socks a [lot] of the time, but it hasn't been helping.\n[doctor]  Okay, okay, so that hasn't been working for you?\n[patient]  I mean it helped to some degree, but it's still [swollen], especially around the [knee].\n[doctor]  Hmm. Has it been keeping you from doing things during the day?\n[patient]  [Well], I slowed down a little bit and I found a few things too fast. But when it really hurts is when I've been [sitting] for a while and then I have to try and get up. I'm so stiff getting up I have to use a [cane] to get my bearings. I mean after a little bit it loosens up but that first getting up is real [difficult].\n[doctor]  Yeah, I can [see]. That makes [sense]. Have you been taking your [medication] regularly? [You]'re on Zelgins, right?\n[patient]  Yeah, the XR, I [think] it's 11 milligrams a day. Yeah, but I'm taking it every day and I'm also taking celebrates, which I started maybe two months ago.\n[doctor]  [Yes], the 200 [MGS] daily. How's that working for you?\n[patient]  [Pretty good], up until it started [swelling] again.\n[doctor]  Okay, well, come [sit] over here and if you could take of your socks and shoes and we'll take a [look] at your [knee]. And just to let you know, I have a service now that writes my note about the visit, so you'll [hear] me call things out and describe what I [see] fully.\n[patient]  Okay, gotcha.\n[doctor]  Right, so let's check your [leg]. Can you straighten it and does it hurt?\n[patient]  Yeah, why try to straighten it all the way it does.\n[doctor]  Okay, [range of motion] slightly diminished. I'm going to press here, okay? And how about here? Hmm, I [see] some pitting around the [knee] and [ankle]. [Normal] [capillary refill] in the [toes]. [Does] any of this area hurt?\n[patient]  Um, just kind of [saw] like an old [bruise].\n[doctor]  So I can [feel] that the [knee] is hot and that means there's something going on like some [inflammation]. So we can give you another [steroid] [injection] for that. I also want to get an [x-ray] of that [knee] so we can [see] where all the [swelling] is coming from.\n[patient]  Yeah, let's do it. [Sounds] go to me.\n[doctor]  Okay, and did we [set] up physical therapy for you last time you were here?\n[patient]  Yeah, that was some years ago, but that was the other [knee].\n[doctor]  Okay, so I [think] we'll [set] that up for you now. We'll also do an [X-ray] on that [knee]. I can send you for physical therapy and if [nothing] is helping, then we really might need to get a [surgery] consult to [see] what we can do with that [knee].\n[patient]  Okay, [sound] like a plan.\n[doctor]  Alright, so for today we'll go ahead and we'll give you the [steroid] shot. I'll try to [see] if I can get a little bit of fluid out before I do give you the [injection]. There might be no fluid, but I'll [see] if I can get anything out regardless.\n[patient]  Okay, and that's a procedure you're going to do right now.\n[doctor]  Yep. Once we're done talking here, and as far as the [edema] in your [legs], we'll take an [X-ray] to [look] for the cause, but there is a [lot] you can do as well. The [compression] socks are a good start. And also, do you eat a [lot] of [salt]?\n[patient]  I mean, I [love] my salty snacks.\n[doctor]  Okay. [Well], [salt] does have a tendency to make your [body] hold onto [water]. Reducing your [salt intake] could help with some of the [swelling]. [You] can also prop your [feet] up anytime you get a chance, especially at night. And have you talked to your private [care] doctor about this at all?\n[patient]  No, I figure I would just come here first.\n[doctor]  Okay, so I [think] try some of those things out first and if it doesn't help, definitely make an appointment with them. Also, as you know, Zelgens is a high-[risk medication], so we need to check your CMP levels every couple of months. So this time your levels are good, but do make sure to make an appointment for the [blood] work for next time.\n[patient]  Alright, I can do that. Thank you so much Doc.\n[doctor]  [Yes], of course. [Well], let me go ahead and get [supplies] and we'll get to work on your [knee].\n[doctor]  Fluid aspiration and [steroid] [injection] procedure. The risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained.

So that may be something else we should add in, a [lotion] to just help moisturize. But we'll [see].\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  And then again, when did you go down to just taking the doxocycline once a day?\n[patient]  That was last week. So the first two weeks, I did twice a day.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  And then I started [seeing] improvement and then I changed to just once a day.\n[doctor]  Okay, let me take a [look] at your [face] here. I'm going to describe for the transcriptionist what I'm [seeing]. Your Fitzpatrick [skin] type 4, meaning you're not going to [burn], you're going to sun tan, essentially for the V. And then on bilateral medial [cheeks], there are a few really [faint] [erythematous papules] and just maybe a little bit of [redness] around and underneath your [nostrils]. So you're right, it's not totally gone.\n[patient]  Yeah.\n[doctor]  I [think] I would go ahead and go [back] to twice a day every day with the docks of Cyclean.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Uh, but I would pick up the Eli [Delt] too.\n[patient]  Okay, I can do that.\n[doctor]  I mean, out of known risks associated with [medications], topicals are usually safer and preferable to oral [medications]. With that being [said], the doxocycline is low risk.\n[patient]  It is? Okay.\n[doctor]  And doxocycline can give you bad [upset stomach] or [heartburn]. It will make you [sunburn] even if you never [sunburn], so you have to protect yourself.\n[patient]  Yeah, I mean, I [feel] sunsensitive whenever I go out. So, I'm taking all the precautions with wearing a hat and all of that.\n[doctor]  Great! I just wanted to make sure you knew about that.\n[patient]  [Yes], I did. Thank you.\n[doctor]  All right, but I [think] to help get [rid] of it sooner rather than later, if insurance will cover the E-Lide L, pick it up and start using it.\n[patient]  Yeah, I did check. The insurance is not covering it.\n[doctor]  It's not? Okay. [Well], let's [look] around really quick, because if you use a Goudrex coupon, it will be around 30 to $40 or something.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Let's [see].\n[patient]  So with your coupon, it was around $850 or something.\n[doctor]  Oh yeah, that's way too much.\n[patient]  I agree. And because I also looked at the U-Kristo that you recommended in my notes, and if it's still ex, if it's still expensive, I could try that instead.\n[doctor]  Yeah, so it actually, it is actually more expensive. I [think] the price is fluctuate.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Because now it's showing the cheapest of $70 and when I looked before it was around $30 to $40.\n[patient]  Yeah, if it was around $200, I would have picked it up. But it was coming to around $850 after insurance.\n[doctor]  Okay, so I've found the [cream] form. We could try [ointment] form.\n[patient]  [You] mean the Taker Alimus?\n[doctor]  Yeah, I'm in.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  So if we send it to Pick and Save or Metro Market, let's [see] where else.\n[patient]  Can you do the metro market?\n[doctor]  Yeah, let me put in the prescription and we'll [see] what we can find.\n[patient]  Sure.\n[doctor]  Pharmacy is what I'm trying to say.\n[patient]  Okay, but it's not [steroid], right?\n[doctor]  [Correct], it's not a [steroid].\n[patient]  Okay, good.\n[doctor]  It's called a calcaneurin inhibitor. It's kind of like a [steroid] in that it [calms] [inflammation].\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  But it's not a [steroid], so don't use [steroids] on your [face] for sure, as they'll make this kind of [rash] [worse]. But also, [steroids] [carry] the risk of causing [thinning of the skin].\n[patient]  All right.\n[doctor]  These [medications] don't cause [thinning of the skin], and they're not going to cause some other kind of [rash]. The thing to know is that sometimes [5-10] minutes after you put it on, it can cause this weird kind of tingly or [needle]-[like] [sensation], or make it redder or [flush]. But it should only last a few seconds, and then go away. It's non-allurgy, or anything bad.\n[patient]  Okay, [got] it.\n[doctor]  So it only lasts a couple seconds. It doesn't mean it's going to happen again. It's [nothing] bad. It will still work, so keep using it as long as you know you can [stand] it, okay?\n[patient]  Okay, thank you for explaining.\n[doctor]  So I will say apply to [rash on face] twice daily until resolved.\n[patient]  Okay, so only apply to the [rash] area.\n[doctor]  [Yes], and keep using the [face] wash.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  I [think] you could just do it once a day. I don't [think] you need to do it twice a day, just because I don't want to [dry] your sky out too much, okay?\n[patient]  I never noticed that my [face] is [dry] or [got] thin. I [feel] so good after using it.\n[doctor]  I [understand], but it could get [dry] and I don't want to create other problems for you.\n[patient]  Alright, I'll just wash once a day with it, but it was [feeling] very good, like there's this little bit of moisture getting [back] in. With the other wash, when I would use it twice a day, I was [drying] out. But not with this one.\n[doctor]  I [see]. Okay. [Well] then do what [feels] good. If you do notice that you're starting to get [dry], then reduce to once per day.\n[patient]  That [sounds] good.\n[doctor]  So, to review, continue using the same [face] wash, continue with metro [cream], and increase the use of doxocycline to twice a day.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  and then just do it until it's gone and then do it for once a day for another week before [stopping].\n[patient]  Okay, [sounds] good.\n[doctor]  All right, and I'll rewrite your instructions here.\n[patient]  Thank you so much.\n[doctor]  If there are any other questions or you're getting different instructions, [feel] free to reach out to me and we'll clarify. Okay?\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  But in general, doxocycline is such a low risk. We're not going to have you on this forever. But especially since we're adding the tachyrilitis, I expect it will clear quickly.\n[patient]  [Sound] good.\n[doctor]  Alright, and I just want to really help knock it out as fast as [possible] since you've been dealing with it for so long now. I would take it twice a day until it's gone and then once a day for a week before you stop. I'll write it out like that. So twice a day until [rash] is gone and then once a day for another week before [stopping].\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Once the [rash] stops, you can stop the tachyriline misoicment. Continue doxocycline another week, and then stop. But you can keep using the wash and the metro [cream].\n[patient]  Okay, that [sounds] good. I can do that.\n[doctor]  And then hold off until I [see] you again before you start [back] any of your old products. If it's starting to flare again, if it's just a little bit, you can try just doing the tachyrolitis for a couple days to [see] if that's enough. If it's not, then restart the dy-docsocycline as well.\n[patient]  All right.\n[doctor]  I don't expect that to happen, but you know, if it does, you have the tools. Um, then you'll be [seeing] me for a follow-up. We can figure out what to do next. I would say if it's getting [worse] rather than better, just give me a call or send me a mycart message, okay?\n[patient]  [Yes], [sounds] good.\n[doctor]  Do you have enough refills?\n[patient]  Yeah, I [think] so.\n[doctor]  Okay, so it looks like you have another refill of the doxocycline, so you're good there. Metro [cream], you [probably] still have enough of that one.\n[patient]  [Yes], I do.\n[doctor]  All right, and I'll cancel the E-[Light] L-[cream] just so we don't complicate your list. [You] have plenty of the [face] wash still.\n[patient]  [Yes].\n[doctor]  Okay, and we'll get [rid] of the Clinton-Myson from your list as well.\n[patient]  And what would you suggest for a moisturizer?\n[doctor]  Yeah, so for that I would do something really basic like venecreme. Or even if it's just really [dry], you could use a little bit of [petroleum jelly]. Um, I'll give you a couple samples, okay? Let's make sure we have a follow up in about four weeks.\n[patient]  Okay, thank you.\n[doctor]  Okay, and I would stay away from any kind of anti-[aging] thing, any kind of plant thing. Really, let's just be sure we [talk] about any [new] products or reach out to me if you're going to try something else. Let's go get those samples.\n[patient]  Okay, that [sounds] good.\n[doctor]  for assessment and plan, parallel [dermatitis], [rosacea], including [ocular rosacea] and copy and pasteor patient instructions. I recommend that she gently wash her [eyelids] once a day with [gentle] [cleanser], such as vigny [cream]. Also use brooder [mask] as needed.",
            "tgt": "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nFollow-up for perioral dermatitis.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nJacqueline Miller is a 40-year-old female who is being seen today for a follow-up skin exam for perioral dermatitis. She also has a history of rosacea, including ocular rosacea. Today, she states that her perioral dermatitis is well-controlled, although it has not fully resolved. The patient was applying doxycycline twice a day with improvement, but her pharmacist advised her to reduce to once daily since it had started to improve; therefore, for approximately the past week, she has been using the doxycycline only once per day. She has not seen continued improvement but it has not worsened. She is using the sulfacetamide wash twice daily, denies drying of the skin, and reports that her skin is much improved moisturization. She also applies MetroCream immediately after using the sulfacetamide wash. She denies using other lotions and products, Cetaphil lotion or soap, or Neutrogena wipes. The patient did not begin Elidel because it is not covered by her insurance, and she was concerned about possible side effects from the medication.\n\nPAST HISTORY\n\nMedical\nPerioral dermatitis.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS\n\nDoxycycline cream. Apply twice daily.\nMetroCream. \nSulfacetamide wash. Apply topically twice daily.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nIntegumentary\nSkin inspection of the face was performed today.

She decreased her doxycycline per her pharmacist\u2019s recommendation, which possibly stagnated the resolution of symptoms.\n\nPLAN\n\nPerioral dermatitis.\nI counseled the patient about the risks and benefits of doxycycline and recommended she resume twice daily application until she reaches full resolution, and at that point she should reduce application to once a day for an additional week. The patient will not be using Elidel as I reviewed the cost of the medication and without insurance, it was too expensive. I provided a prescription for Tacrolimus and counseled her on possible side effects of using the medication. She will continue with Sulfacetamide face wash once a day. Also, use Bruder mask as needed.\n\nRosacea, including ocular rosacea.\nContinue using MetroCream twice daily. I recommended to gently wash her eyelids once daily with a gentle cleanser and try a gentle cream such as Vanicream.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nCall the clinic if symptoms worsen.

            "src": "[doctor]  Hey, good morning, Bobby. How are you?\n[patient]  I'm doing okay. I as you're aware, Dr. Miller sent me over for this [pain] in my belly that I've had for several weeks. They did. He did an [ultrasound] and then [said] I had [gallstones] and they recommended I stay several away from some high [fat] [food], but I'm just still having a [lot] of [pain] and he refer me to you.\n[doctor]  Alright, well, I'm sorry to [hear] that you're having [pain], but I am glad that he sent you over to [see] me. I want to [talk] a little bit more about that [pain], can you describe the kind of [pain] that you [feel]?\n[patient]  [Well], it's on the [right hand] side of my belly. It's right underneath my [ribs]. And it [feels] like a squeezing [severe pain] it comes and goes, but when it comes, it's really [severe]. And I get kind of [nauseated] and sick in my [stomach].\n[doctor]  Okay, and then when you get that [pain], can you rate that [pain] for me on a [scale] like zero being [none] 10 being the worst [pain] you've ever been in your life?\n[patient]  When it's [severe], it's [probably] innate.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right, and then time-[wise] are we looking at can it just come and go any time? Or is it specifically around meal times? How does that [pain] kind of [wax] and wane for you?\n[patient]  Most of the time, it comes right after I eat.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  but it also can come on a couple of hours after I eat also. So it's either immediately after I eat or a couple hours later, but it's [related] to [eating].\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  [You] know, I [like] to eat right.\n[doctor]  Doe-way also, speaking of [eating], let's [talk] a little bit about your diet. I [see] here on your [chart] that you're a type 2 [diabetic]. And it looked like that you were going to handle that with diet and exercise. Let's [talk] about that a little bit.\n[patient]  [Well], you know what my diet was [worse] when I before I was diagnosed with the [Type 2 diabetes].\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  And since then I've [cut back] on [sugar] and I started a little bit of a keto diet and I've lost about [25 pounds] over the last three months.\n[doctor]  Okay, so other than the [weight loss], how how is your diet is that has that been working out for you? I mean, do you does, does that, does that [fit] your lifestyle pretty well?\n[patient]  Yeah, it does it, I was surprised it wasn't as hard as I thought to go [back] and [cut] back and go more of a keto diet.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  But you know trying to [cut] out all those carbs my [symptoms] [got] better.\n[doctor]  Yeah\n[patient]  with the [diabetes] and my [blood sugars] are improving, but I still get that [pain] underneath the [ribs].\n[doctor]  Yeah, and that can happen. And one of those things that causes that is that those intake of that fatty foods, which is, you know, kind of the keystone or the hallmark of the keto diet, and have you noticed any improvement when you do [cut] out that fatty [food], and has that been [difficult] since you are watching your [carbon] take.\n[patient]  The fatty [food], it is a little bit [difficult], you know, I [like] those pork rinds and you know, I've had to kind of [cut] those out, they were a nice [staple] for me when I was on a keto diet, but I have [cut] out to those pork rinds because those are just so delicious and you know, I would say the little bit better, but I still get that [pain].\n[doctor]  Okay, and then do you have any [family history] of [gallbladder disease]?\n[patient]  Yeah, but you know, you know, I knew those coming both my dad and my mother both had [gallbladder disease] and had to have their gallbladders off.\n[doctor]  Okay, so both both your parents, your mom and your dad had your had their gallbladders taken out.\n[patient]  Yeah.\n[doctor]  Okay, and then I want to [talk] a little bit about your [activity level] and your and if your exercising has this affected your [ability] to get out and exercise.\n[patient]  Not really. I mean, I usually [got] to watch around meals, you know, but I've never been a big exercise right after [eating] anyhow. But you know, I'm so glad springs here because it gives me that opportunity to get [back] out. And you know, I [love] photography. I [love] nature photography and with the width of the woods, going from you know that dark barren [look] to coming alive with that green and then [budding]. I [love] to get out and take [foot] photographs there.\n[doctor]  That's awesome to [hear] you, I'm my wife, and I [like] to go over and take nature hikes through the [new] park behind the [rec] center. That just opened up, have you ever been over there to do any any picture taken we've [got] a bunch of beautiful nature pictures that we took about a week ago?\n[patient]  No, I haven't been there. I might have to try that out yet.\n[doctor]  Jetzt awesome!\n[patient]  I [like] to get down near the [river] that's where I [like] to [catch] especially around springtime.\n[doctor]  That's great, you next time you come in maybe you can bring in some of your pictures that would be awesome to [see].\n[patient]  Okay cool.\n[doctor]  So I'm just curious talking about your [symptoms] here. Have you had any [fevers] you mentioned something about [nausea]? But have you actually [vomited] from those [symptoms]?\n[patient]  There's times when the [pain] is really bad for a couple of days I've had some what I would describe as low [grade] [fevers]. And [yes], you're right, I have [feel] [nauseated], but I haven't thrown up.\n[doctor]  Okay, so if it's okay with you, I'm going to go ahead and do a quick physical exam. Your [vital signs] [look] good today. [Blood pressure] was 128 over 88 [respiratory rate], was 16 your [pulse rate] was 68. [You] were 8 feb. [Today], which is a good thing and your [oxygen saturation] on room [air] was 99% taking a [listen] to your [heart]. Here your [heart] is regular of rate and [rhythm] no. I don't [hear] any. Ack topic beats no clicks. Rubbs or [murmurs] noted [listening] to your [lungs]. Here they are clear and equal bilaterally to osculation. Now I'm going to go ahead and do an [abdominal] exam. I do note [positive] vowel [sounds] soft, non-[distended abdomen]. However, you are [positive] for some slight guarding there to the right upper quadrant, but I don't note any [rebound tenderness]. Now I'm going to press slightly here beneath your [ribs] on the [right hand] side. Now take a breath and does that hurt when I press.\n[doctor]  So I [see] that you're guarded there. So I'm going to say that that it did hurt when I did hurt when I.\n[patient]  Absolutely that hurts so much when you push right there.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  Sorry, I was just trying to capture my breath.\n[doctor]  Okay, that's no [problem]. So you are [positive] for Murphy's signs, but I don't appreciate any [peritoneal] signs. So let's [talk] a little bit about your results that I reviewed before you [came] in today. So your [abdominal] [ultrasound] shows multiple [gallstones] [present] in the [gallbladder], and I do appreciate some mild [thickening]. Now the [common bile duct] size is within [normal limits] at four. One millimeters now. Let's [talk] a little bit about my assessment and plan for you. Okay. I do believe you have some mild colisostitis. With [gallstones], I don't appreciate any frank [obstruction], but it looks like your [gallbladder] is inflamed. And it looks like that's happened maybe over the last few weeks since you've been having those [symptoms] now, since you haven't had any improvement with dietary modifications, I am going to make the recommendation that we do remove your [gallbladder]. And I would [like] to perform a laparoscopic colisostectomy. Now what that means is I'll make a few small incisions and insert a scope with some of those instruments that's going to remove that [gallbladder]. Through one of those little bitty incisions now, the [surgery] is going to take about an hour to an hour and a half. And you'll [probably] spend the night in the hospital because we just want to [monitor] your post procedure to make sure everything is okay, you're still going to want to avoid those high [fat] foods after [surgery] and eat foods that are going to be high in [fiber]. Now do you have any questions about what our assessment and plan is for for this?\n[patient]  No no questions today.\n[doctor]  Okay, now the other thing.\n[patient]  How soon can I how soon will I be [able] to get up and get [moving] [back] outside after the [surgery]?\n[doctor]  So the good news is since it's a laparoscopic procedure, you're going to be [back] on your [feet] pretty quick now for the first 24 hours. I'm going to want you to take it pretty [easy]. But after a couple of days, if you [feel] like [moving] around on some solid ground, you know, we don't want you [hiking] or anything like that. But if you [feel] like [moving] around on some solid ground, you can get up and walk around within a day or two and then in about a week. Or so I'll [see] you again and then we'll release you to go get [back] out there in nature.\n[patient]  Okay, thank you very much.\n[doctor]  [You]'re very welcome. The other thing I want to [talk] briefly about is now you're not your type two [diabetes]. I want you to follow up with your physician just to make sure that you're handling your [diabetes], especially the fact that you're going to have [surgery] and those type of things. And we will just continue to [monitor] your [diabetes] as has been outlined by your your additional either your endocrinologist or your [primary] [care] provider I'm going to have the nurse come in and get some paperwork signed. And if you don't have any questions for me, I will [see] you next week. And we will get this [gallbladder] out.\n[patient]  [Well], thank you very much. I'm looking forward to it. I don't want any more of that [pain] so.\n[doctor]  Alright that [sounds] good, we'll [see] you next week then.\n[patient]  Okay, take [care].\n[doctor]  Yeah",

This appears to have happened maybe over the last few weeks or since he has been symptomatic.\n- Patient Education and Counseling: I had a thorough discussion with the patient concerning surgical treatment. The preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative courses of care were described and discussed. I explained the surgery will take approximately 1 to 1.5 hours, and he will probably spend the night in the hospital for post-procedure monitoring. We also discussed that he should avoid high fat foods after surgery and eat foods that are high in fiber. All questions were answered.\n- Medical Treatment: Since he has not had any improvement with dietary modifications, I recommend a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. A mutually agreed upon surgical date has been scheduled for 1 week.\n\n2.

And so [like] I [got] [back] into the game, I was okay. But ever since then, the past couple of days, it's just been, it's been really bothering me.\n[doctor]  Okay alright, and so when exactly did this happen?\n[patient]  Yeah I'd say maybe it was [probably] about last weekends, so I'd say about [like] four days ago.\n[doctor]  Okay, well I'm [happy] at [age] 67 you're out there [playing] tackle football so good good for you and was it your [right shoulder] or your [left shoulder] that you injured?\n[patient]  It was my right.\n[doctor]  Okay, and are you right or left-handed?\n[patient]  I'm right-handed.\n[doctor]  Okay, and have you had any numbing or [tingling] in your [fingers] at all?\n[patient]  No [fingers] have been okay.\n[doctor]  Okay, and any problems with the strength of the [arm] at all, are you [able] to grab a cup of coffee?\n[patient]  Yeah, I [hands] doing okay, I can grab. I'm just trying to avoid lifting anything, anything, anything, anything a little bit too heavy like I had a chipmint command. So I had a box in the driveway the other day and reaching down and picking up the box was a little tough.\n[doctor]  Okay, and we're exactly on your [shoulder] does it hurt?\n[patient]  It's [cut] on the on the backside, right right around here.\n[doctor]  Thumbnaoth, okay, all right.

It's just the [shoulder].\n[doctor]  Okay, and any other orthopedic [injuries] in the past have you ever injured that [shoulder] before as far as you know?\n[patient]  Nope, nope, that one that one's been fine.\n[doctor]  Okay, and any other surgeries or any other medical problems.\n[patient]  I mean I had [appendicitis], so I had an appendectomy.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  [Maybe] [like] three, four years ago, but that's about it.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right, well, I'm just gonna go ahead and do a quick physical exam. I'm gonna be calling out my exam findings. I'll let you know what that means. So, and last thing, have you had any [fever] or [chills] since this happened at all?\n[patient]  A slight [headache], but no no no [fever].\n[doctor]  Okay, did you hit your [head] when you when this happened?\n[patient]  A little bit.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right, did you pass out?\n[patient]  Nope, nope stayed [conscious] throughout.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right, well looking at your [vital signs] here in the office, you don't have any [fever] your [blood pressure] looks quite good. It's about 122 over 76. Your [heart rate] is appropriate at 82 beats per minute and your [oxygenation] is 95% on room [air] on your [cervical spine] exam. There is no [tenderness] to palpation of the [cervical spine]. There is full [range of motion] on [head] exam. There does not appear to be any [trauma]. There is no echinemosis or [bruising] [right shoulder] exam on your musculoskeletal exam. There is [pain] to palpation of the posterior [shoulder] at the [acromioclavicular joint]. There is [decreased] [abduction] and adduction to about 90 degrees only there is there is a he is [pain] with [supination] and [pronation] of the [right arm] and there is a palpable radial [radial artery] [pulse]. Okay, so what does that mean that just means that you have some you know evidence of the [injury] there and we're going to [talk] about that. So I had the nurse do a [shoulder] [x-ray] on you before I [came] in the room and the results of your [right shoulder] [x-ray] show that you have an acute [acromioclavicular joint] [fracture]. So you just have a a small [fracture] of the [acromion]. I don't [think] that it's going to be anything that we need to do [surgery] for so let's just [talk] a little bit about my assessment and plan. So for your [right shoulder injury] for your acute [acromioclavicular joint] [fracture], I want to go ahead and just put you in a [sling] for now. I want to go ahead and prescribe [meloxicam] 15 milligrams. Once a day, I want to go ahead and just order a [cat] scan of your [right shoulder] just to kind of get a better [look] of how the [joint] looks and we're going to go ahead and refer you to physical therapy to strengthen your [shoulder] in [hopes] of avoiding [surgery] in the future. How does that [sound]?\n[patient]  Yeah, that [sounds] great. Just being [able] to take a little bit of something for the [pain] would would be really appreciated.\n[doctor]  Okay do you [think] you need something stronger than [Meloxicam]?\n[patient]  No give that shot.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  and [see] how that goes.\n[doctor]  Okay, any questions?\n[patient]  What can I get [back] out on the field?\n[doctor]  While you can't [play] tagle football for a while you have to have this [fracture] healed.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  And I would avoid doing it, you know, as we get older, you know our [bones] get a little bit weaker. So I would avoid the tackle football, maybe flag football in the future, okay?\n[patient]  Yeah, yeah, that [sounds] good.\n[doctor]  Okay, anything else?\n[patient]  Now I [think] that's been great. Thank you so much.\n[doctor]  Okay you're welcome, have a good day bye.\n[patient]  Thanks.",

Are you having [pain] when you're just [sitting] there or when you're [moving] around for a very [short period] of time it felt like I was going to tap over? I [like] I couldn't support my upper [body weight] and then my right [toe] or the [toes] on my [right foot] tingled a little bit, but that went away after about an hour. Okay, are you still getting that numbing and [tingling] periodically in your [feet] or is that completely gone?\n[patient]  That's completely gone and it just happened when I first felt the tweak in my [lower back]. I felt that [sensation], but I haven't since.\n[doctor]  Okay, and how about any [difficulty] or [weakness] in your [legs]?\n[patient]  Only if I'm carrying something heavy otherwise it seems relatively normal, but I [feel] the [sensation] so I'm a little [nervous] about carrying something heavy.\n[doctor]  Okay, and are, and do you still have [pain] down there in your [lower back] if I [turn] a certain way? Or if I roll over in my [sleep], I'll [wake] up from it from a [like] a [sharp pain]. But then that goes away if I position myself the right way, okay. And what have you been taking for the [pain]?\n[patient]  I took some [Tylenol], I took some [ibuprofen], I've tried [heat], I've tried [ice] and [nothing] really seems to help.\n[doctor]  Okay, is the [ibuprofen] any better than the [Tylenol]?\n[patient]  a little bit, but for sure a shorter [period] of time.\n[doctor]  Okay and did you get any [stomach upset] from the [ibuprofen]?\n[patient]  Now I try not to take too much, so I don't have an [upset stomach] from it.\n[doctor]  Okay, and did you go to [like] an urgent [care] centang or an [emergency] room have you had any imaging on this at all?\n[patient]  I went in urgent [care] and they wanted me to do a Mariah, but I was a little concerned because I [think] we maxed out our insurance. So I didn't do it because it started to [feel] better, but because it's been going on so long I'm a little bit concerned now. I do want to actually [move] forward with that.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right, and any other [symptoms], any problems with [like] your [bladder] or your [bowels], any [incontinence], or you know you [feel] like you can't go to the bathroom.\n[patient]  Now I haven't had any of those issues.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right. And any other, any other [past medical history]? Do you that you have any?\n[patient]  I had [knee] [surgery] about two years ago on my [right knee].\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  That went fine. I rehabbed a point has been fine that it [feels] about 95% ever since.\n[doctor]  Okay, and what did you have done to your [right knee]?\n[patient]  It was a total [knee] replacement.\n[doctor]  Okay, a total near replacement in 2018, is that what you [said].\n[patient]  No was actually about two years ago, so it's the spring of 2020.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right, all right, well, I want to go ahead and just [move] on to a physical exam. I'm going to be calling out some of my exam findings.\n[patient]  MM\n[doctor]  Now you have you had any [fever] or [chills] with this.\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right, all right. So looking at your [vital signs] here in the office, you know, they [look] really good to you. [You] don't have any [temperature] your [blood pressure] is good. It's about 117 over 56.\n[patient]  MM\n[doctor]  Your [heart rate] is nice and slow at 68 and your [oxygenation] is fine at 95% on room [air] so that means everything looks good.\n[patient]  Good.\n[doctor]  On your [neck] exam, I do appreciate some bony protuberance of the C5C6 do you have any [pain] when I [touch] here?\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  No okay on your lumber [spine] exam. I do appreciate you have [pain] when I [touch] here.\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  Okay, so there is no [pain] to palpation of the [lumbar spine], there is [decreased] [flexion], and extension of the [lower back] the patient does have a [positive] [straight leg raise], and there is some [spasm] of the paraspinal [muscles] of the [lumbar spine] on musculoskeletal exam, the [lower extremities] strength is equal bilaterally. So what does that mean Jeremy? That means that you have some, you know, maybe a some [arthritis] in your [neck] here, and or maybe. Just a little bit of some [injury] from from that from that. [Back] that [back] thing that you told me about.\n[patient]  MM\n[doctor]  Okay, but I [think] overall things [look] really good. So you know I had them do in Lumber [Spine] [X-ray] on you before I [saw] you. And I looked at the results of your Lumber [Spine] [X-ray], which showed no acute bony abnormality. [You] know, there was no [fracture] of your [back], or anything which is not surprising based on your [history]. So let's just [talk] a little bit about my assessment and plan. So I do believe it [sounds] like you have an acute [disc]. [Herniation] now, this did happen a few months ago, but it [sounds] like that's what you had based on the fact that you're still having [symptoms].\n[patient]  MM\n[doctor]  I do want to go ahead and order a Lumber [Spine] MRI to get a better [look] at what's going on you know [x-rays] really just [look] at the [bones] they don't show us any of the [soft tissue]. So let's go ahead and order the Lumber [Spine] MRI. I want to continue with physical therapy. So I'm going to refer you to a physical therapist through our health system.\n[patient]  MM\n[doctor]  And then I also want to go ahead and prescribe [Meloxicam] 15 milligrams once a day.\n[patient]  MM\n[doctor]  to help with that, do you have any questions about that?\n[patient]  No questions.\n[doctor]  Now if you do have a [herniated disc], we can go ahead and [talk] about some other [treatment options], maybe like an [epidural] [steroid] [injection] to help take down some of that [inflammation].\n[patient]  MM\n[doctor]  It might make you [feel] better, but we'll deal with that when we get there okay.\n[patient]  Sure.\n[doctor]  Any questions?\n[patient]  Not at this point.\n[doctor]  Okay, great thank you.\n[patient]  Thank you.",

[Not too well].\n[patient]  about a couple of weeks.\n[doctor]  Couple of weeks tell me what's going on.\n[patient]  I [wake] up with [shortness of breath].\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  I go to when I'm sure to breath there, I get [back] home, and I'm again sure to breath, so I had a tough time dealing with this.\n[doctor]  Have you noticed any, are you [coughing] up anything and he's [swelling] in your [legs]? Or what's going on?\n[patient]  Yeah, but I've been [coughing] up. I've been [coughing up blood].\n[doctor]  Okay, how long has that been going on for?\n[patient]  [probably] three weeks or so.\n[doctor]  Okay, and are you [coughing] a [lot] of [blood]? Or just a little bit of [blood]?\n[patient]  I [shave] three to four cups a day.\n[doctor]  While that's a [lot] of [blood], okay are you [throwing] up any [blood] are you having [bleeding] in any place else or just when you [cough]?\n[patient]  Only when I [cough].\n[doctor]  Okay, have you noticed any [bruising] or [bleeding] from your [teeth] or anything like that or from your [gums] or anything like that?\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  Okay, any [leg swelling] or [calf swelling] or any anything like that any recent [travel history] you've been on a plane or [trip] recently?\n[patient]  I had some [knee problem], but there is no [swelling], but it hurts that's been going on for quite some time.\n[doctor]  Okay, so that's not near the [knee problem], okay? And have you had any, have you been to the hospital or been to the [emergency] room? Or anything like that for your [coughing] and [coughing up blood]?\n[patient]  Now I try to get an appointment in the office, but they were kind of booked up.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  They just know.\n[doctor]  Alright, and alright, no, but no [fever] with this. So since you're here, your [oxygen] level looks pretty good in the clinic, it's about 94% on [pulse], your [pulse] [oxygenation], so that's good or you short a breath. So when you walk or you or you [exert] yourself, your short a breath, you [said], right, okay, and have you. And how how is your [blood sugar] been doing since this has been going on? I know you're on metform and how's your [diabetes] been doing.\n[patient]  Not so good, you know, kind of going up and down, I wear this dexcom.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  [You] know after meal they spike up while over 200.\n[doctor]  Okay, and...\n[patient]  And morning when I get up there around 150.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right. So it's been [running] a little bit high. I know we checked your [hemoglobin a1c] last time and it was about seven. Seven. I [think] and we had talked about, you know, improving your diet and improving some exercise, but is this [blood sugar] been high and low or high in normal when you're especially in the last three weeks or has it been going on for longer than that?\n[patient]  I would say about a month.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right. And how is your [blood pressure] been at home since you've been taking since these episodes that you've been sick or you're taking norvask?\n[patient]  [Yes], I am, but I keep them on some days because my [blood pressure] has been [running] someone on the low side.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right. And right now it's about 120 over 70, what how low does it go in the more when you check it?\n[patient]  while there are sometimes in the lower 90s.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right. [Well], let me let me examine you here in a second. And we'll [think] about you know what we need to do, especially with your [coughing] and your [shortness of breath]. Okay. So, Neeta, I'm [examining] you now. Let's pretend I did my exam. I'm just going to verbalize some of my findings so I can put it into my [chart]. Okay. And I'll explain what those things mean. So on my exam, you've [got] no [JVD]. There is no [swelling] in your [neck]. No [carotid]. Brutes your [lung] exam. [You]'ve [got] some [rails] and some ronkyon. On more on the right side, I don't [hear] any [wheezing] right now. There is some diminished [breath sounds] on the right side. As well on your [heart] exam, you've [got] two over-successolic [ejection murmur]. [You]'ve had that in the past that's [unchanged] from before the rest regular rate. And [rhythm] otherwise your belly exam is nice and soft on your [extremity] exam. [You]'ve [got] [one plus] [non-pitting edema] on both of your [lower extremities] on your on your [ankles]. No [calf] [tenderness]. No [negative] home in sign. So what does all this mean? So basically, you've [got], you know, you've [got] some [sort] of [infection] or something going on in your [lungs] that I can [hear] right now. The rest of your exam is pretty much stable. It's [unchanged] from before. So let's [talk] about what we should do about this. So for the first [problem] with the [shortness of breath], the first thing I want to do is go ahead and get a [chest] [x-ray] for you. Okay. [You]'ve been [coughing up blood]. I also want to send you to the [emergency] department to get some [blood] testing done. I'm [worried] about a [blood clot] or something else going on. So I want to get a [cat] scan of your [chest] as well. So I'm going to go ahead and refer you to the [emergency] department. I'll call them and and have you [head] over that way. They can get a [chest] [x-ray] and a [cat] scan and some [blood] work as well. And then we'll evaluate why you're having the [shortness of breath] and why you're [coughing up this blood]. Okay. And then depending on what they find you, may need you know, it could be as simple as a [pneumonia] or it could be something a little bit more serious. We may have to get, you know, start, you know, depending on what you find, we will get the right treatment started any questions about that or can you [drive] to the [emergency] department from here or is that okay?\n[patient]  Yeah, I can bike no [problem]. I have no question.\n[doctor]  All right, for the second [problem] for the [diabetes]. Since your [blood sugar] is [running] a little bit high, once you get over this and [blood sugars], [running] a little bit high once we get you over this hump of the [shortness of breath] and get this diagnosed, I'm going to go ahead and order another [hemoglobin], A1c today. We will [probably] increase your dose of [metformin] from 500 twice a day to 750 twice a day. So why don't we do that? And then why don't we have, we'll have the [hemoglobin] A1c [back]. And then we can once you get over this [illness] that your undergoing will, we'll discuss that moral have you come [back] in about three weeks to just discuss your [diabetes]. And what our treatment plan will be for that okay.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  For the [high blood pressure], definitely hold off on the norbask for right now. Let's figure out what's going, what's causing this episode of [shortness of breath]. I want some [blood] testing done. And once we have that under better control, we can reassess your [blood pressure]. So right now, hold the norbask, and then we'll have you come [back] once everything is done, okay?\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  Any other questions or anything we know if we need to [talk] about today?\n[patient]  No, I'm good.\n[doctor]  [Sounds] good we'll get you signed out here in a second.",

It's about 4 or 5 with some of the [swelling] going down.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right. And did you take anything at all to [relieve the pain]?\n[patient]  Anti-inflammatories.\n[doctor]  Okay, already, and did that help.\n[patient]  Yeah, the [ibuprofen] helped a little bit, but I'm on it pretty on a pretty regular basis right now.\n[doctor]  Gotcha, okay. Now tell me are you [able] to [bend] or straighten your [leg] ever since then?\n[patient]  I can [bend] it, but it hurts toward the end of the [motion] and I can straighten it, but it doesn't [feel] like I have to help get it straightened.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right. And then how about you [able] to bear any [weight] on it or walk on it at all?\n[patient]  I can still bear [weight] on it, but it [feels] just really loose and it doesn't [feel] normal.\n[doctor]  Gotcha, okay. Alright, well let's go ahead and take a [look] at your [knee] here real quick before I take a [look] at your [knee] here. I'm going to do a physical exam. And in terms of your gate here, I did notice that you do have a marked [limp] on your looks like it's your [right leg] upon ambulation. So let me go ahead and take a [look] at that [right knee] real quick. I do appreciate some significant [effusion in the right knee] just a slight bit of echinosis. Just [feel] around here, Scott, how does that [feel] does? That hurt when I kind of press on that there.\n[patient]  A little bit of [pain] there, not really bad, it [feels] like it's just more on the inside of my [knee].\n[doctor]  Yep, okay, so you definitely [feeling] some a little bit of [pain] to palpation at the medial [joint] line. Now I'm going to have you lie on your [back] and also I'm going to do some maneuvering here of your [leg]. I'm going to do a real quick [test] on you here, okay? All right, how does that [feel]?\n[patient]  Just [feels] just [feels] loose it hurts when you [pull] it at the very end.\n[doctor]  Okay, sorry about that. Alright, so you're definitely having some [difficulty] with some [passive range of motion] here, and you're lacking a few degrees of terminal extension to about 115 degrees, as well as lacking about maybe 20 to 30 degrees of terminal [flexion] on the [secondary] [secondary] to the [pain] here, and you do have a [positive] lockman exam. So one more thing I want to take a [look] at real quick, I'm going to take a [look] at your [toes] here real quick, very good, so neurovascularly. Your bilateral [lower extremities] are intact, and it looks like you have a [muscle strength] of a five out of five. So, Scott, you know, based on my examination here, your right [knee injury] is really suggestive of anterior [cruciate] ligamentaire, and you've heard of it [probably] even heard as ACL [tear] sometimes, especially when a [lot] of people do sports, and they injure their [knee] that that can happen, so my plan for you though, is I want I want to go ahead and order an MRI, because I want to evaluate the integrity of that ACL now. [You] may need [surgery], but we'll first take a [look] at that MRI result and reevaluate and reevaluate that first, but in the meantime, I want to go ahead and order some anti-inflammatory [medication], the locks of [cam] 50 milligrams a day, it's going to help reduce that [swelling] and the [pain], and then I want you to go ahead and [ice] the [knee] if you need to, if you're still [seeing] some [swelling] and some [pain] you can go ahead and use [ice] as well, but I definitely would [like] for you to moderate your [activities], so I would [like] for you to wear a [knee immobilizer], and then also use [crutches] when you walk around just to help you a little bit, so not to put too much [stress] and [strain] on that [knee] does that [sound] like a plan.\n[patient]  It does now. While I need to limit my work [activities], I typically [sit] behind a desk, but it's not been [very comfortable] [sitting] here lately.\n[doctor]  Yeah, definitely. So [yes], so you can limit the [activities] for sure. In terms of your work [activities], I know if you [sit] too long sometimes it can be [painful] because you do need to [move] that [leg] a little bit so it doesn't lock up. So I would [like] for you to do some slight [activities] not enough to [stress] your [legs], but definitely [move] them a little bit every now and then so it doesn't lock up on you okay.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Alright, I do want you to, I know you are, I know you actually jog often. So, I want you to just slow that down for a bit, no jogging for a while, until we get you no results of your MRI, until we figure out what we, what we are going to be doing okay.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Alright, and how's your dog you hasn't been jogging with you before the [incident]?\n[patient]  How just how's my dog or how's my job?\n[doctor]  [You]'re your dog.\n[patient]  Mein, mein, mein, mein, doches O Guy.\n[doctor]  Good.\n[patient]  is doing really well and he enjoys still [playing] around outside but looks like won't be [able] to do that for a little bit.\n[doctor]  [Very] good. Alright, well, I'm going to go ahead and have the nurse take you to the scheduler to get your MRI and I'll get [back] with you as soon as we get the results of that.\n[patient]  Okay, [sound] good, thank you.\n[doctor]  Thank you.",

I've been making a ceramic bowl and I'm going to paint it And I have to do some real full decorations, but I've really been working on it a [lot] and my gosh, This is hurting and I can't work on it right now because it's hurting so much\n[doctor]  I am so sorry. So I mean that's really cool that you do party. It's something that I've wanted to pick up you know, but [I don't know] that I have those skills yet. [Does] the [pain radiate] down your [arm] or up your [shoulder] or anything?\n[patient]  It does down my [arm] and along that inside of my [arm].\n[doctor]  Okay, so the medial aspect, okay. Have you did you hit it on anything?\n[patient]  No, not that I [recall].\n[doctor]  Okay, and have you ever injured your [elbow] before?\n[patient]  No, I haven't.\n[doctor]  Okay, alright, so on on a [scale] of 1 to 10 with 10 being your [arm] is actively being sought off by a chainsaw how bad is the [pain].\n[patient]  [Well], I'd say it's about a seven.\n[doctor]  Wow, that's pretty bad. [Does] it keep you up at night?\n[patient]  [Yes], it really does it to know if I roll over and it just [wakes] me up.\n[doctor]  Okay, have you done anything to [relieve the pain]?\n[patient]  while I've been taking some [ibuprofen], but that isn't really helping.\n[doctor]  Okay, and have you tried anything like [ice] or [heat] or anything else?\n[patient]  I tried a little bit of [ice] at first.\n[doctor]  Hmm.\n[patient]  But, and it's just been hurting for about four days now.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  Didn't get better.\n[doctor]  Okay, okay, so it's [probably], it do you [think] it's getting [worse]?\n[patient]  [Well], it's just not getting better.\n[doctor]  Okay, no, I [understand]. Okay. So I know that you also have [like] a [history] of [hypertension] and that we have you on 10 milligrams of lysinoprol have you been checking your [blood pressures] regularly.\n[patient]  Yeah, you know what I [remember] too. I mean, they've been pretty good 1 teens to 1 [30s].\n[doctor]  Okay, all right. And okay, do you [think] that you've been good about taking your [medications]? Do you usually take them every day?\n[patient]  Yeah, pretty much I.I. I you know [said] an [alarm] for that like centiprol.\n[doctor]  Awesome, that's great alright. And so I [see] that you also we are treating you for [diabetes] as well and that we have you on 500 milligrams of [metformin] twice a day. How about that? Have you been taking that regularly?\n[patient]  [Well], sometimes I [forget] I mean having a [medication] twice a day. [You] know sometimes I'm out doing stuff and I just [forget] to take it.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  and plus I kind of have a [sweet] [tooth]. So you know sometimes they're a little bit higher, you know [like] 150 to 170 so.\n[doctor]  Okay, alright, so when you say a [sweet] [tooth], what are we talking about there?\n[patient]  I [love] to [buck] also besides my ceramics. I'm really big and baking and I [like] to make cakes and then take them to you know parties and get together so you know family get together and I [like] to make center rules too I've been doing that since I was very young. So I kinda noticed that.\n[doctor]  Okay, [cinnamon] rolls can be kind of hard [like], do you for your cakes? Do you use fondant you know to [like], do any of the decorations?\n[patient]  No, I'm either just pretty basic, they're not overly fancy.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  Sipin' Rolls [got] that recipe out of a Southern [Living] magazine.\n[doctor]  Ouf zu\n[patient]  A long time ago and...\n[doctor]  So you know it's good.\n[patient]  Yeah.\n[doctor]  Alright, well, so I totally [understand] like baking and like the [excitement] of being [able] to give those to your family. But we maybe want to start [cutting] down on [eating] and [taste] testing ourselves. Is do you [think] that's something we could manage?\n[patient]  Yeah, I know I need to get better on it. I [probably] could use maybe a refresher on just managing what I should and shouldn't eat how [like] if I need to combine a [protein]. [You] know if I do eat something a little bit [sweet], maybe [playing] a [protein] or something with it.\n[doctor]  BOOM! Yeah, that [sounds] like... hey.\n[patient]  had some friends tell me something about that.\n[doctor]  Yeah, that [sounds] like a great idea. And I [think] if that's something that we can maybe discuss to get you in [contact] with someone who can offer you someone with a degree that can offer you some really good [advice]. [You] know, I don't want to as much as it's really helpful to have friends. I do want to be [able] to give you like a [source] of truth, right?\n[patient]  Yeah, I had a [diabetic] consult a long time ago, but it would be nice to [see] a dietician again and go over those. And maybe there's some [new] stuff too.\n[doctor]  100% yeah, you know, [like] I one of the things that I struggle with is like our eggs good for you or bad for you [You] know [like] with [cholesterol]. I [feel] like it changes every other year or something like that So you're right there [Maybe] some pieces of information that we do need to update and and you know over a fresh of course wouldn't hurt But if you don't [mind] I'm gonna go ahead and start my physical exam I'm gonna call out my findings and just go let me know if you have any Questions or if anything [sounds] anything that you want me to expand on further But this is just for the recording sake so we can get everything documented okay\n[patient]  Yeah, and can I ask you what word were my [vital signs]? Can you show me what my [vital signs] were?\n[doctor]  Yeah, that's a really good question. So our big and favorite one is going to be your [blood pressure], right? So you're right, [like] we are [seeing] some definite improvement today. It was 120 over 70 and honestly, that's a great place to be. So that tells me that your [medication] is working and that maybe we can start to evaluate a bit more your [respiratory rate] is completely normal. So I [see] it here as 18. That's wonderful, you are not [running] a [fever] so 97. 9. [You]'re honestly, that's within [like] a good enough range for me, you're sadding pretty well your [oxygen saturation] is 100% again. So that means that you're not experiencing any kind of [difficulty] getting in that [oxygen] to the rest of your [body]. I do want to say that you know [pain] is one of the vitals that we [worry] about. And you're saying that at its worst you're the [pain] in your [elbow] is a 7 out of 10. So that's something that I'm going to evaluate and then your [pulse rate] seems to be appropriate as well. So those are all great. Do you have any questions about that so far?\n[patient]  Now that [sounds] good, yeah, I was just curious.\n[doctor]  Yeah\n[patient]  Check it in a while so.\n[doctor]  I do want to say that like looking at you're the [weight] we do [see] [like] maybe a five pound increase from the last time that you were here But that's completely normal right to be [able] like to fluctuate you know give or take five pounds So I'm not I'm not I'm not [like] seriously [worried] about it But if we do come [back] and notice an additional five pounds then we might have to start talking about [like] actually [You] know what let's do that right now what kind of exercise regimen are you on?\n[patient]  While I do go for some walks in the evening, I try to get one in on the morning too.\n[doctor]  Hmm.\n[patient]  So not a whole [lot] other than that because I'm busy with my pottery or baking, so, but I do try to get out and walk daily.\n[doctor]  Okay, that's awesome, so [like] how about about how long are your walks?\n[patient]  while I just walk around the neighborhood. There's, you know, the sidewalks. And there's kind of a little bit more of a nature type area that goes across the [bridge]. And so it's [probably], you know, maybe one to two miles a day.\n[doctor]  While that's intense, I was not expecting that number. That's awesome. Okay. All right. So maybe this five pounds is [muscle]. We're going to go for it. Okay. But thank you. But that's some really important information. But I'm going to start your physical exam now. Okay.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Alright, so I know that you [said] that you are experiencing [elbow pain]. Could you tell me is it your left or your [right elbow]?\n[patient]  It's my ride.\n[doctor]  Okay, alright, [right elbow]. When I [touch] it, does it hurt on the inside?\n[patient]  [Yes], it does.\n[doctor]  Okay, so moderate [tenderness] at the medial [epicondyle] when you [turn] like when you [turn] your [wrist] is if you're trying to open a door knob do you [experience] [pain].\n[patient]  [No, not really].\n[doctor]  Alright, so [turning] out no [pain], but when you [turn] your [wrist] inwards do you have any [pain]?\n[patient]  Yeah.\n[doctor]  Okay, so [pain] with resisted [pronation] of right form. When you rest your [arm] on a table with the [palm] side up, all right, I want you to raise your [hand] by [bending] the [wrist] to experiencing any [pain].\n[patient]  Yeah, that hurts.\n[doctor]  Alright alright so when you are when I'm pressing here and like flexing your [wrist] are you experiencing any [pain]?\n[patient]  [Yes].\n[doctor]  Alright, [pain] with [flexion]. And when [bending] the [wrist], alright, when I [listen] to you, you know I'm just going to check your [heart] and [lungs]. Everything [sounds] good. No [murmur], no rub, no gallop, your [lungs] are clear bilaterally to bilaterally to osculation. I'm not noticing any [rash] for your Eurolbo. I don't notice any [bruising], any [swelling]. We do want to note that [tenderness], but otherwise there is no [discoloration], no [lesion]. So that's good, you're pulses and are equal bilaterally. And I [think] I [think] we have an idea of what we're dealing with here. Okay, so I'm going to go ahead and give you my [impression] and plan for your first [problem], like your [primary] [problem] that you are here for is [right elbow] [pain]. It's consistent with [medial epicondylitis] and that it just means it's [pain] caused from overuse and [damage] to the [tendons] in your [arm]. What we are going to do is rest it. I'm going to order a [sling] for your [right arm] and you can wear this while you're [awake]. [Well], I want you to apply [ice] to your [elbow] for 20 minutes, three times a day. I'm going to ask you to take 600 milligrams of [ibuprofen] that's three [pills] every six hours with [food] and you can take that for one week. I know it's really important that you [said] that you have something that a gift that you want to make for your son, but we're going to hold off on pottery for the next couple of weeks just to give your [arm] a chance to [heal], you know, [like] it's awesome that you want to be [able] to do these things for your family. But sometimes you know your [body] is not where you're where your where your [heart] is like where your [heart] and your [head] are right and then so.\n[patient]  I'll just let him know that I maybe I'll take a picture of what I have so far.\n[doctor]  Absolutely, that's awesome. And so it'll be like a a movie like coming soon to a shelf near you That's great for your second [problem] right? We have this long standing [diabetes]. I want to increase your [metformin] to a thousand milligrams twice a day I know that you're saying you're having a hard time keeping up with that So I want you to do a good job of like checking and recording your [blood sugars] every day I do need you to follow up with me in a couple weeks. I also want to order something called in a one-se since you are having a hard time with [like] the [blood] like the [blood sugars] every day and a one-se will give me a more accurate picture of [like] a longer [period] of time And then we might need to evaluate like what are what other [options] that we have if your [sugars] if we [can't get] them a bit more under control I do want you to follow up with me in a couple of weeks about the about your [diabetes] and for your third [problem] of [hypertension] We're just going to continue you on your [lysinopril] at 10 milligrams that's it seems to be doing its job. I'm really I'm really glad about that And it's [probably] due to the [walking] that you're doing. I forgot to mention for your [diabetes] We are going to recommend AA referral to [diabetic] [counseling] that way you can get [like] a bit more information on like the steps that you can take to help you with that\n[patient]  I was going to ask you how about my [x-ray], the [x-ray] of my [elbow]. How did that [look]?\n[doctor]  Your [x-ray] honestly looks great in that I don't [see] any kind of [fracture] or bony abnormality. So that's what makes me [think] that this is like a [tendon] [related] thing, right? So in reviewing your [x-ray] like it, it does support the the assessment and plan that I have given you\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  D.U.\n[patient]  Just true.\n[doctor]  Yeah, absolutely I do [think] for your [primary] [problem], the [elbow], that we might want to get put you in some physical rehab if the [problem] is taking a little longer to [heal], but we'll discuss that at your next visit here, okay?\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  All right, no [problem], any other questions.\n[patient]  Nope.\n[doctor]  Alright, thank you for keeping me accountable.",

And I also heard you say, you know, if you [twist] suddenly, that makes it [worse], is that correct.\n[patient]  It makes it [worse], it makes it [worse] on [media].\n[doctor]  Now you know I was looking at your records and I know you have that [history] of [diabetes] and I haven't seen you a while for follow up for that how you've been [feeling].\n[patient]  I mean, been okay. I mean, I take my meds.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  And I try to still have [sugar], but you know what I mean? I, you know, I mean whenever I get the chance, I mean, I, you know, I exercise, but you know what I mean? That's about it.\n[doctor]  Okay, so you're on.\n[patient]  MM\n[doctor]  Yeah, I [think] I [think] you're all that met formin twice a day.\n[patient]  Yeah.\n[doctor]  Yeah, okay.\n[patient]  [Yes].\n[doctor]  Do you [test] your [blood sugar] at home in the mornings?\n[patient]  Yeah, I mean I try to.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  Most of the morning, but sometimes I mean I go [skiing], yeah.\n[doctor]  And how have those numbers been?\n[patient]  They bump towards me and bit towards the higher side. I mean, I must have been.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  [You] know but.\n[doctor]  [Well] if...\n[patient]  Yeah.\n[doctor]  Yeah, if I [remember], write your family, don't they own that that bakery down on the corner of Main Street. And didn't they own that?\n[patient]  Yeah, thank you.\n[doctor]  And how do you stay away from those I [got] to be honest? I [love], I [love] the cakes and donuts they make those are delicious.\n[patient]  Yeah, I try to.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  But I mean, you know, they, they, you know, I have to visit them. And you know, I end up, you know, I mean getting some stuff, but it's not that much.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  Let's try to contain it, you know.\n[doctor]  [Well], let me sew. We're going to have to watch that and I'll come [back] and we'll [talk] a little bit about the [diabetes]. But let's go ahead and do that. I don't want to do a quick physical exam on you. I'm going to [look] in your [eyes] here. And so let me quickly [look] in your [ears].\n[patient]  I [see].\n[doctor]  Okay, that looks good. And any, let me [listen] to your [lungs]. Okay, your [lungs] are clear. And your [heart], it's a regular rate. And [rhythm], that's all good as we go through that. Now I want you to [sit] up here. I'm gonna press down your [back] starting at the top. And any [pain] up top, no.\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  Okay, and then once I get down here and around that low [back], I want to press in the center first as that cause you a [lot] of [pain].\n[patient]  Yeah.\n[doctor]  Yeah, okay.\n[patient]  Yeah, that's the spot.\n[doctor]  Okay, and if I come over here to the right now.\n[patient]  Not that much you know.\n[doctor]  Okay, so and then on the [left hand] side if I push down here kind of into your butt.\n[patient]  Yeah.\n[doctor]  Yeah, okay.\n[patient]  Yeah.\n[doctor]  Lay [back] on the [stretcher] for me for a second. I'm going to go ahead and [lift] your [legs] for me or I'm going to go ahead and [lift] your [legs] for you. Just relax. I'm going to start here on the right side when I [lift] that [right leg] up. [Does] that cause you significant [pain] or any [pain] at all?\n[patient]  a little bit.\n[doctor]  Okay, let me come around, let me [lift] up the left side. If I [lift] that up, does that cause?\n[patient]  Yeah, you're [dead], that's...\n[doctor]  Yeah\n[patient]  [Still] get tender, yeah.\n[doctor]  I can [see] that [grits] on your [face], so okay, that's good. And you know as I [look] at your [lower extremities], there's no [pain] or [numbness] or [tingling] in your [feet], or anything like that.\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  Okay, okay, so let me [talk] a little bit about my [impression] and plan. So for that [low back pain], I believe you have a musculoskeletal [low back strain]. I'm going to order a low [back] [x-ray]. So we'll order that and get that done as an outpatient. I don't expect to [see] anything significant, but it's going to tell me how those [joint spaces] [look]. And if you know if we're dealing with any [disc] issue, but that will be the start of it. And I'm also going to order some physical therapy too for two reasons to help with a little bit with the [pain], but also strengthen some of the [muscles] there in the [back]. So those are the two things that we are going to do now. I want you to take take 400 milligrams of [ibuprofen]. [You] can take that occasionally with some [Tylenol]. When the [pain] gets more [severe] up to about three times a day, I'm going to also give you a prescription for some flexoril that's a [muscle relaxant]. And I want you to take one of those once a day every evening. But be careful if you're doing any strenuous or hazardous [activities], such as driving after you take those now for your [diabetes]. My [impression] is that your [diabetes] is as under control. I noticed that we don't have in had a one C for almost five months. So I'm also going to order an A1C so we can find out where we are with that continue with your diet and exercise. We know that's really important. And then continue with your [metformin]. I'm not going to make any changes today, but we'll go ahead and [look] at that once I get that results of that A1C to you. Have any questions for me.\n[patient]  yet can i still go to the bakery\n[doctor]  I would [yes], it's nice for you to go to the bakery, but you can't have any donuts. I'm no I you just really need to watch that intake of anything that you might get at the at the bakery. So just be careful with those [carbohydrates], those sweets that you're taking as we go through your day. It's occasional occasional one perfectly fine, but on a routine basis, we need to watch that.\n[patient]  Right, and how soon should I know check my [blood sugars]? I mean, what's good you know?\n[doctor]  Yeah, that's a great question. I'm really glad you asked that I would prefer that you're taking your [blood pressure]. Every morning, the first thing you get up when you get up in the morning, that's going to give me a good idea. And so if you can do that the first thing in the morning and keep a record of it, you know, I know your [glucometer] keeps a record of it, but if you can write them down. And once we get that, a one-[see] that's going to give me a little more [guidance]. On how to deal with your [blood], your [diabetes].\n[patient]  Why do you [think] what I need to [see], you know, a [pain] doctor or, you know,\n[doctor]  Not yet, let's get that that's a great question. I'm end up referring you to a [pain] doctor for that [low back pain], but I really would [like] to start with some of the diagnostics first. Let's get an [x-ray]. And if there is, you know any question of that [x-ray]. And the [pain] continues. I'm going to go ahead and maybe order a [cat] scan. And then at that point in time, we can refer you to a [pain] doctor if we're still having significant [pain].\n[patient]  [Sounds] good.\n[doctor]  Okay, thank you. I'm going to send my nursing to [see] you and we'll get you out the door.\n[patient]  Thank you.\n[doctor]  Take [care].\n[patient]  That one is a follow up mm.",

I the medical assistant told me that you injured your [knee].\n[patient]  Yeah, I heard it [stepping] off a [curb].\n[doctor]  How long ago did that happen?\n[patient]  about two and a half weeks ago.\n[doctor]  two and a half weeks ago and what what [knee] is bothering you.\n[patient]  The [right knee], the outside of my [right knee].\n[doctor]  the outside of your [right knee].\n[patient]  Yeah.\n[doctor]  Okay, and did you actually [fall] down when this happened or?\n[patient]  Now I just [sort] of [turn] over my [ankle].\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  to the outside and I thought my [ankle] was the thing that was in a hurt most but after the [ankle] [soreness] went away the only my [knee] hurt and it [sort] of clicks when I walk\n[doctor]  And no, okay. So now it clicks when you walk. Okay, does it hurt when you walk?\n[patient]  No unless I [stand] on one [foot] for an extended [period] of time, like leaning my [foot] up against the wall.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  Then I [feel] like it's locked, and then I [sort] of have to ease into [walking] again.\n[doctor]  Okay, and what have you taken for the paint?\n[patient]  Really [nothing].\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  I'd be profan, but I'm not a big [pill] taker, so I [sort] of [sucked] it up and...\n[doctor]  [Does] the [ibuprofen] work?\n[patient]  At night, you know, during the day, I'm more active. So it really doesn't impact it, because I just work through it. But at night, it does help me to [settle] down and [sleep] better.\n[doctor]  [Does] your [knee] hurt when you're just [resting] and [sitting] there?\n[patient]  No, once up it's fine when it's down on the floor with my [foot] flat. It's fine. It does hurt when I rest it on my [heel].\n[doctor]  Okay, and are you [able] to do things like [bending] or things like that?\n[patient]  A full [squat], that's when I [feel] the most clicking like. If I go all the way down to a full [squat] like a catcher that's when I [feel] the most clicking, but otherwise no, there's no [pain], it's just the clicking, and I'm fearful that that's an [injury] of some type.\n[doctor]  Okay, alright now you [said] [squats] or you are you active or you doing like burpees going to?\n[patient]  Now I ride the bike.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  I ride the bike, I ride the bike, which I'm not doing now [pellet] and inside for the winter. I do have a winter bike though.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right, well, I have a peloton who is your favorite instructor.\n[patient]  I actually don't have a favorite instructor, I have more favorite rides.\n[doctor]  Okay, what kind of rides do you [like]?\n[patient]  I [like] rock music and regain music rides, so whoever is doing those in a began or a medium content I'm cool with.\n[doctor]  I can't picture you as a Reggade person, so that's [interesting] to know okay. All right, and any numbing or [tingling] in your [foot] at all.\n[patient]  [Yes], but not from any [injury], I broke my [foot] my [second toe] on my [right foot], and I have [numbness] depending upon the shoe I wear.\n[doctor]  Okay, when did you break your [toe]?\n[patient]  I've broken it three times over the last ten years, so it's just something that's an annoyance, but it wasn't caused by this [injury].\n[doctor]  Okay, so you do have some numbing and [tingling], but it's not [new].\n[patient]  Right, correct.\n[doctor]  Alright, alright, well let's just go ahead and I'm going to go ahead and do a quick physical exam. I'm going to be calling out my exam findings. I'll let you know what that means. So on your musculoskeletal exam on your [right knee], I do appreciate some slight [edema]. [You] do have a slight [effusion]. [Does] it hurt when I press on the outside of your [knee]?\n[patient]  No, not physically.\n[doctor]  Okay, there is no [pain] to palpation of the right lateral [knee]. I'm going to be [bending] your [knee] in all [sorts] of positions. [Does] that hurt?\n[patient]  only when you [pull] it to the outside.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  From my my [foot], when you [pull] it to the outside that the only time it hurts.\n[doctor]  Okay, the patient has a [positive] aeroist [test]. There's full [range of motion]. There is a [negative] lockman sign. The patient does on [cardiovascular] exam. The patient does have a palpable door salis pedis and posterior to be allis [pulse]. Okay. [Well], let's just I want to [talk] a little bit about I had the nurse do an [x-ray] on you. And I looked at the results of your [knee] [x-ray]. And it doesn't show any acute [fracture] or bony abnormality, which is not surprising based on your [injury]. So let's just [talk] a little bit about you know my assessment and my plan for you. So I [think] you do have a lateral a lateral [collateral ligament] [strain] based on your exam findings. And this this [type of injury] essentially can be healed by itself. [You] know, I don't [think] we're going to need to refer you to [surgery] or anything like that. I want you to go ahead and I'm going to prescribe maloxicam 15 milligrams once a day. I do want to go ahead and refer you to physical therapy because if we strengthen up those [muscles] and areas around that [injury], then that will make your [knee] stronger. It help prevent future [injuries]. Are you [able] to [ice] it at all during the day? Now you [said] you're working you work in sales, so you [said] you're home.\n[patient]  Yeah, I actually am a home, so I can [ice] it and I have been icing it.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  I mean, 20 on 20 off at least four times a day.\n[doctor]  Okay, and so does that help at all.\n[patient]  It makes it [feel] better in the morning when I first go to my desk. And at the end of the day before bed, you know, I take [ibuprofen], so I don't have [swelling] overnight, but honestly, I have a pretty decent threshold for [pain]. So it's not good, it's not changing it by much.\n[doctor]  Okay, do you [feel] like your [symptoms] are getting [worse] or better? I [think] I [think] pretty much for the last two weeks they've remained about the same, that the only time I [feel] like they get [worse] is when I [exert] myself doing up and down like gardening in the yard or [moving] pots.\n[patient]  and stuff outside that the only time I felt like it [got] any [worse], but [nothing] to the point where it stayed [worse].\n[doctor]  Okay, all right, well, let's go ahead and refer you to physical therapy. If you're still having [pain], then we might have to consider an MRI.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Any questions about that?\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  Okay, alright well it was very nice [seeing] you today call me if you need anything.\n[patient]  I will.\n[doctor]  Okay, bye.\n[patient]  Bye.",
            "tgt": "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nGregory Price is a pleasant 68-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of a right knee injury. The onset of his pain began 2.5 weeks ago, when he stepped off of a curb and turned over his ankle. He locates his pain to the lateral aspect of his right knee. The patient also reports clicking with ambulation. He denies any pain with ambulation unless he stands on one foot for an extended period of time. The patient also reports locking of his knee with prolonged standing. He notices pain when he is resting his foot on his heel. He denies any pain at rest and elevated, or when his foot is flat on the ground. The patient states that he is more active during the day, which does not impact his knee pain. He adds that he is able to perform a full squat without pain. The patient reports numbness and tingling in his right foot, however this is not new. The patient has been taking ibuprofen, which provides him with relief at night. He has also been icing his knee 4 times per day, which provides him with relief in the morning and at the end of the day.\n\nMEDICAL HISTORY\n\nHe states that he has fractured his 2nd toe 3 times over the last 10 years.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nThe patient works in sales. He rides a bike for exercise.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nNeurological: Positive for numbness and tingling in his toes on his right foot from prior injury.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nCV: >Palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulse.\nMSK: Examination of the right knee: Slight edema. Slight effusion. No pain with palpation of the right lateral knee. Positive varus test. Full ROM. Negative Lachman's.\n\nRESULTS\n\n4 views of the right knee were taken. These reveal no evidence of any fractures, dislocations, or bony abnormality. No other abnormalities are noted.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nRight knee lateral collateral ligament strain.\n\nPLAN\n\nAfter reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. I have explained to him that his x-rays did not reveal any acute fractures or bony abnormality. I have recommended that we treat the patient conservatively with formal physical therapy to strengthen his right knee. I have also prescribed the patient meloxicam 15 mg to treat his pain. If his pain does not improve with physical therapy, I will recommend obtaining an MRI.\n",

I have ever seen you before here.\n[patient]  I'm training for triathlon and the [back] of my [heel] hurts typically after a workout or when I first get up in the morning it will really hurt in the [back] of my [heel] all the way up into my [calf].\n[doctor]  Okay now tell me a little bit about this triathlon training. What are you or you [running] far? Are you tell me kind of how you work out for that today?\n[patient]  I will [run] about 10 kilometers.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  In the morning at lunchtime, I try to get on the bike for about 45 minutes to an hour.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  And then in the evening I go to the Aquatic [Center] and I [jump] in the pool and swim for about another 30 minutes to an hour.\n[doctor]  While that's an aggressive campaign to get there, so really [hope] you get that triathlon, and so how many days a week does this occur that you're training?\n[patient]  I do that five days a week on the weekends. I kind of alternate between you know a long [run] and a long bike don't really do a long swim but...\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  I just [swimming] on those other five days and I take one day off.\n[doctor]  OK, on your [running] days or when you do the [running], tell me a little bit about your stretching routine. Do you or you aggressive [stretchers]? [You] do not stretch at all. I know people that do both.\n[patient]  Yeah, I don't stretch at all. I don't have time for that.\n[doctor]  Okay, and I'm assuming that with a bicycle either you don't really work the [lower legs] to get them stretched out you just [jump] on and go correct.\n[patient]  Yeah.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  Yeah, you know what, when I first start off, I go slow until I'm [warmed] up and then I.\n[doctor]  Okay, tell me a little bit about the [pain] as you [said] it it's after the activity, but you when you first [wake] up in the morning it [sits] there also.\n[patient]  When I first get out of bed, it just [feels] really tight and almost like it's [tearing]. I after I've been [walking] around for about 10 or 15 minutes, it eases up a little bit. But if I ever [sit] down for any extended [period] of time and then try to get [back] up, it's really [sore] again.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  or\n[doctor]  No go ahead go ahead.\n[patient]  After a [lot] of activity, it'll get [sore] too.\n[doctor]  Okay, okay. I'm sure this is impacting that [ability] to really focus on your training as you're going with that with that type of a [pain]. So let me go ahead and let's take a [look] at your your and your [lower extremities] here and yeah, okay, so roll up your pants. Yeah. Okay, good. Now does your [left leg] hurt at all? Do you get that [severe pain] or is it mainly on the right?\n[patient]  No, it's mainly just on the right.\n[doctor]  Okay, so I'm going to just hold your [leg] here and I want you to take your [foot] and [ankle] and I want you to go ahead and just [pull] your [toes] up towards you does that create some [pain] when you do that.\n[patient]  Yeah, a little bit.\n[doctor]  A little bit okay, now I'm just gonna hold your [foot] up and I want you to push against me. And does that hurt?\n[patient]  Yeah, that hurts a little bit too.\n[doctor]  Yeah, okay, okay, roll over here on my my [stretcher] for me and I want you to dangle your your [feet] over the edge And what I want to do is I just want I'm gonna [squeeze] your [left calf] first and when I do that does that hurt on your left side\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  and I'm going to [squeeze] on the right side anything there.\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  Okay, okay, well that's good to do your Thompson [test] is [negative] that's a really good [finding] and I just want to continue pressing here on your right from your [heel] when I [squeeze] your [heel] does that cause significant [pain] at all.\n[patient]  Yeah.\n[doctor]  Yeah, okay. And if I come up a little bit further as I [run] up that [Achilles tendon] does that hurt?\n[patient]  That's real tender.\n[doctor]  Yeah, okay, okay. Great, not great. So, yeah, go ahead and [sit] up for me. So, Dennis, my diagnosis is [Achilles tendonitis]. And it's really from overuse when we [see] this frequently. When somebody starts to you know, get in and train aggressively. For an event I'm unfortunately, I'm going to have to ask you to stop training for AA week or two I know that's concerning. But I really want this to [heal] before we [move] into that next phase. I didn't ask you about [medication], but I'm assuming whatever you were doing wasn't working significantly. So, what I'd [like] you to do is take some [ibuprofen] or advelle that's the same [medication]. And I want you to take three [tablets] every six hours. And that's really an anti-inflammatory. See, if we can eliminate some of that [tendonitis] type [pain] that you're getting that [inflammation] around that [Achilles tendon], I'm going to also order a couple physical therapy visits. And the reason for that is I'd [like] you to get some strength and stretching [understanding]. I [think] it's important for you, especially here at the beginning is to get some of that Rayal stretching knowledge in and [learn] how to stretch those [muscles] before you start these [activities]. And they're going to help strengthen your [lower extremities] also. And I want you to come [back] to me within you know a week to 10 days following your first couple physical therapy appointments. So I can [monitor] how you're doing. I [see] no reason for an [x-ray] at this point, but if this continues, we're going to you know if you're still having [pain] 10 days and significant [pain] without change modification of your activity. Then we may have to [look] at more aggressive treatment plans. How does that [sound] for you?\n[patient]  [Sounds] good.\n[doctor]  Okay, hey did you happen to [catch] that Pittsburgh ping one hockey game last night?\n[patient]  No, I was watching the track meet.\n[doctor]  My gosh, the the paying ones are on [fire], you know they beat up on New York 7-2. I mean the hockey is just an amazing sport. I just do guide you do a [lot] of hockey down there in town here.\n[patient]  [used] to when I lived in Detroit.\n[doctor]  Oh\n[patient]  Hockey town, but not so much anymore.\n[doctor]  No yet a troid is a hockey town yet the red [wings] okay well i'm gonna go ahead and i'll send my nurse in and go ahead and get you discharged and [like] i [said] i'd [like] to [see] you [back] here in seven to ten days after that first physical therapy appointment i've [got] a great phenomenal office [staff] you just call in once they get scheduled they will get you into that next available appointment so take [care] and i will [talk] to you later\n[patient]  Thanks.",

Denies left leg pain.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nMSK: Examination of the right heel: Pain with resisted extension. Mild pain with flexion. Positive calcaneal squeeze test. Severe tenderness to the Achilles tendon. Thompson test is negative, bilaterally.\n\nRESULTS\n\nNo new imaging was obtained today\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nRight Achilles tendinitis.\n\nPLAN\n\nAfter reviewing the patient's examination today, I had a lengthy discussion with the patient regarding his current symptoms. I have explained to him that his symptoms are likely secondary to overuse. I have recommended that we treat the patient conservatively. The patient was instructed to take at least 1 week off from his training to recover from this. I will provide him with a referral for formal physical therapy to strengthen his right lower extremities. I have advised him to take 3 tablets of ibuprofen every 6 hours for pain. If his pain does not improve with physical therapy, I will recommend obtaining an x-ray.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nThe patient will follow up with me in 7 to 10 days to check on his progress.",

            "src": "[doctor]  So hey Christina, good to [see] you today. I [see] you're here. [You] have a non-[healing] footser. [Well], also looks like in my notes that you [got] some you've [got] [type 2 diabetes] and that [probably] the reason for your [ear], but also not [healing]. So how are you doing today? What's going on?\n[patient]  Doing pretty good except I [can't get] this [ulcer] to [heal].\n[doctor]  Okay, how long has that [wound] been [present]?\n[patient]  [Maybe] about a year.\n[doctor]  A year well that that's a that's a a long time so when it started I guess did you have any [trauma] to the [foot] or did was it just all of a sudden\n[patient]  No [trauma], it just seemed like a little [blister] and then I picked at it and it did get a little bit red and [infected]. So I talked to my [primary] about it.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  I went on some [antibiotics], it seemed to get better, but [nothing] is really making it go away.\n[doctor]  Okay, when was the last time you were on [antibiotics]?\n[patient]  It's [probably] been five months.\n[doctor]  Five months, all right, do you [remember] which [antibiotics] you were on?\n[patient]  [Keflex]\n[doctor]  [Keflex], alright, so kind of does your [foot] hurt or is it just just the...\n[patient]  No [pain], but I don't have much [feeling] in my [foot].\n[doctor]  Alright, so you've [got] [neuropathy] yet, that that makes [sense] with the [diabetes]. So have you had any other [symptoms] like a [fever chills] any [drainage] coming from it?\n[patient]  Lately there has been a [lot] more [drainage] and I just [feel] a little more [tired].\n[doctor]  Okay alright well that [sounds] good so today is Thursday so what do you have for the weekend?\n[patient]  Not too much, I'll [probably] be [walking] around in the zoo on this [ulcer] all weekend and [eating] out and not doing anything my doctor wants me to do.\n[doctor]  No, yeah, yeah, I know you do have that [diabetes]. I know your [PCP] [probably] wouldn't be excited about you [eating] out and all that, but you know, hopefully we can we [eye] can at least get your [foot] a little bit better. So your [diabetes], I know we talked a little bit earlier. How is that going for you? Is it controlled? [You] know, what's your [blood sugar]'s [running]?\n[patient]  Yeah, they're [running] better than they were, but they're still in the 200, so my doctor doesn't [like] that my last A1C was about 10.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right, yeah, I you [probably] definitely need to get [back] with your [PCP] about that because the A1C is is pretty high and I know he [probably] had you on some [medication] and [insulin] and [metformin] and [insulin] just to try to get that lower but\n[patient]  [Yes].\n[doctor]  [You] know, we are here for your [foot]. So let's let me take a [look] at that. So we will do a quick exam of your [foot]. So you don't have any [fever]. Your vitals [look] good. So on your your [right foot] exam, I can [see] here you do have a one by two centimeter, two inch circular [wound] on the dorsal aspect of a lateral [right foot]. So it's just proximal to the fifth MDP [joint]. I do [see] some yellow slew that's [present] with minimal [granulation tissue]. [You] have no surrounding [erythema] or [cellulitis], and there isn't any evidence of fluid collection. I don't [see] [necrosis]. So there is no [dead] [tissue] around it. There's no [odor], and I don't appreciate any bony [exposure]. And does it hurt when I [touch] it here?\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  Okay, so we did an [x-ray] of your [right foot] before you [came] in, and it showed no evidence of [osteomyelitis] that means that there is no [bone infection], which is really good. So let me just [talk] a little about my assessment and plan of your [foot]. So you do have that [diabetic foot ulcer]. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to order a ABI or [ankle]-brakel index, and that's just to determine your [blood supply], just to [see] if we can. Actually, [heel] that [wound] I know it's been there for about a year, which is a pretty long time, and so we just need to [see] if we can if you do have that [blood flow]. Just in case we needed to make other goals for that [foot], just to [depend] upon that I'm also going to do a debridement here, have you had that done before of the...\n[patient]  [Yes], I [think] so.\n[doctor]  Okay, so you know, you know pretty much about that. So I'm just going to try to take off some of that [dead] [tissue] we'll do that here in the office afterwards. And then I'm going to prescribe you some [collagenase] [ointment]. And you could just add that to your [wound] once a day and cover it with a [sterile] [dressing]. And we're going to try to continue that until we [see] it start to shrink. And hopefully you know that will work between the debridement. And then the [ointment] did. They give you at your [PCP] they give you a [surgical shoe] or have you been wearing your regular shoes?\n[patient]  I've just been wearing my regular shoes.\n[doctor]  Okay, so we're going to get you a [surgical shoe] and I want you to wear that and that can help you take [pressure] off the area because I know you [said] you're going to walk around with a sews this weekend. So I definitely don't want you to put much [pressure] on it from now on and hopefully they can help it [heal]. And so after all that I'm just going to [see] you [back] in two weeks and we could take another [look] and [possible] do another debridement of the [ulcer]. So do you have any questions for me?\n[patient]  I don't [think] so.\n[doctor]  Alright so I'll [see] you [back] in two weeks and I [hope] you're fun at the zoo this weekend.\n[patient]  Thank you.\n[doctor]  Alright, thanks.",

The onset of her wound began 1 year ago with no specific injury. The patient states that it seemed like a blister and she picked at it where it then turned red. The patient was seen by her primary care physician and was prescribed Keflex. She states that the antibiotics improved her symptoms, however they did not resolve them. The patient adds that she was last on Keflex 5 months ago. She denies any pain, however she reports decreased sensation in her foot. The patient also reports increased drainage and fatigue. She states that she has been wearing her regular shoes.\n\nThe patient has type 2 diabetes with neuropathy. She states that her blood sugars are running better than they were; however, they are still in the 200's.

            "src": "[doctor]  All right, Julia. So you've been coming to [see] me for a while now ever since you had an RCA [STEM] place [back] in 2018, but I [see] you're here for follow up after an interior STEMI, where we had to put in another [STEM] right so [like] how are you doing?\n[patient]  While me was a real [shock] for me, I thought everything was fine after my last [heart attack]. And then I just started having this horrible [chest pain] and it wouldn't go away. So I went to the [emergency] room and yet they told me I needed another stint.\n[doctor]  Wow, so you were experiencing similar [symptoms] similar to what you had the first time.\n[patient]  Yeah, it was, yeah, it was bad, it was just like the last time.\n[doctor]  Okay, have you had any [chest pain] or [shortness of breath]?\n[patient]  Now I [think] I [saw] you about six months ago and I was doing fine.\n[doctor]  Okay, have you been [able] to [like] exercise at all since you last [saw] me?\n[patient]  [You] know I walk my dog every day and you know we go like a mile and a half or two miles.\n[doctor]  Awesome, okay. Yeah, you know because [like] [fall] is [setting] in [like] are you excited?\n[patient]  Yeah, I'm excited.\n[doctor]  Do you have any like plans for the holiday?\n[patient]  No, I'm a mum. No. I'm just, you know, looking forward to [seeing] family and having some nice [weather] and yeah.\n[doctor]  Okay, so I do want to ask I know that you have a [history] of [coronary artery disease] [hypertension] and [diabetes]. So I want to get an idea of where you [stand] with those have you been experiencing any kind of [leg swelling].\n[patient]  I have noticed that my [legs] are a little [swollen] since they sent me home from the hospital.\n[doctor]  Okay, are you [able] to lie flat at night when you [sleep]?\n[patient]  I always use a couple of pillows, you know, maybe I've had to [sit] up a little bit more, but I mean for the most part one, [think] it's pretty normal.\n[doctor]  Okay, and then have you been [able] to afford your [medications] and are you taking them like you're like you were prescribed?\n[patient]  Yeah, I'm [able] to afford to afford them. I have good insurance. I am taking them. They told me it's really important to take them so, so yeah.\n[doctor]  Yeah, that's very accurate. [You] know, [like] there are huge consequences to not taking them. So if you are noticing any problems, please, please, please, please, let us know how about your diet, are you watching your [salt intake]?\n[patient]  I mean, I'm not [eye]-[eye], I haven't really adjusted. I mean, I tried to watch it after the last [heart attack]. And now, you know, I've kind of been less strict with my diet, but I'll have to go [back] to watching the [salt intake].\n[doctor]  Hmm.\n[patient]  I [love] pizza, it's my favorite [food].\n[doctor]  Yeah\n[patient]  I try to [problem] my second favorite [food].\n[doctor]  What are you for her toppings on pizza?\n[patient]  Pepperoni occasionally vegetables.\n[doctor]  I'm not even more right, but you know that pepperoni is pretty high in [salt] on top of a cheesy pizza right.\n[patient]  I know I know I'm gonna work on it.\n[doctor]  Okay, so we are going to have to negotiate some of these diet things, and then especially since you have [diabetes], [like] have you been managing that well?\n[patient]  My I've been watching my [sugars] yet because I don't want to go on [insulin] so I'm taking that met form in that's why I've been [walking] my dog I'm trying to stay active\n[doctor]  Okay, okay, so you know maybe this is just a situation of [like] where we are on the right path, but [probably] need to step up a few things, okay?\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Alright, so I do want to do a quick physical exam, so you are aware I'm going to be calling out my findings as I [run] through it alright.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Alright, so your [vital signs] [look] good, you know? So I'm glad that it looks like you're tolerating your [medication] pretty well on your [neck] exam. I don't appreciate any jugular venous distension, so... And then on top of that, I'm not, I don't appreciate any [carotid] roots, so... I'm not [feeling] anything like too concerning on your [heart] exam, though. There is a three over six-histolic [ejection murmur] heard, at that I'm [hearing], at the left [base]. That's not like a huge deal, especially considering, [like], what? [You]'ve been through already in terms of the hospital, but it is something that I want to know in your [chart] when I [listen] to your [lungs], your [lungs] are clear over here with your [extremities]. I do notice, you know, some lower, lower [edema swelling], sorry, some lower [swelling], [edema] lower, [lymphedema]. And it is pitting [one plus] on your right [radial artery], the cath side is clean [dry], and intact without [hematoma], and I also your right [radial artery]. [Pulses] are palpable, so I did review the results of your EKG, and they show a [normal sinus rhythm] and a good, our [wave] [progression]. NAA evolutionary changes that are anticipated after STEMI, one of the reasons, though, that we had you come in, is that we noticed on your echo, there is a [reduced] [ejection fraction] of 35%, we are a little bit concerned about that, so let's [talk] about my assessment and plan for you your [primary]. And [like], first diagnosis is going to be [coronary artery disease], right? [You] already have a [history] of that, but you know, we're going to do some things to make. We're going to continue to evaluate that over time I want you to continue your [aspirin] 81 milligrams daily, and your [Berlin] to 90 milligrams twice daily. I want to continue you on a high dose [statin] called [lipitor], and you're going to be taking that 80 milligrams a day, and we're going to continue you on your toprol, and that's going to be 50 milligrams daily. I am going to refer you to [cardiac] rehab, so we can get you some [education] and give you some [confidence] to. Get [back] to [exercising regularly], I know it was kind of scary to have such an episode, but I promise like most of the patients I have [love] [cardiac] rehab, and I [think] you'll do pretty well for your second diagnosis. We have newly, you have newly [reduced] [left ventricular dysfunction], and moderate [mitral regurgitation]. What I [think] is [like] what that means is that you're [pumping] like the way that your [heart] is [pumping] is a bit. Concerning, but I [think] [like] given your [history] that it will improve over. Time they [got] you into the cath lab pretty quickly, so I [think] that the [muscle] is just kind of [like] stunned, like surprised. And since you're compliant with your meds, I [think] you will [recover]. We're going to continue you on your Lycinoprol 20 milligrams daily, however, considering that you are retaining fluid. I [think] that your third diagnosis is like we are crossing into [acute heart failure]. I'm going to prescribe something called a [diuretics] called [LASIX], and I do want to we need to take that 40 milligrams. Once a day, I want to add all Dactone 12, 5 milligrams daily, and I need you to get labs. Finally, we will repeat another echo in about two months last, but not least there is the [hypertension], your [blood pressure]. Seems fine. I [think] with the L Dactone that you'll tolerate that pretty well, but we do want to maybe get you into some [nutrition] [counseling] to consider, like what other diet [options] might be available to you, maybe suggestions of things that you haven't thought about like [cutting] out. [Meet] especially any kind of preserved meat like pepperoni, but maybe [finding] you some alternatives, how does that [sound]?\n[patient]  That [sounds] good, yeah. So I'm here as long as you tell me I'm gonna get better, I believe you.\n[doctor]  [Yes], yeah, I strongly believe this is our best course of action and that you'll get better given enough time. I [see] that you're making efforts. I'm really glad that you're out there [walking] and that you're cognizant of your diet and [willing] to make changes. We will just do you know [monitor] it over time, okay?\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  All right, thank you.",

            "src": "[doctor]  Hey Jose, how are you doing? It's been about you know three or four months since I last [saw] you what's going on.\n[patient]  I'm doing okay. I guess the [medications] are helping I'm concerned about all the [medications] I'm taking, but I [think] I'm doing okay.\n[doctor]  Yeah, yeah, you are on a fair amount of [medications]. [You] know, we do have you on those [medications] because you did have a [heart attack] about six months ago. They put that that [stand] into your [left anterior descending artery]. And so that's a [major artery] on the left side of your [heart]. And so we need to keep those [stents] open and then kind of help your [heart] [heal]. So it is going to be very important for you to continue on those [medications]. So you're still taking your [aspirin]. And are you still taking the brilinta?\n[patient]  [Yes], and [fish oil].\n[doctor]  And [fish oil]. Okay, good now how are you doing with the crere store? I know that that's you know that's the [statin], that's the [cholesterol] [medication] you were concerned that it might cause you to have some [muscle aches] or you're taking that.\n[patient]  I [think] I'm doing good, but I might [feel] like I, when I guess the only [complaint] that I have is ever since [I don't know] if this is a [heart attack], or if this is the [medication], but when I [stand] up real fast, I get really [dizzy].\n[doctor]  [You] get you get [dizzy], okay? Yeah, you know, we do have you on what we call a beta [block] or metaprolol. I [think] your dose is 50 milligrams once a day, and you know, sometimes it takes a little bit for your [body] to adjust to that. But [yes], if you [stand] up too quickly, it can cause you to be a little [dizzy], so...\n[patient]  Okay, okay, that makes [sense], okay. That's good to know, because I didn't know what the [problem] was so can I ask you a question regarding the stance?\n[doctor]  Yep.\n[patient]  How long do I have to have that in there?\n[doctor]  So the [stents] are permanent, we don't remove them so yet. So that's why it's going to be super important for you. [You] know you're going to be on [aspirin] for the rest of your life. And then I'm going to keep you on that Berlinta for another six months that's going to help prevent that [stent] from clogging.\n[patient]  Okay, okay, do I need to ever replace the stance then?\n[doctor]  No, I mean, every so often the [stents] can become narrowed again. But you know that's why you're [seeing] me or cardiologist, so that I can follow you for that now if you start to have [symptoms] again of any [chest pain] like you had before or any [shortness of breath]. When you start to [exert] yourself, I want you to tell me and we might have to go ahead and send you for further testing to make sure that those [stents] are okay. But typically if you continue to take the [medication], watch your diet that type of thing. Your [stents] will stay open for a long time.\n[patient]  Okay, all right, that [sounds] good, you know. I haven't had, hey, I had I know you asked me to follow up with a dietician because I had [diabetes] as well, which [probably] contributed to my [heart attack].\n[doctor]  Yeah\n[patient]  I'm any [new] order, [I don't know] who I forgot who I was supposed to [talk] to.\n[doctor]  Okay, that's okay. Yeah, I certainly can help you with that now. Managing your [diabetes] is also going to [play] an important role in your [coronary artery disease], which it [sounds] like you already know that which is really good. So I will put in another referral for [diabetic] [education] for you. How are you doing watching your sweets? I know that you know you do have an [affinity] for those [chocolate] chip cookies.\n[patient]  It's okay my one C wasn't where I wanted, but my [glucose] is coming in about 130.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  [Fasting].\n[doctor]  Okay, what was the what was the A1c, the [hemoglobin], A1c if you don't [mind] me asking?\n[patient]  I thought it was close to 60.\n[doctor]  Okay, yeah, that's really high, so we want it to be about 6, so you do have some work to do with your diet.\n[patient]  Yeah, so okay, so I know you asked me to do a [blood] [test], so I did that I was wondering if you [got] the results.\n[doctor]  I did you know I looked at the results of your [kidney function] that's what we call your [creatinine] just because you had some [contrast dye] and sometimes [contrast dye] can impact the [kidneys] and your [kidney function] is stable, which is great when was the last time you [saw] your nephrologist.\n[patient]  Oh\n[doctor]  That's your [kidney] doctor.\n[patient]  I'm a bad, I'm a bad patient, so [probably] a year ago.\n[doctor]  Okay, you know you do have the [Stage] 3 CKD. So that's the [Stage] 3 [kidney disease]. So it is going to be important for you to follow up with your nephrologist just to make sure that everything is okay. Now I did check your [kidney function] and it was fine, but are you staying away from things like [Motrin] and AdVal?\n[patient]  Right, yeah, that's I threw all of those out.\n[doctor]  Okay, good, okay, perfect. Now I know that you're from the [West] Coast, are you super excited that law won the Super [Bowl]? Or are you more of a [San] Francisco 49 or a [span]?\n[patient]  I'm a more of [San] Francisco fan.\n[doctor]  So, do you [like] Jimmy G? Do you [think] he can beat Aaron Rogers again?\n[patient]  Okay, we'll [see] what happens, but I'm pretty flexible when he comes to you know that is, but one thing that since I can't take [Motrin], what [pain] killer can I take for [headaches].\n[doctor]  [You] can take [Tylenol].\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Yeah\n[patient]  Alright, that [sounds] good.\n[doctor]  Yeah\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  This is I don't [think] I have any other question. The only thing I'm going to need is I need some refills on my [medications].\n[doctor]  Yeah, I can do that, but I do want to just do a physical exam on you, okay? So, and looking here at your [vital signs] here, you know your [vital signs] [look] quite good. [You] know your [blood pressure] is what right where it should be. It's about 127 over 80, which is great. So you're doing a good job taking your metaprolol now in terms of on your [neck] exam. I don't appreciate any jugular venous distension or [carotid] roots on your [heart] exam. I do appreciate a slight three out of six isolic [ejection murmur] heard at the left [base]. And on your [lower extremity] exam, I do appreciate some [one plus] [non-pitting edema] now. What does that mean? What does that mean? Jose. So all of that means is that I do [hear] a little [heart murmur] on your [heart], which I've heard before in the past. And it doesn't, it doesn't [look] like you're retaining any fluid, which is good, but you do have a little puffiness in your [legs], which sometimes some of the [medications] can cause.\n[patient]  Yeah, I do have that.\n[doctor]  So let's just go over a little bit about my assessment and plan for you going forward. So for your first [problem] of your [coronary artery disease], I [think] you're doing really well, I want to go ahead and refer you for [cardiac] rehab just so that you can be more active and have some [confidence] in exercising again. Okay, and I am going to go ahead and refill your metaprolol your [Crestor] 40 milligrams once a day as well.

            "src": "[doctor]  [Yes], so sorry so Barbara is a 31 year old [female] and she has [history] of [diabetes type 2] and [asthma] and she is here today with [abdominal pain]. So Barbara tell me a little more about your [abdominal pain] what's been going on.\n[patient]  So I've been having this [pain] for the past one week. And as you know, I have a long standing [history] of [diabetes]. And I guess I've been [drinking] too much coffee lately. [I don't know] if that [trigger] my [gastritis] so.\n[doctor]  Yeah\n[patient]  I [think] it's been but lately.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right. And so is it increasing in severity would you say or staying about the same or what?\n[patient]  It's gradually increasing for sure.\n[doctor]  Okay, alright, and along with the [pain] have you had any [nausea] or [vomiting] or [diarrhea]?\n[patient]  Naja and [vomiting] is on and off.\n[doctor]  Hmm.\n[patient]  So I would say I've experienced [nausea] for about [like] three times in the past week.\n[doctor]  Okay, okay, and so, and you [vomited] how many times?\n[patient]  A couple of times.\n[doctor]  Okay, I've been [drinking] a [lot] of coffee you [said] too. Uh, is that is that Starbucks? I [love] those nitro-caliberous and Starbucks. We ever had those. Those are incredible.\n[patient]  Yeah.\n[doctor]  That's...\n[patient]  [Endo] de 20.\n[doctor]  Yeah, the for sure you [got] to go veneon that you really have to coax them into it, though they won't even give you. It's like you need a license to get a veneon that that nitro is so strong, so that's my [Achilles] [heel] I tell you. But okay, so you [think] that might have you [think] maybe coffee contributed to your [abdominal pain], a yee you've been [drinking] more coffee, and maybe that's [related] as you're [thinking].\n[patient]  Yeah, I [think] so because I started last week and toward the end of last week my [coffee intake] was pretty bad. So I've been [controlling] myself this week and you know I [probably] just had one cup.\n[doctor]  Okay, yeah, okay. And so is the [pain] in your [upper abdomen] or where in your [abdomen] is it?\n[patient]  It's on both the sides of my [upper abdomen].\n[doctor]  I'm okay.\n[patient]  So I'd also increases when I work out [like] if I want a jog or [like] go for [run] my [abdominal pain], just like spikes, you know, so I have to take it [easy].\n[doctor]  Okay, alright understood. [You]'ve not had any [fever] with that [pain] have you.\n[patient]  No, I haven't.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right, and so how about your [diabetes]? How's your [diabetes] been doing? How your [blood sugar] has been? What low 100s to 200s? Where where is it?\n[patient]  I [think] it's been under control, it's 800 so.\n[doctor]  Okay, good. And you're still taking them at 4,500 milligrams. Once a day, right now, actually, it looks like [last visit] we increased that to 500 milligrams twice per day. Is that correct?\n[patient]  [Yes], that's [probably] helping me keeping it under control so.\n[doctor]  Okay, good good. And then for your [asthma], have you had any recent [asthma attacks]? And are you still taking the [flow] vent twice a day and are all butyl as needed for [wheezing]?\n[patient]  [Yes], but sometimes I [forget], you know, I haven't had any [asthma attacks] lately, so I just figured I could decrease.\n[doctor]  Yep, okay.\n[patient]  I [think] that's a good [decision] though.\n[doctor]  Yeah, well, better to stay on the [flow] vent daily, and then just use the [albuterol] if you need it, but if you stay on the [flow] vent daily, it will decrease the frequency of those [attacks]. So, yeah, all right, well, let's go ahead and examine you okay. So on your physical exam, it's pretty normal for the most part, unremarkable. But I all say on your on your [heart] exam, you do still have a [grade] three out of six [systolic ejection murmur] that's [unchanged] from your prior exam. And I'm not [worried] about that. We're kind of watching that, but it just means I [hear] some [heart sounds] when your [valves] are [moving]. And otherwise [normal heart] exam for your domino exam, you do have mild [tenderness] in the [epigastrium] of your [abdomen], your abdomens. Otherwise, soft, there's no [tenderness] in the right lower quadrant whatsoever. And there is no significant [tenderness] in the right upper quadrant. So I [think] you know that's right where your [stomach] is in the [upper abdomen]. So I [think] that you know that maybe you may be right, this could be some [gastritis]. So then otherwise on your exam on your [lung] exam, you do have some mild end expiratory weasers very [faint] and otherwise normal [lung] exam with excellent [air] movement and otherwise pretty normal physical exam. So let's [talk] about your my assessment and your plan here. So first of all for the first [problem] of the [abdominal pain], I do [think] that you have [acute gastritis]. And I [think] this is [probably] [related] to the [caffeine] intake. And I know that you've had AA, moderately heavy [history of alcohol use] too. So I wanted to [cut back] on the [alcohol] as well. [You] know, keep that down to a dull roller like maybe keep that less than two or three drinks a week would be great. And then also [cut back] on the [caffeine]. And that should help. And I'm going to write you a prescription for Xantac as well as we need. And so I'll write you a prescription you can take that twice a day that should help with the [acid] in your [stomach] and the [pain]. And then I'm going to check A your analysis, a [urine] [pregnancy] [test], a CBC, a comprehensive metabolic panel as well. And we'll [see] what those results show just to be sure it's [nothing] else going on. And then for your second [problem] of [diabetes type] two, let's continue you on the [metformin]. But I want to adjust the dose slightly. I'm going to increase the morning dose to 1000 milligrams. And the evening dose we can keep at 500. So we'll go met 4,000 milligrams in the morning and 500 milligrams in the evening. Please continue to check your [blood sugars]. Let me know what they are when you come [back]. [You] know, we just keep track of those. And then we'll [see] you [back] in four weeks. By the way, I want to have you follow up with me in four weeks. And for your third [problem] of [asthma], let's continue you on the [flow] vent that seems to be doing pretty well continue to take that daily. And then also [Albuterol] is needed. So how does that [sound] for a plan? Any other questions, comments, suggestions.\n[patient]  That [sounds] good, and I also [feel] like I'm [eating], been [eating] a [lot] of spicy [food].\n[doctor]  Hmm.\n[patient]  Lately that could be contributing towards my [gas] strides. So I'm going to [cut back] on that as well.\n[doctor]  Okay, yeah, I'd also recommend while this is hurting you definitely [cut back] on the spices, the spicy [food] easier [said] than done sometimes I know, but yet the up or right [sounds] good. [Well] [listen], I'll [see] you [back] in four weeks, give me a holler if you have any questions or anything else in the meantime.\n[patient]  I will.\n[doctor]  Alright you take [care] sure you [got].",

I [understand] you're having some issues with your [hand].\n[patient]  [Yes], I [sit] at the keyboard all day long and recently I've been having some [numbness] and [tingling] in my [right hand].\n[doctor]  Okay, how long has that been going on?\n[patient]  [I don't know] [probably] on and off for six months, but over the last month or so it's been a little more persistent.\n[doctor]  Okay, okay. And when does that [numbness] and [tingling] do you get a [lot] of [pain] with it first? Let me [ask that question].\n[patient]  Some [pain].\n[doctor]  Some [pain].\n[patient]  Mostly what I'm actually typing on the keyboard is when I [experience] the [pain].\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  But the [numbness] and [tingling] is all the time now.\n[doctor]  Okay, and when you get this [pain], what makes it better is it's [stopping] and just [resting] for a while, or do you take [medications] or try other?\n[patient]  I've been taking [ibuprofen], so [ibuprofen] and seem like not typing on the keyboard helps the most.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  The other thing that makes it hurt is my mouse.\n[doctor]  Your [mouth] okay.\n[patient]  Wow\n[doctor]  Yeah, when you're [moving] that around okay.\n[patient]  Yeah.\n[doctor]  [Does] this [pain] ever [wake] you up in the middle of the night? Or the [pain] or the [tingling]?\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  No, okay.\n[patient]  not affecting my [sleep].\n[doctor]  Okay, so and you're using [Motrin] for for [ibuprofen] for the [pain]. [Well], let me go ahead and take a take a [look] here at your Is it Both [Hands] or just your [right hand]?\n[patient]  Mostly my [right hand].\n[doctor]  Mostly your [right hand], okay? So let's go ahead and take a [look] at that [right hand] when I [bend] your [wrist] does that cause any [pain]?\n[patient]  [Yes].\n[doctor]  It does okay and so you do have some [pain] on extension and if you [pull] your [hand wrist] up towards you does that cause the [pain] also.\n[patient]  [Yes].\n[doctor]  Yeah, okay, so you do have [pain] on [flexion] and extension and when I [touch] the fingertips here now you [said] you had some [numbness] in your [thumb] and your [index finger] and a little bit in your [middle finger] the other two [fingers] they [feel] okay or do you [think] that there is different than the other [hand].\n[patient]  Yet for some reason it really is just that they [thumb] the pointer in the [middle finger] that I [experience] the most [symptoms] with.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  Not why that is.\n[doctor]  Okay, so I want you to [grip] my [hands] here and just [squeeze] tight, okay? So you do have a little bit of a less [grip strength] on the right, and that's typical that we would [see] with this type of [pain]. And an [numbness] that you have going on now, I want you to [turn] your [arm] over for me, and I'm going to [touch] on or tap on the inside of your [wrist] or or form. And when I do that, I can [see] your [face] or [grimacing] so that that must cause that shooting. [Pain], yeah, okay. So you do have a [positive] tunnel sign. So in Alexis, what I [think] is going on is that you have a [carpal tunnel syndrome], and we [see] that frequent.\n[patient]  I was [afraid] of.\n[doctor]  Yeah, you [see] this frequently, but people who are doing [data] entry spend a [lot] of time on keyboards, or you know, some a [lot] of manufacturing people who do a repetitive procedure again. And again, we'll get that type of [pain]. So here is my plan I'd [like] to put you in a [splint], and it's it's kind of a [wrist splint]. I would [like] you to wear that at night that will help with that I want you to continue with the ibuprofins, but I would [like] you to go up to 600 milligrams four times a day and...\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  We're going to do that now I am going to order some AA outpatient [test] called an EMG, where we [look] at that [nerve conduction] study in that [wrist]. And that's really what's happening here is you've [got] some [thickening] into the in the [wrist], and the the [membranes] of the [wrist] that are just pressing down, and just compressing some of those [nerves], any other questions for me for now if that [test] comes [back] [positive], and we'll [talk] about that later on here. Next, visit if it comes [back] [positive], we may. Have to do, we're going to stick with conservative treatment first, but we may consider some [surgery], where I can go in and release that impingement on your [nerves] through your [wrist]. It's a simple outpatient procedure, and then I [think] you would [feel] better. How does that [sound]?\n[patient]  That [sounds] like a good plan. I was [hoping] maybe I could get some [relief] with some therapy rather than having to go to [surgery]. So I [like] that plan very much.\n[doctor]  [You] will start with the the [wrist splint], and once I get the [nerve conduction] studies that will give me another idea whether or not I need to send you some physical therapy in addition, or if we need to go directly to [surgery], but that will all [hinge] on that [nerve conduction] [test]. Do you so? Do you have any further questions?\n[patient]  No, that's great. Thank you so much.\n[doctor]  Thank you very much.",

Also, you have a [past medical history] of [hypertension] [diabetes]. We are going to check up on those as well. So can you tell me what happened to your [elbow]?\n[patient]  Sure, I heard it about a week ago, [playing lacrosse] with my kids, just suddenly started hurting me when I was [throwing] the ball.\n[doctor]  Okay, okay, so how old are your kids?\n[patient]  My oldest is 13 and the other one is 10. I was [playing] with a 13 year old.\n[doctor]  Okay, yeah, I know I [play] with my kids sometimes and I [think] I'm getting too old to do all that. So I just I've hurt myself before as well. Alright, so with your [elbow], what part of your [elbow] would you say hurts?\n[patient]  It's really [like] right at the point of the [elbow], right at right at the tip of it.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  and it just it [hurt hurts] anytime I [move] it.\n[doctor]  Anytime I [move] it, do you [remember] [falling]?\n[patient]  Now I don't [think] so, but my kid [got] pretty rough with me and was checking me several times with a sick.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  So I could have [got] hit there.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right, yeah, that, that, that definitely makes [sense]. So how would you describe the [pain]? Is it like a [dull pain]? Is it stabbing? What would you say?\n[patient]  It's a pretty [sharp pain].\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  Anytime I [move].\n[doctor]  Okay, and does it radiate down your [arm] or does it stay in that one spot?\n[patient]  It radiates down the [forearm].\n[doctor]  Radiates down the form. Alright, so have you taken any [medications] for it to make it better?\n[patient]  I tried taking aval couple of days, but I usually just [forget] about it.\n[doctor]  Okay, when you took a did it, did it help it all, did it change your [pain score]?\n[patient]  Yeah, I [think] it helps some.\n[doctor]  Okay, that's good alright, so we'll do a physical exam on that [elbow]. We'll take a [look] at it in a second. But I do want to [talk] to you about your [hypertension] you [came] in today. I know you have passed [medical history] of [hypertension]. Came in today, your [blood pressures], a little bit high. It was a 150 over 7 over 90, which is pretty high today. I [see] you're on 20 of life, Sinopril. Have you been taking that daily?\n[patient]  [Yes].\n[doctor]  Okay, so maybe you just have a little white [coat syndrome]. I know I have that myself. And even though I'm a physician, I still don't [like] to go to the doctor. So I definitely [understand] how about your diet. I know we talked a little bit about that before. And you [said] kind of during the [pandemic], you fell off a little bit, how you've been doing that have you been lowering your [salt intake].\n[patient]  Yeah, but I only eat low [salt] items avoid adding [salt] to [food]. Kind of the whole whole family follows like a Mediterranean diet.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  We try to be pretty good about it.\n[doctor]  Okay, yeah, that's good. That's definitely good. Yeah, I know a [lot] of people during the [pandemic], it was, you know, [sitting] at home and then [eating] more than we should, but that's I'm very [happy] that you've been compliant and you have that low [salt] diet. So let's [talk] about your [diabetes]. I [think] you [see] here on 500 of [Metformin], are you taking that as well, daily?\n[patient]  [Yes].\n[doctor]  Okay, and your [blood sugars], how have they been?\n[patient]  Since I don't take [insulin], I don't check it every day. When I have checked it, it's usually [running] somewhere between 80 to 100.\n[doctor]  Okay, yeah, that's really good, yeah. So that's pretty good. So what we're gonna do, we're gonna get a 1C just to [see] you know that range and its possibility, we can we can you know lower that metform and dosage, but we will do that after your visit then we will take a [look] at that. So let me go ahead and we'll do that quick exam of your [elbow]. But first I want to make sure you're not having any [chest pain] or anything like that.\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  No belly [pain].\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  All right, so [listen] to your [lungs]. So your [lungs] are clear, bilaterally [listened] to your [heart]. So your [heart] exam, you do still have that [grade] 2 out of 6 [systolic ejection murmur], but we know it about that before. So let me take a [look] at your [elbow]. So when I press right here on the [back] of your [elbow], is that [painful].\n[patient]  [Yes].\n[doctor]  Alright, so when I have you, you flex and extend it, it's [painful] does that does that hurt.\n[patient]  [Yes], it does.\n[doctor]  Alright, so your [right elbow] exam shows you have [pain] to palpation of the [electron] on area of the posterior [elbow]. [You] do have [mild pain] with [flexion] and extension, but you do have also normal [range of motion] at that [elbow]. So we did do an [x-ray] before you [came] in and luckily [nothing]'s broken. No [fracture], no bony abnormality. So it's a [normal x-ray], which is really good. So let me just [talk] to you a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so you have a [elbow contusion]. I believe your son did. Hit you with the lacrosse stick and it caused that [pain]. I [see] some [swelling], little [inflammation] there. As well, you have a little bit of a [bruise]. I [think] that's what happens. So for that I know you're having some [pain]. I'm going to prescribe you 800 milligrams of [ibuprofen]. [You] can take that twice a day and that should help with some of that [swelling]. And [pain], I also want you to [ice] it three times a day for 20 minutes at a time that should also help with the [swelling] and [pain]. And just for the time being for the next couple of weeks, just you know maybe you know not [play] lacrosse with your son just to help that [heal] then you can get [back] on the field. So for your [high blood pressure], we're just going to keep you on the [hypertension]. We'll just keep you on that 20 milligrams of lysinoprol. [Looks] like you're doing great with that and your diet. And then for your [diabetes], we will keep you on the 500 milligrams of [metformin]. And we will also get a a1c just to check your levels and [see] if we do need to adjust the [medication] in the future. All right, so do you have any questions for me?\n[patient]  No [sounds] good.\n[doctor]  Alright, so we will [see] you next time and my nurse will be in with those prescriptions.\n[patient]  All right, thank you.",

I mean, I do [love] pizza too, and I [love] chicken minks, but I do [love] them with Dallas Cowboys. Not so much the cheese, but everybody's [got] your preference, but you do have to know you have to watch those, right? [You] can have a little pizza, maybe a little chicken [wings] every now, and then, but you know, when you go to a [lot] of parties on weekends, we have to really watch that, okay?\n[patient]  Yeah, I mean you're wrong about the Cowboys, but yeah, I guess you're right about everything else.\n[doctor]  Okay, thank you. So tell me how are you [feeling] now though?\n[patient]  Mandock, I [feel] good. I was in the hospital a couple of days and they gave me this medicine. Made me go to the bathroom like nobody's business and then they gave me this [water] [pill] through my four and I [think] I'm on different [medication] for my [blood pressure] now too.

It's never a good [experience]. So you know being in a hospital, it's better to be well and be at home and watching your chiefs [play] now have you bought a [blood pressure cuff] at home. I know we talked about that.\n[patient]  [Yes], ma'am, I finally did what you told me to do and I ordered one and it [came] last week I've been checking it about every other day and my [blood pressure] has been really good.\n[doctor]  Good, very good.

And normally your [respiratory rate] is 26. That's [probably] because you're talking to me here, but that's that's all right. And then your O2 [sad] is 99% so that's good. And now on your [neck] exam, there is no jugular venous distension. And so that's good on your [heart] exam. I appreciate a two out of six histolic [ejection murmur], which I have heard this before. And it's stable. So we will just keep on monitoring that. Okay, now your [lungs] here. Let me [listen]. Okay, they're clear bilaterally. And let me take a [look] at your [legs] real quick here, Kevin. Okay, so your [lower extremities]. They do show a trace of [edema] so that that's going to be that where. Gonna be [able] to help that with the [water pills] that you're taking. Okay.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Now I did review the results of your echocardiogram, which shows a preserved EF of 55% [abnormal] diastolic filling and also mild to moderate [mitral regurgitation]. So what all that means? Let me go ahead and tell you about my assessment and plan. So for your first [problem] of your you know [congestive heart failure], it [sounds] like this was caused by you know dietary and discretion in an uncontrolled [hypertension]. So what I want to do is I want you to continue on [Bumex] 2 milligrams one daily. That's that [water] [pill] that you're talking about. And then I want you to continue to watch your diet and also avoid salty foods. I know you [love] your pizza and chicken [wings], but we're going to have to [cut back] on those okay Kevin.\n[patient]  All right.\n[doctor]  All right now I want you to weigh yourself though every day and then call me if you gain [like] three pounds in two days okay.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Okay, now I do want you to [see] a nutritionist too, and give you some [education] about what foods you can eat.\n[patient]  Alright, [sounds] good.\n[doctor]  All right now for your second [problem] of [hypertension], I do want you to continue on that COZAR 100 milligrams daily and then also continue on that Norvask 5 milligrams once daily.

Hi, Julie. How are you doing?\n[patient]  I'm okay.\n[doctor]  So I know I know you're [worried] about you know what's been happening with you are with your you know with your [blood] [cholesterol]. So can you tell me a little bit more about what's going on.\n[patient]  Yeah, I mean I'm [worried] about this [finding] I went for my annual checkup and they checked my [cholesterol] one of those [finger] [prick] tests and it [came] [back] elevated and they told me I should come and [see] you.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right. [Well], I [think] it's a good thing that you know we're aware of this [elevated cholesterol] at a young [age] and that we can do something about it. So let me ask you, Julia, a couple of questions here. Okay. So what kind of [activities] do you [like] to do?\n[patient]  While I really [like] to go outside, I ride my bicycle a [lot].\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  which is a [lot] of fun I ride the trails.\n[doctor]  That's fun, very nice.

But even after that, I mean, I try to eat pretty clean diet most days.\n[doctor]  Yeah\n[patient]  That's why I was really surprised my [cholesterol] was high.\n[doctor]  Yeah, okay, well we will try to [look] check and [see] what's going on there, okay? So, so what kind of so have you done any fun [activities] that now that you know it's getting [warm] out?\n[patient]  Yeah, I went for a bike ride over the weekend and some friends have [mourning] we went for a bike ride and then we had a pick.\n[doctor]  That's fun!\n[patient]  It was pretty nice, it was a little chilly, but it's nice now that it's springtime.\n[doctor]  Yeah, but yeah, that [sounds] like fun.\n[patient]  It was fun.\n[doctor]  Techniques are fun, so tell me do you have any [history] at all of you know hyper-[cholesterol] serolinemia on the [like] at an early [age]? Any other you know family members that that you [remember] that may have that [problem]?\n[patient]  Why don't really [think]? So I don't really [talk] to my parents too much.\n[doctor]  I know.\n[patient]  But I have a pretty good relationship with my grandparents.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  [You] know, and I [remember] talking to my grandmother and my grandfather both, and they don't they [said] that when they were young they didn't have anything like that. So I had mine checked last year and the doctor [said] it was a little borderline.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  But it wasn't anything to be [worried] about that time. It kind of just blew it off. Just told me to watch what I was [eating]. And now they say it's really hot. And I don't [understand] what's going on.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right, okay. [Well], we'll we'll we'll take a [look] at that. Okay. Now tell me have you had any issues you know with growing growing up [bones] or [feeling] okay? [You] [feel] like you're growing okay.\n[patient]  I guess so I mean when I met with my doctor I they talked about making health goals and making sure that that I [feel] okay and I decided about two years ago that I don't [feel] much like a girl I [said] more just kind of non-[gender] and that's how I've been living\n[doctor]  Yeah\n[patient]  But I mean I thought I was healthy.\n[doctor]  Yeah, okay, well, you know, we can get you there too. [You] know, we can work on that. So we will [talk] more about some tips to help achieve those goals, okay?\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Okay, and tell me does anyone at home [smoke]?\n[patient]  I want to use to [live] with my parents they did, but I [live] on my own now.\n[doctor]  Right.\n[patient]  Nobody smokes my apartment.\n[doctor]  Okay, you know if your friends come over if they [smoke] too, or what okay?\n[patient]  Nope.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  No nobody that I spend time with [smoke].\n[doctor]  Okay, now tell me is there any [history] at all of [like] maybe [heart disease] or [sudden death], you know, like early early in those your family's years?\n[patient]  [Well] come to [think] of it, I did have my grandparents told me that I had a cousin that [died]. And he was only [like] 44-45.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  Did they [think] that he had a [heart attack]?\n[doctor]  Okay, well, I'm sorry to [hear] that okay. So that's that's helpful information though. Okay, let's go ahead and do physical exam on you there. Julie, I'm going to go ahead and take a [look] at your [vital signs]. [Looks] like your [blood pressure] looks good. So that's good. Now in your [heart] exam, I don't appreciate any [murmur] rubs or gallops on your [lung] exam. Your [lungs] are clear on your [eye] exam. I don't appreciate any zentomas and also on your [neck] exam. Here there is no [thyroid] megaly. So now on your [abdominal] exam, I don't appreciate any [hepatomegaly] or [splenomegaly]. Why can I [see] these today? So I reviewed the results of your [cholesterol level] and it was elevated at 2 10. So that's high. So let me go ahead and tell you about my plan. So for your [problem] of [elevated cholesterol], what we want to do is you know the American Academy of Pediatrics actually recommends that all children be screen screened once you know they become between ages and 9 and 11 and then again between ages 17 and 20. So that's why you were screened. Okay, so we do we [yes]. So we do this because studies have shown a link between [high cholesterol] and premature [heart attacks]. So I want to go ahead and order full [cholesterol] panel. There could be other reasons that could be causing the [high cholesterol]. But I'll go ahead also and check some [glucose] a complete metabolic panel some [thyroid] studies and [liver] panels and I want to perform a genetic testing to [see] if this [problem] is familial or this is a [secondary]. So we're also going to go ahead. I want to follow up in a follow up with a well balanced diet. So including a variety of foods that are lower in [saturated] [fat] and [sugars]. So I want you to follow that and I want you to meet a nutritionist and so who can give you information about what kind of foods to eat? Okay.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  All right, now I do want you to continue to be active and exercise, so that's great especially that you know your [bike riding], so you keep that up, that's a great thing, and you're doing well with that, so keep that up for you okay. And then I want to follow up with another [cholesterol level] in three to six months after you've met with a nutritionist, and then, and they've you know instituted those dietary changes.\n[patient]  Okay, it [sounds] good.\n[doctor]  Okay, good well take [care], Julie, I'll [talk] to you soon.\n[patient]  Alright, thanks document.\n[doctor]  Thank you bye.",

            "src": "[doctor]  So Elizabeth is a 53 year old [female] today complaining of [chest pain] and she has a [past medical history] of [diabetes] and [high blood pressure]. So Elizabeth tell me what's going on with your [chest pain].\n[patient]  [I don't know] every time I start [walking], I'm just having this kind of [pressure] and [chest pain] in my [chest].\n[doctor]  OK, are you having it now or is it gone right now?\n[patient]  Right now it's not there.\n[doctor]  Okay, and how long have you been having this?\n[patient]  [Probably] maybe three months.\n[doctor]  Okay, and what seemed to bring it on anything [exacerbated] or relieve it.\n[patient]  It mainly happens when I'm [walking] I [like] to try and walk, but lately I just haven't been [able] to keep up with it because I'm having this [pain].\n[doctor]  Alright, and well how would you describe this [pain]? It's like a dull [pain sharp] [pain stabbing] [pain]. How would you describe it?\n[patient]  I would say it's dull, it's kind of like a [pressure].\n[doctor]  Okay, and does it go anywhere or radiate any place?\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  Okay, alright, but no [chest pain] right now, no [shortness of breath], no [sweats], or claminess, or anything like that right now.\n[patient]  [Nothing] right now.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right. [Well], certainly you know I looked at your EKG that did we did in the office. When you [came] in the EKG, I don't [see] any signs of a [heart attack] or anything like that. So I mean, we should definitely [talk] about the plan for this [chest pain] in a few minutes. But right now the good news is I don't [see] any signs of a [heart attack] or anything like that. So let's [talk] a little bit about your other conditions since you are here today. How are you doing with your [diabetes]? I know we have you on that foreman. And we talked about last time about you know improving your diet and exercise. I'm glad you're exercising, but I'm so sorry to [hear] about the [chest pain]. So tell me about how is that going.\n[patient]  Yeah, I mean I [think] my [blood sugars] have been a little higher because I haven't been [able] to be active and I'm trying with the diet [You] know I do [love] sodas, so I'm really trying strengthos\n[doctor]  Yeah, I am addicted to diet coke myself. So I [hear] you on that one. And we had checked your [hemoglobin], a 1C last time it was, you know, 7. Which is pretty good. It's not, you know, it could be better, but it's not, it's not bad. And we talked about sending you to ophthalmology also for an [eye] exam. Have you seen ophthalmology in the last few months or last before I [saw] you?\n[patient]  I had an appointment in two weeks, it was a long waiting.\n[doctor]  Okay, [got] it. And any [nausea] [vomiting] or [diarrhea] or anything like that with your [diabetes] or any [side effects] from your [medications] that met foreman.\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right, good. And I [saw] also there was a record in your, I was looking at your record before previously, before I walked and you also had, we've been checking your [blood pressure]. But, but I [think] you've been into several other clinicians and they had documented [high blood pressure]. Have you noticed any findings with that? Or have you know, have anybody talked about [high blood pressure] with you or mentioned that? Because we don't have it in our system here. Yet, but I did add it in today, but we don't. Have you on any [medications] yet for that?\n[patient]  No, I mean, [I don't know]. Doc, no one told me about [high blood pressure]. Do I have [high blood pressure]?\n[doctor]  [Well], I [think] the last time you were in the clinic and one of the clinics [said] the referrals the [blood pressure] was elevated, so they had mentioned that I noticed a trend in your [blood pressure]. It's been [running] on a little bit on the high side. We haven't really diagnosed you with that yet, but I [think] we are something that we should definitely consider looking at your trend of your [blood pressure] readings over the last, you know, a few years.\n[patient]  Okay, do you [think] that could be causing me my [chest pain]?\n[doctor]  It certainly could be contributing to that. It certainly could be a factor that we need to [look] at so.\n[patient]  Someone had told me before.\n[doctor]  Yummy too, but we can definitely get you started on some monitoring devices for that. And also maybe start you on some diet control things that we can do to help with the [blood pressure]. And maybe start you on some [blood pressure] [medications] if we need to okay.\n[patient]  Okay [sounds] good.\n[doctor]  So let me examine you Elizabeth for a second for the because we're [running] out of time here for a second. So I'm going to go ahead and do my exam. We [got] taught just in my magical exam and I'm going to go ahead and verbalize some of my findings just so I can get it documented in my note. Okay. And I'll explain things as we go along. So there is no [JVD]. There is no [swelling] in your [neck]. There's no [carotid] roots. [You]'re long exam is clear. I don't [hear] any [crackles] or a ronky or hard exam. [You] do have a two over six. It's a stalacic [ejection murmur]. [You] had that in the past. Otherwise, it's regular rate and [rhythm]. Your pulses are equal. Your belly exam is nice and soft. [You]'re no [tenderness]. No guarding. No masses that I can [feel] on your belly and your [back] exam is fine. Your [extremity] exam. [You] have a little bit of [swelling] in your [lower legs]. [One plus] [non-pitting edema] or [swelling] in the in your [ankle] area. Here, no [calf] [tenderness]. So what does all this mean? I'll explain that in a second. So basically your exam is pretty normal except for you have a little bit of [swelling] in your [legs]. So you know what this [chest pain], I'm a little bit. So the first diagnosis that we [talk] about is this [chest pain] I'm [worried] about my [suspicion] is you have something called [unstable] in China, especially considering your [history] of [diabetes] and the suspected [history] of [high blood pressure] and your [family history of heart disease] in the past as well. I'm going to go ahead and refer you to cardiology. I reviewed your EKG today. So that looks normal. So that's good. No other signs of a [heart attack]. But I am [worried] that you may have some [sort] of a [blockage] going on that's causing this [chest pain]. I'm going to go ahead and start you on some [aspirin] daily. I'm also going to give you a prescription just a baby [aspirin]. [You] can take 81 milligrams once a day. And also I'm going to give you a prescription for [nitroglycerin]. It's a little [pill] you split underneath your [tongue]. [You] have this [chest pain] if it doesn't go away. After one or two [pills], I want you to go to the hospital call. 9-1-1 and go to the hospital. But we will try to get you into cardiology the next week and get you [set] up for some [sort] of a [stress] [test] to [look] at your [heart]. Okay, any questions about that?\n[patient]  So anytime I have a [chest pain], even if I'm just like [walking] I have to take that [pill].\n[doctor]  Yeah, if you stop [walking] the [chest pain] goes away, you don't have to take the [pill], but if you are [walking] or you stop and the [chest pain] does not go away, I would take the [pill] and [see] if it goes away if it is not.\n[patient]  How long do I wait to [see] if it goes away?\n[doctor]  about five minutes so you can take it up to three [pills] every five minutes. And if it doesn't go away then I would you know go to the hospital and get this checked out because I [worry] about with this [chest pain] that you're having making sure it doesn't [lead] to a [heart attack]. Those [chest pain] could be a you know AA sign that you may be having some less [blood flow] to your [heart] and we need to get that checked out pretty quickly.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Alright.\n[patient]  MM\n[doctor]  And for the second [problem], the [diabetes], you know, I [think] you're doing fairly well, continue with your [eye]-off-themology appointment you have for your [eye] exam for the [diabetic retinopathy]. Continue the [metformin] 500 milligrams twice a day. I'm going to order another [hemoglobin] A1c today. And I'm going to have you come [back] in about two weeks and we can [see] if we need to make any adjustments continue to try to stay away. From you know that the pop and the [sweet] things and once we have your [heart], take in [care] of or make sure your [heart] is okay, you can and we can hopefully resolve this [chest pain] that you're having get [back] to your exercise regimen. Okay, any questions about that?\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  Okay, and for the third diagnosis, the [high blood pressure], you do have a trend I've noticed in your [chart] that your [blood pressure] has been [running] a little bit high, several other people have documented. As well, I'm going to go ahead and start you on some [hydrochlorothiazide]. It's a pretty low dose [medication] to help you with your [blood pressure] plus. It'll also help with you some of the [swelling] you have in your [feet]. I'm going to have you use a [blood pressure cuff] at home and enter your findings at Epic MyCard. And I'll get a reading of those as well. And then what when you come [back] in two weeks will keep a log of your [blood pressure] daily in the morning when you [wake] up and [see] how things are going. And then if we need to make any adjustments to the [medications] we can but especially considering your [history] and the [chest pain] and the [diabetes] and the [swelling], I [think] starting this [hydrochlorothiazide] is [probably] a good idea.\n[patient]  Okay, are there any [side effects] with this [medication]?\n[doctor]  Yeah, it can cause, sometimes it can cause a little bit of make you go to the bathroom, a little bit more often in the evening. But generally, most people don't have a whole [lot] of [side effects]. I'll give you a [hand] out of the [side effects]. But sometimes you can have a cross-reaction with some [other medications] like sulfamedications. But generally, most people tolerate this pretty well.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  All right, any other questions we [got]?\n[patient]  That's it.\n[doctor]  Alright well great [seeing] you thanks for coming in today.\n[patient]  Thank you appreciate it.",

Chest pain.\n- Medical Reasoning: Considering her history of diabetes, possible history of hypertension, and family history of heart disease, I suspect her chest pain is likely unstable angina. Her recent EKG was unremarkable and there are no other signs of heart attack, but I am worried she may have some sort of a blockage causing her pain.\n- Patient Education and Counseling: We discussed proper protocol for sublingual nitroglycerin for chest pain. I advised her to go to the emergency department if the medication is not effective after approximately 5 minutes.\n- Medical Treatment: We will have her start a regimen of baby aspirin at 81 mg daily, for which I have sent in a prescription today. I also sent a prescription for nitroglycerin up to 3 tablets every 5 minutes as needed. Finally, I am going to have her follow up with cardiology for further evaluation.\n\n2.

In the meantime, I want her to continue with metformin 500 mg twice daily and dietary modifications.\n\n3. Hypertension.\n- Medical Reasoning: Several providers, including myself, have noted a trend of elevated blood pressures in the patient's chart.\n- Patient Education and Counseling: I advised the patient to monitor her blood pressures at home over the next 2 weeks and report her readings to me via MyChart. This should help us determine if any adjustments need to be made to her new medications. We discussed the possible side effects of hydrochlorothiazide how this will hopefully reduce some of her swelling seen on physical exam. All of her questions were answered.\n- Medical Treatment: I'm going to have her start hydrochlorothiazide at a low dose.\n\nPatient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nThe patient will follow up in 2 weeks.",

And sometimes I can even [hear] what seems like some creaking in my [knees].\n[doctor]  All right, now tell me what type of [activities] makes that [pain] [worse].\n[patient]  So I [feel] like the [pain] gets [worse] anytime. I'm like getting from like a seated position to standing. So I work from home. Some of my desk a [lot]. So anytime I get up I have some [pain] or after watching TV or even like going up and downstairs it's really [painful].\n[doctor]  Okay, and does anything make the [pain] [feel] better?\n[patient]  [Usually] after I rest it for some time, it does help with the [pain].\n[doctor]  Okay, now you did mention earlier that you have tried some things in the past can you tell me what they were.\n[patient]  [Yes], when it first started hurting, I was putting [ice] on it. And I even [got] [like] some [ace bandage] like wrapping from the pharmacy. I do take [ibuprofen] or a leaf sometimes, but I try to avoid really taking any [medications].\n[doctor]  Okay, and tell me what is your day like?\n[patient]  [Well], I try to be as active as I can I actually [love] to [run] and I would [run] like five to six miles a day, but now I mean honestly, I can't even get a half a mile and my [leg] will start hurting my [knee] will start hurting.\n[doctor]  Okay, that's definitely a decrease in your mileage. There were have you been [running] lately [like] do you [run] outside or on a treadmill or?\n[patient]  Yeah, I know I will do the treadmill during the winter, but I just [love] being outdoors and [running].\n[doctor]  Yeah, yeah, there are some really nice senior routes here in [Boston], isn't there like?\n[patient]  There are.\n[doctor]  So many [new] places there's some right by the harbor that I've done some [runs] there before too. It's pretty nice. [Well], I mean the [Boston] Marathon. What can you say, right?\n[patient]  Right, exactly, exactly know it's very nice.\n[doctor]  [Well], okay, well, hopefully that we get you [feeling better], so you can start [running] again more then. Five miles, but tell me though, have you noticed any [swelling] or [redness] in your [knees]?\n[patient]  [No, not really].\n[doctor]  Okay, and have you ever injured your [knees] before?\n[patient]  No, I've been pretty good. I actually have never [broken a bone]. Actually, no, I'm going to change that. Actually, I did break my [arm] when I was in sixth [grade], but [nothing] since then.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  Bye.\n[doctor]  Okay, and it's just your [arm], right not not your [knee].\n[patient]  Right?\n[doctor]  Okay, well, all right. [Well], let's go ahead and do a quick physical exam on you. Here, let me [look] at your [vital signs]. Okay. I reviewed your vitals. They, they overall, they [look] good. Take a [listen] to your [heart] real quick. All right. And your [heart] exam. I [hear] regular rate and [rhythm] with no [murmurs]. And on your musculoskeletal exam, I have seen you and walk around here. And you do have normal gate. All right. Now I'm going to have you do some movements on your [legs] here. Okay.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  All right, good your strength is three out of five for [abduction] of [legs] bilaterally, and the remainder of [muscle strength] for your [lower extremities] are five out of five. So that's good. Let me take a [look] at your [knee] now on your [knee] exam. There is no overlying [erythema] that's [redness] or echinosis, and that's [bruising] or any [warmth] of the [skin] appreciated. There is no [effusion]. Let me go ahead and [feel] around here. [Does] that hurt right here? How does that [feel]?\n[patient]  It does.\n[doctor]  Sorry, so there is [tenderness] to palpation of the bilateral redinacular redinaculum, and there is [positive] patellar grine [test] all right. And can you are you [able] to [squat] for me?\n[patient]  I can but that hurts.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right. So you're definitely having some [knee pain] with [squatting], and I'm just going to maneuver your [leg] just a little bit here real quick. Okay. So lock my anterior and posterior drawer and McMurray tests are all [negative] bilaterally. So that's good there. Okay. Now your neuroexamptella and [Achilles] [reflexes] are [symmetrical]. All right. So now I did review the results of your [x-ray] and both of your [knees], which shows no [fractures] or [osteoarthritis]. So let me go ahead and tell you about my assessment and plan. So for your [problem] of [bilateral knee pain] based on what you told me your exam and reviewing your MRI, your [symptoms] are consistent with [patella] [femoral] [pain syndrome]. And this is a very common [condition] that we [see] that causes [knee pain] especially in active young people. So this [condition] has to do with the way your [knee] [cap], which is your [patella], how that [moves] along the [groove] of your [thigh] or [thigh bone], which is the [femur] now for the [pain] you may continue taking [ibuprofen] or anti-inflammatory as needed to help with the [pain]. But I'm also going to recommend physical therapy where where they will show you a number of [lower extremity] exercises. And this will help increase your [lower extremities], strength, your [mobility] and correct any incorrect [running] [mechanics] that you may have. So do you have any questions for me about that?\n[patient]  while I'll be [able] to [run] anytime soon.\n[doctor]  [Well], that is a goal of treatment and to get you [back] and [running] again, now you will have to take and take it [easy] from [running] for now, but we will continue to assess your progress with each visit okay.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Alright, anything else.\n[patient]  No, I [think] that's it.\n[doctor]  Okay, well very good while I will be following up with you soon, and again just take it [easy] for now from the [running] okay.\n[patient]  Okay, thank you.\n[doctor]  Bye.\n[patient]  Bye.",

So what is your [like], how what is your [activity level] right now that I know that you know in a lintic weightlifter with books, what else do you do to [like] exercise?\n[patient]  [You] know, I try to exercise a few times a week, but I'm pretty inconsistent. I have a [sedentary] job.\n[doctor]  Okay, alright, and has this like [pain] started to [like] [affect] you [like] in your job or anything like that?\n[patient]  Not my job, but I [feel] like I don't want to be as active as I was previously.\n[doctor]  Alright, so do you have any family members that have [spine] conditions?\n[patient]  Yeah, my dad is [back pain].\n[doctor]  Okay, all right, and then do you [smoke]?\n[patient]  I don't [smoke].\n[doctor]  Okay, awesome alright. So sorry one question did you have a [history] of [playing] sports?\n[patient]  [Yes].\n[doctor]  Okay, what did you [play]?\n[patient]  soccer\n[doctor]  Okay, what position?\n[patient]  I [played] midfield.\n[doctor]  Okay, the people who hide in the [back] that's fine, I was centered forward, fine, no baby. Do you have a team that you wrote for?\n[patient]  [You] know I'm a Tatinum Hotspur fan.\n[doctor]  They have the best colors not going to lie, but I grew up Monu so sorry.\n[patient]  [Well], I won't fault you for that.\n[doctor]  Thanks, okay. So if you don't [mind], I'm gonna go ahead and do my physical exam. I'm gonna call out my findings just to have them recorded. And if you have any questions, please [feel] free to stop me and let me know, okay?\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Alright, so looking at your vitals, your [blood pressure], seems alright, we are in [like] the 130 over 70 range that's perfectly fine your [respiratory rate]. I have you at an 18 again, pretty normal. When I [listen] here to your [heart], you have a regular rate. And [rhythm], I don't appreciate any [murmurs], rubs, or gallops that means your [heart sounds] great on your respiratory exam, your [lung sound], clear to osculation bilaterally on your. [Musculoskeletal] [back] exam, as I'm looking here, I don't. Notice any overlying [redness] or [bruising] on the [skin] when I push here on the [midline] of your [back], does it hurt?\n[patient]  [Yes].\n[doctor]  Okay, so there is [midline] [tenderness] at the L4 L5 [disc] space with right-sided lumbar pair of [vertebral] [tenderness]. Alright, so are you [able] to [bend] forward?\n[patient]  [Yes].\n[doctor]  Alright, and are you [able] to [bend] backward?\n[patient]  [Yes].\n[doctor]  Alright, do either of those actions cause you [pain].\n[patient]  [bending] forward\n[doctor]  Okay, so [pain] with lumbar [flexion] and so I'm going to have you lie down and we're going to do I'm sorry, okay, and then I [see] that a supine straight [like] [test] is [positive]. All right, so for your neurological exam you [said] that you are experiencing [pain radiating] down, radiating down your [left leg] correct.\n[patient]  [Yes].\n[doctor]  All right, when I [touch], are there any [like] [decreased sensation]?\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right, so [patella] and [Achilles] [reflexes] are [symmetrical], all right. So I received before you [came] in here, we [got] an MRI. And so in reviewing your results, it does show a [disc] [desiccation], a [disc] [bulge] with paracentral [disc] [herniation] resulting in moderate right neuro-feraminal. I don't [like] this word neuro-feraminal [stenosis]. What those complicated words is that I just [said] is that it seems that you have AA, [herniated disc] with [nerve] impingement. So let's [talk] about my assessment and plan all right. Your [symptoms] are in line with I'm sorry you have [lumbar back pain] at the L4 L5 [disc] space due to a [herniated disc] with ridiculous [apathy]. This means that one of your discs that [sits] between your [vertebrae] like the [bones] in your [spine] is [bulging] out and the [bulge] is [pinching] on some [nerves]. So that's why you're [feeling] that [pain] like radiating down your [leg]. I'm going to recommend something a spinal [injection] with a strong end [said] and called the I'm sorry and a [corticosteroid]. I'm just going to inject it into the [lumbar spine] under fluoroscopy, which you can [think] of [like] an [x-ray] to localize the [exact] area of your [pain]. This should help with the [inflammation] that's causing your [pain]. I know that [sounds] a bit scary at this is a typical procedure that I do all the time. It's an office and we can get you scheduled today if you would [like]. So what questions do you have right now?\n[patient]  Is that something that we can do today?\n[doctor]  Yeah, I [think] I have time in my schedule to get a done today, just you know I'm here for you right now.\n[patient]  All right.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  Are there any [complications] with this?\n[doctor]  There are, sorry, yeah, you're right, there are risks associated with this kind of [injection], just like any procedure, but we aim to minimize them. And my mom, when she comes in, we will give you some paperwork with explanations and any and hopefully answer most of the questions that you have. If after reading that you have any more questions, please [feel] free to stop us. We want to make sure that you [feel] as comfortable as [possible] during this time.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Alright.\n[patient]  Great.\n[doctor]  Anything else?\n[patient]  I [think] that's it.\n[doctor]  Alright.",
            "tgt": "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nKyle Morales is a pleasant 58-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of low back pain.\n\nOnset of his pain began 2 weeks ago, when he was lifting a box of books and felt a pop. The pain is described as aching and sharp. His pain has been increasing since the time of onset and is beginning to radiate down his left leg. The patient denies any pain with sitting. He adds that he has a sedentary job. The patient states that his pain does not affect his job, however he feels that he does not want to be as active as he was previously. He tries to exercise a few times per week, however he is inconsistent. He denies any numbness, tingling, loss of sensation, weakness, and loss of control of his bladder or bowels.\n\nThe patient has been taking ibuprofen and Tylenol for pain, which provides some relief. He has not been evaluated for surgery.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nHe denies smoking. The patient has a history of playing soccer in the midfield position.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY\n\nThe patient states that his father has back pain.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nMusculoskeletal: Reports low back pain.\nNeurological: Denies bowl or bladder control issues, numbness, tingling, decreased sensations, or weakness.\n\nVITALS\n\nBlood pressure: 130/70 mm Hg.\nRespiratory rate: 18.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nCV: I do not appreciate any murmurs, rubs, or gallops.\nRESPIRATORY: Normal respiratory effort no respiratory distress. Clear to auscultation, bilaterally.\nBACK: No evidence of trauma or deformity\nNEURO: Normal sensation. Patellar and Achilles reflexes are symmetrical.\nMSK: Examination of the lumbar spine: No ecchymosis noted. Midline tenderness at the L4-5 disc space with right-sided lumbar paravertebral tenderness. Pain with lumbar flexion. Positive supine straight leg test.\n\nRESULTS\n\nThe MRI of the lumbar spine was reviewed today. It revealed disc desiccation and a disc bulge with a paracentral disc herniation resulting in moderate right neural foraminal stenosis.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nLumbar back pain at the L4-5 disc space due to a herniated disc with radiculopathy.\n\nPLAN\n\nAfter reviewing the patient's examination and MRI findings today, I have discussed with the patient that his MRI revealed a herniated disc with radiculopathy. We discussed treatment options for this and I have recommended that we begin with conservative treatment in the form of a corticosteroid injection. With the patient's consent, we will proceed with a corticosteroid injection into the lumbar spine today. The patient was made aware of the risks of bleeding, infection, nerve damage, blood vessel damage, reaction to the medication, including skin changes, swelling, and also, the risk of elevated glucose levels if the patient were diabetic.",

            "src": "[doctor]  Angela, good to [see] you today. So I'm writing here in my notes that you're coming and you had some [left knee pain]. So how did you hurt your [knee]?\n[patient]  Yeah, so I hurt my [knee] the other day when I was [running] around with my niece. She is [learning] how to take off the training wheels for her bike.\n[doctor]  Hmm.\n[patient]  And I fell and I [think] I twisted my [knee] in some kind of funky way.\n[doctor]  Okay, that's not good how old are your [knees].\n[patient]  She's 5 and perfect.\n[doctor]  [Well], that's good that you're trying to help her with the [learning] how to ride a bike.\n[patient]  Yeah.\n[doctor]  That [sounds] fun, but I'm [sad] as you hurt your [knee] doing it. So for your [knee pain], are you [able] to bear [weight] on that [leg the left] [leg]?\n[patient]  While I've been [limping] ever since, and it really hasn't gotten better, so I thought it was maybe time to come [see] you because it happened about a week ago.\n[doctor]  Yeah, yeah, it's definitely a good time to come [see] me, so what part of your [knee] would you say it hurts?\n[patient]  Honestly, it's been hurting on both sides more so on the inside than the outside.\n[doctor]  So, okay, so more in the medial aspect, less on the lateral, okay, that makes [sense]. And you [said] did you [hear] a pop when you when you twisted it?\n[patient]  Yeah, I did.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right, so how would you rate your [pain] with your [knee] out of out of one to ten?\n[patient]  It started off as like a four, but I [think] it's getting [worse] and it's starting [like] it's like a throbbing kind of [pain], yeah.\n[doctor]  Alright, and have you taken anything for the [pain]?\n[patient]  Yeah, so I [like] a [ulcer] not too long ago. So my doctor told me that I couldn't take any [like] kind of adveau or [ibuprofen].\n[doctor]  Hmm.\n[patient]  So I've been taking some [Tylenol] and I wrapped it with Kinneziology [tape]. Are you familiar with that?\n[doctor]  Yep, yeah, I'm familiar.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Alright, and has the Has the IBi Profin been helping you at all?\n[patient]  I can't take [ibuprofen].\n[doctor]  I mean I'm sorry the [Tylenol].\n[patient]  No, it's okay, but the [Tylenol] helps like a little bit, but you know, [like] it's like a time limit right, so by the time, and I'm not supposed to take it like more than [like] every [like] four hours or something like that, but by hour two, like it hurts again.\n[doctor]  Okay, yet that yeah, you can't take too much of that [Tylenol] because it'll mess up your [liver] definitely.\n[patient]  Right?\n[doctor]  Alright, so go ahead and do a quick exam on your [knee] here. So when I press here, does that hurt?\n[patient]  [You] [like] when you press on the inside that hurts a [lot]?\n[doctor]  Okay, all right, I'm going to do a couple of other maneuvers here for your [knee]. So on your [left knee] exam, I do appreciate some [edema]. [You] also have some [effusion], some fluid in the [knee]. [You] have moderate [range of motion]. So you're [able] to [move] it a little bit, but not all the way. I also [see] you have some [pain] on [flexion] and [extension of the knee], even [negative] lockments [test] and a [negative] valgus and baris [test] as well. So all that to say is I don't [think] anything is as [torn] in your [knee] based on the your physical exam. So we did do a [x-ray] of your [left knee] and luckily it was normal. So there is no [fractures], no bony abnormalities. So everything is good there. So let me [talk] to you a little bit about my assessment and plan for your [knee] okay.\n[patient]  Yeah.\n[doctor]  All right, so for your [left knee pain], I believe you have an MCL [strain] or a medial [collateral ligament] that's the inside of your [knee], I [think] when you were [running] with your [knee], she had somehow twisted it. And so you [strain] that [ligament] there. So for that, what I want to do, I'm going to give you some [pain medication] that's not an N-side. So I will put you on some tram at all. [You] can take 50 milligrams. [You] can do that twice a day. And then you can take that [Tylenol] as needed for breakthrough. [Pain] all right. I'm going to put you in a [knee immobilizer], [leg] [knee immobilizer]. And you can wear that for the next week. I just want to keep the [knee] for [moving] so it can [heal] a little bit and reduce some of the [inflammation] that you're [seeing] here. And I also want you to [ice] it. And you can do that three or four times a day for 20, 30 minutes at a time. And that should help some of that [swelling] as well. And I know I know your niece is going to be [upset], but I just don't want you to be [running]. [Probably] for the next three weeks, with her just to help us get time to let allow the [knee] to [heal]. So how does that [sound]?\n[patient]  That's alright, how long do you [think] it'll be before I can [run] or something like that?\n[doctor]  Hmm, I [think] you'll be [back] to normal in about a month, the [strain] doesn't seem too bad, but we just need to get you off of the [knee], so we can allow it to [heal]. I mean, once we do that, you know along with you know the icing, the mobilization, and you're [taking the medication], I [think] you'll be good to go in a month. If you do [feel] like you're getting a little bit [worse], please [feel] free to call the office, and we can get you in and possibly do more imaging such as an MRI to you notice [see] if it's anything. Worst, but I don't [think] it is, but just let us know how you [feel] in a couple of days.\n[patient]  Okay, all right, thanks.\n[doctor]  All right, any other questions?\n[patient]  No, that's it.\n[doctor]  Alright, great thanks!",
            "tgt": "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nAngela Powell is a pleasant 81-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of left knee pain. The onset of her pain began 1 week ago, when she was running around with her niece and fell. At the time of the injury, she heard a pop and believes that she twisted her knee. She reports that she has been limping since the injury. The patient locates her pain to the medial and lateral aspects of her knee. She rates her pain level as a 4 out of 10, however this is increasing. Her pain is described as a throbbing pain. The patient has been taking Tylenol, which has provided mild and temporary relief, as well as wrapping her knee with kinesiology tape. She states that she is unable to take ibuprofen secondary to an ulcer.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nMSK: Examination of the left knee: Edema and effusion noted. Moderate ROM. Pain with flexion and extension of the knee. Negative Lachman's. Negative valgus and varus stress test.\n\nRESULTS\n\n4 views of the left knee were taken. These reveal no evidence of any fractures or dislocations. No other abnormalities are noted.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nLeft knee pain, possible MCL strain.\n\nPLAN\n\nAfter reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have discussed with the patient that her x-rays did not reveal any signs of a tear. I have recommended that we treat the patient conservatively. The plan is to place the patient in a knee immobilizer to provide increased support for the next week. I have also prescribed the patient tramadol 50 mg to treat her pain. She can take Tylenol as needed for breakthrough pain. I have also advised her to ice her left knee 3 to 4 times a day for 20 to 30 minutes at a time. I have advised her to refrain from running for the next 3 weeks. If her pain does not improve with the immobilizer, I will recommend obtaining an MRI.\n",
