aci,ACI001,"[doctor]  Hey George, how are you today? I understand you're here for some numbness and tingling in your fingers and some pain in your wrist.
[patient]  Right my left wrist and hand has been bothering me probably for a few months now with pain and numbness.
[doctor]  Okay, and you said that's been ongoing for several months, do you know what caused this type of pain? Or is it just something that started slowly or?
[patient]  It just kind of started on its own it. I noticed it mostly at night.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  Sometimes it will all wake up and my hands are asleep and I got to shake it out.
[doctor]  Shake it out and okay.
[patient]  and then some.
[doctor]  What kind of work do you do?
[patient]  I do yard work.
[doctor]  Yard work.
[patient]  landscaping landscaping.
[doctor]  landscaping okay so a lot of raking a lot of digging so a lot of repetitive type movements
[patient]  Yeah, it's pretty heavy labor, but it's yeah, the same thing day in and day out.
[doctor]  Okay, okay, just a couple questions for you. You did say that you have the pain at night in that, and you have to get that numbness into the hand. Is it in all the fingers?
[patient]  It seems to happen to all my fingers, but I notice it more in my thumb and pointer finger.
[doctor]  Okay, okay. And anything into that little into your fifth finger, your little finger, any numbness they're at times now.
[patient]  Sometimes, yeah, it seems like it's number two.
[doctor]  Okay, what about your right hand? Any problems with that hand?
[patient]  Now I don't seem to have any problems with my right hand, so far it's just mostly my left.
[doctor]  Okay, okay, good. And just a couple, you know, do you have many or do you drink often? Do you have you know many any alcohol consumption?
[patient]  I drink usually a beer or two on Fridays and Saturdays on the weekends.
[doctor]  Okay, and do you have any evidence of anybody ever said that you had some rheumatoid arthritis in your hand or wrist anything like that?
[patient]  Nobody say anything like that, so I mean.
[doctor]  Okay, okay, good. So let me go ahead and do a physical exam here real quick. And you know I'm gonna quickly just listen to your heart and lums, okay? That's good. I'd like you to squeeze. I'm gonna hold your hands here. And I'd like you to squeeze both hands.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  You seem a little bit weaker on that left hand, is that what you've noticed.
[patient]  Yeah, I experienced some weakness in my left hand.
[doctor]  Okay do you find that you're dropping things when you're picking it up is it to that level or?
[patient]  Yeah, I drop things mostly because I have a hard time feeling it.
[doctor]  Okay, okay, good. And so you do have a grip strength is less on the left. And I just want to touch your fingers here on the on the right side, you can feel me touching all the fingers on the right.
[patient]  Yeah, I can say you touch me, but it feels a little more weird on the thumb side than my pointer finger side.
[doctor]  Okay, okay. And I want to turn your wrist over here and turn your hand over. And I'm going to go ahead and tap on the right wrist on the back. Here does that do anything when I do that.
[patient]  I still feel a little jolt or a zing in my fingertips.
[doctor]  Okay, and then when I do that on the left side.
[patient]  Yes, same thing.
[doctor]  Same thing, okay. So you do have a bilateral positive to Nell sign. So here's here's where I'm at, I think, your diagnosis is beginning to have some bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome. Usually we see that with repetitive actions such as the landscaping, the heavy labor, and you know you're your clinical exam. And history sound like it's a carpal tunnel syndrome. I do want to order so where are we going to go from here? I would like to order a study. It's called an EMG where it measures some of that electrical impulses down into your fingers. We will follow up with that. But as far as your treatment, so the treatment for carpal tunnel syndrome is really some activity modification. Now I know you are a landscaper. Is there any way that you could be work to have some lighter work during the time?
[patient]  I suppose I could try to pass it off to some of my other employees and delegate.
[doctor]  Okay, that would be good. So that's I just want you to kind of eliminate that the active repetitive motions that you're doing all the time just for a couple weeks. I'm also going to give you a wrist splint to wear and that should help and I'd like you to take ibuprofen 600 milligrams every six hours and then I want to see you back here in the office in two weeks and in that two week period I think we're going to see if there's need for any other intervention if I need to do more diagnostic testing or if there's a possibly looking at a surgical intervention to release that pressure that's on the nerves in that hand does that sound like a good plan for you.
[patient]  It sounds like a good first start.
[doctor]  Okay, okay, so I just just off off the record. Here, what kind of what do you specialize in landscaping is your company do?
[patient]  Mostly like yard work and maintenance flower beds, not really designing, just upkeep.
[doctor]  Okay, yeah, I'm looking for a landscape designer. I need somebody to put in some elaborate walkways back through the backyard. So, yeah, we can do stuff like that. I mean, if you have an idea, what you want, I think that's easy.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  You know, if you're looking for like some...
[patient]  Backyard Ellis's rehab remodel, that's I mean I suppose we could do we haven't done things like that in a while because we're busy enough with just the up key but it's something to explore.
[doctor]  Okay, I may have to keep that in mind because I do want to do some of that. So let's listen, I'm going to get my nurse in here to discharge you. Do you have any other questions for me before we end this?
[patient]  No, I think it's all clear I appreciate it.
[doctor]  Okay take care and I'll look forward to see you in two weeks.
[patient]  Very good appreciate your time.","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Left wrist and hand pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

George Lewis is a pleasant 57-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for evaluation of left wrist and hand pain. He reports an onset of a few months ago but denies any specific injury. However, the patient notes he often engages in repetitive motions while performing his work duties. His symptoms are worse at night, and he wakes with numbness in the bilateral hands. He experiences numbness in all fingers, but states it is the most noticeable in the left thumb and index finger. He affirms intermittent numbness in the left little finger. For relief, he shakes his hands upon waking. The patient also experiences weakness in his left hand. He reports he drops objects and explains “I have a hard time feeling it.”

MEDICAL HISTORY

The patient denies a history of rheumatoid arthritis.

SOCIAL HISTORY

He works in landscaping. He reports consuming 1 to 2 beers on weekends.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports left wrist and hand pain. Denies right hand pain.
Neurological: Reports numbness in bilateral hands and fingers, and left hand weakness.

PHYSICAL EXAM

NEURO: Decreased sensation in the right thumb and index finger.
MSK: Examination of the bilateral hands: Grip strength is less on the left in comparison to the right. Positive Tinel sign bilaterally.

ASSESSMENT

Bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's clinical history and examination today, I have had a lengthy discussion with him regarding treatment options for his current symptoms. I discussed the importance of activity modification and encouraged the patient to limit active repetitive motions while working for the next 2 weeks. I also recommended that he wear a wrist splint to provide increased support. I advised him to take ibuprofen 600 mg every 6 hours. Additionally, I recommended we obtain an EMG of the bilateral upper extremities to evaluate for carpal tunnel syndrome. The patient will follow up with me in 2 weeks when the EMG results are available for review. If at that time his symptoms have not improved with these conservative measures, we will discuss further treatment options including additional diagnostic testing or possible surgical intervention.

The patient states he understands and is in agreement with the plan. All questions were answered to the patient's satisfaction.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me in 2 weeks."
aci,ACI004,"[doctor]  Hi, Billy. How are you? What's been going on the medical assistant told me that you're having some difficulty urinating?
[patient]  Yeah, yeah, I didn't really want to come and talk about it's kind of weird, but I think probably over the last six months I'm just not peeing right it just doesn't seem to be normal
[doctor]  Okay, so let's talk a little bit about that now is your is your stream is your urination stream week?
[patient]  Yeah, I'd probably say so.
[doctor]  Okay, and do you feel like you're emptying your bladder fully? Or do you feel like you still have some urine left in there when you when you finish?
[patient]  Most of the times I'm okay, but sometimes if I stand there long enough, I can kind of go a little bit more. So it's taking a while actually to just go to the bathroom.
[doctor]  Okay, and are you waking up at night to go to the bathroom? Does it impact your sleep?
[patient]  Yeah, I try to empty my bladder now right before I go to bed and not drink anything, but I'm still probably getting up three or four times a night to go to the bed.
[doctor]  Okay, so you're getting up about three or four times a night and how long has this been going on you said for about six months?
[patient]  Yes, six months to like this and it's probably been a little bit worse over the last six months and maybe it's been longer I just didn't want to bring it up
[doctor]  Okay, so you think it's been going on longer? Okay. All right, now how about have you had any burning when you urinate at all?
[patient]  No, I don't think it burns.
[doctor]  No burning when you urinate okay and any other issues, any problems with your bowels, any constipation issues.
[patient]  No, I had diarrhea last week, but I think I ate something bad.
[doctor]  Okay, and ever have you ever had any issues where you had what we call urinary retention where you couldn't pee and you needed to have like a catheter inserted?
[patient]  My gosh, no.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  I'll do that.
[doctor]  All right, and have you ever seen a urologist I don't think so you've been my patient for a while I don't remember ever sending you, but have you ever seen one?
[patient]  I don't think so.
[doctor]  Okay, now tell me how are you doing with your heart when was the last time you saw Dr. Morthic cardiologist? I know that you had the stent placed in your right coronary artery about what was that 2018.
[patient]  Yes, sounds about right I think I just saw him in November. He said everything was okay.
[doctor]  He said everything was okay. All right. And so you haven't had any chest pain or shortness of breath. You're still walking around doing your activities of daily living. Are you exercising?
[patient]  kind of
[doctor]  Kind of okay now from what I remember I remember you being a big college football fan are you as excited as I and that Georgia beat Alabama in the national championships.
[patient]  He am super excited.
[doctor]  You don't really seem that excited.
[patient]  Get the problem fixed because I have to be able to sit there and watch the whole game.
[doctor]  Yeah, I really don't like Nick saving. I'm so I'm super happy that the dogs pulled it out.
[patient]  I don't know if we can do friends anymore.
[doctor]  Are you in Alabama fan?
[patient]  Maybe I'm actually originally not from Georgia so.
[doctor]  Okay alright while I'm in I am I'm a long horns fan. But anyway while I digress let's talk a little bit about your diet be these how are you doing with your sugars are you watching your diet.
[patient]  I'm trying to, yeah, I think they are okay.
[doctor]  Okay, and are you still taking the metformin?
[patient]  Yep.
[doctor]  You are okay. Alright now, I want to go ahead and just move on to a quick physical exam. Okay, I'm going to be calling out some of my exam findings and I'm going to let you know what that means when I'm done. Okay, alright, I do have to do a rectal exam. I apologize. I'm just going to be calling it out. What would I appreciate? Okay, so on your heart exam, I do appreciate a slight three out of six systolic ejection murmur hurt at the left base. On your lung, exam, your lungs are clear to osculation bilaterally on. Your abdominal exam, your abdomen is nontender and nondestended. I don't appreciate any masses or any rebound or guarding on your prostate exam. I do appreciate an enlarged prostate. I don't appreciate any masses on physical exam. So what, what does that mean? Billy? So that ultimately means that you know everything looks good. You know you have that little heart murmur, which I believe you've had in the past, but we're going to go ahead and look into that. You know your prostate seems a little bit enlarged to me on physical exam. So let's talk about how we can go about and remedy that. Okay, so for your first problem of this, you know, difficulty urinating, I want to go ahead and just order some routine labs. I want to get a PSA that kind of that ultimately kind of looks for prostate cancer issues, which I don't think you have because we didn't really appreciate that on physical exam. I want to go ahead and we can try to start you on what we call flow max 0.4 milligrams once a day. You should take it at night because it can cause people to get a little bit dizzy if they take it in the morning. So I would take it at night and I want to go ahead and refer you to a urologist just to look into this more. So we can go ahead and then get this problem solved for you. Okay, I'm also going to go ahead and just order some routine blood tests just to make sure that we are not missing anything. Do you have any questions about that? And I want to go ahead and order a urinalysis and a urine culture.
[patient]  Yeah, so sounds good have you seen that commercial for that super-batter-pros state stuff does that work?
[doctor]  Well, I think the data, it's it's I'm not really sure if it works or not I'm not that familiar with it. Let's just go ahead and stick with FlowMax and that's why we are going to refer you to the urologist so that they can go ahead and talk to you about you know the most current treatment options for you. Okay.
[patient]  All right.
[doctor]  All right, for your second problem of your coronary artery disease, I want to go ahead and order an echocardiogram just to follow up on that heart murmur that you had. And I want to go ahead and continue you on the lipitor 40 milligrams a day and the aspirin and the metaprolol. And I want to go ahead and order a lipid panel any questions about that.
[patient]  Nope.
[doctor]  Okay, and then for your third problem of your diabetes, it sounds like you're doing really. Well, let's go ahead and continue you on the metformin 1000 milligrams twice a day. We will go ahead and order a hemoglobin A1C to see if we need to make any adjustments to that. And I'm going to see you again in about three to four weeks. Okay, I want you to call me or message me in the patient portal if you have any concerns.
[patient]  Alright, when is the urologist gonna call me?
[doctor]  I'm going to reach out to them now and see if they can get you in this week.

aci,ACI016,"[doctor]  So, Anna, good to see you today. So, reading here in your appointment notes you were diagnosed with kidney stones from your PCP, and you currently have one. And so, they had you come in so can you tell me what happened? How's all that going for you?
[patient]  Shrubb been having some back pain on my right side. It's been lasting for about a week now.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  And I also started to see some blood in my urine.
[doctor]  Okay, so on the right side, so does that paint does it move anywhere? Or is it just kind of stay in that that one area?
[patient]  It's moved down a little bit onto my right lower side a little bit.
[doctor]  Side okay, so how would you describe the pain? Is it constant or does it come and go?
[patient]  It's pretty constant.
[doctor]  Okay, did you notice any pain when you're urinating? I know I know you say you saw you see blood, but any pain with that.
[patient]  No no real pain when I'm when I'm peeing at all.
[doctor]  Okay, so have you taken anything I know have you tried like Azo or any of that too?
[patient]  I took some ibuprofen that helped a little bit.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  but it still hurts even with ibuprofen.
[doctor]  All right, have you noticed any nausea vomiting fever chills?
[patient]  I haven't thrown up, but I fell a little bit nauseated.
[doctor]  Little nauseated. Yeah, that's we expected. So have you do you have a family history of kidney stones? I know some people when they have them like their parents have them stuff, but
[patient]  Yep, my dad had kidney stones, I think he has passed a couple of them. I'm not quite sure.
[doctor]  Alright, and have you had any in the past or is this your first one?
[patient]  This is my first time I've never had this before.
[doctor]  Okay, all right, so we'll do an exam on you just to check you out. So I guess you were in pain and stuff over the Easter Easter break there that.
[patient]  Yeah, yeah. I had some pain over the weekend. I saw my pediatrician this morning, so they sent me over here. They were concerned that I might have a kidney stone.
[doctor]  Okay, so I'm guessing you didn't get to go find the eggs on the Easter egg hunt because of the urine pain.
[patient]  Not so much, but I got to participate a little bit, I opened some eggs, I just didn't go run around and find them.
[doctor]  Okay, well I'm lucky enough my friends had an adult Easter hag hunt for me, and so I was able to find a couple eggs yesterday myself. So I'm glad you were able to get a few of them, alright, so let's do that that physical exam on you. So your vitals look good, you don't have any fever, your blood pressure, heart rate is fine, so when I press here on your belly does that hurt.
[patient]  A little bit, yeah.
[doctor]  A little bit, all right, so on your exam of your abdomen, there is mild pain and tenderness to palpation of the abdomen. There's no rebound or guarding there a CVA located near your flank tenderness on the right. So that means that everything looks good, but you do have what seems to be some inflammation of your kidney okay. So we were able to get a CT of your side, and it showed that you do have a stone measuring 0.5 centimeters in size, and it's located in the proximal right-your-reader. And so that's that duck that passes from your kidney to your bladder. All right, I don't see any evidence of hydronophrosis. So that means that there's not obstructing your reader causing swelling in your kidney, which is which is pretty good. So let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan so you do have that kidney stone on the right. So what I'm recommending is I want you to push fluids just to help facilitate you passing that stone all right, have you? Been taking in, have you been drinking enough water? Do you think so far?
[patient]  Probably not enough I drink some but.
[doctor]  Okay, yeah, I want you to drink, try, drink as much as possible just to see if we can get you hydrated and pass the stone what I'm going to do is I'm going to prescribe you ibuprofen 800 milligrams. You can take that as needed for pain. I know you said you were in that much pain. Just in case it does start to move your in pain, I want you to take the ibuprofen. I'm also going to give you a strainer for you to strain your pee so we can see. You want to know when that that stone does pass going to order. A BMP and a urinalysis and a urine culture and based on what the urinalysis shows we can decide. If I can decide, if I need to put you on antibiotics, if you do have an infection of some kind, and I want to see you back in about a week to two weeks, and if you're still having symptoms, we can discuss further treatment such as a lithotrypsy and it's a mainly minimally invasive procedure where we use shock waves to try to break up. That's stone, but otherwise do you have any other questions for me?
[patient]  know what i think so
[doctor]  Alright, so we will see you back in a week or two and I'll have my nurse come in with that prescription and hopefully with all the treatment you'll be able to pass the stone, okay? Alright.","HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Anna Diaz is a pleasant 29-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right-sided back pain.

For approximately 1 week, the patient has been experiencing constant right-sided back pain that radiates down to her lower right side, as well as hematuria and nausea. Her primary care physician was concerned for possible kidney stones and subsequently referred her here for further evaluation. She denies any pain with urination or vomiting, but admits that she has likely not been drinking enough water. The only treatment she has tried so far is ibuprofen with minimal pain relief. Although she denies any personal history of kidney stones prior to this occurrence, she explains that her father has had kidney stones in the past.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Constitutional: Negative for fever.
Gastrointestinal: Positive for nausea. Negative for vomiting.
Genitourinary: Positive for hematuria

VITALS

Vitals are normal.
Blood pressure is normal.
Heart rate is normal.

PHYSICAL EXAM

GI/GU: Mild pain and tenderness to palpation of the abdomen. No rebound or guarding. There is CVA located near her flank with tenderness on the right.

RESULTS

CT scan of the abdomen was reviewed today and revealed a kidney stone measuring 0.5 cm in size, located in the proximal right ureter. There is no evidence of hydronephrosis.

ASSESSMENT

Kidney stone, right side.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and CT results, I discussed the findings with the patient. The CT scan revealed a 0.5 cm kidney stone in the proximal right ureter. I advised her to drink plenty of fluids, as much as possible, to help facilitate passing of the stone. She was provided with a urine strainer so she can see if and when the stone passes. Given that over-the-counter ibuprofen is not providing significant relief, we will send in a prescription for ibuprofen 800 mg to help with her pain. I'm also going to order a BMP, urinalysis, and a urine culture for further evaluation. Depending on the results of the urinalysis, we may need to start her on antibiotics. I want to see her back in 2 weeks. If she is still symptomatic at that time, we may need to consider further treatment such as a lithotripsy. This procedure was explained to the patient.

INSTRUCTIONS

Follow up in 2 weeks."
aci,ACI020,"[doctor]  Hey Mason, good to see you today. So let's see you here in my notes for evaluation of kidney stones or your PCP. Said you had some kidney stones, so you got to referral over. So can you tell me a little bit about that, you know, what happened when did you first notice them?
[patient]  It was about, you know, about a week ago, and I was working down into the bar with the horses and, you know, I was moving some hay. But I developed this real sudden onset of pain in my right back. And I thought it initially, it was from throwing hay, but it I broke out into a sweat, I got real nauseated. And that's when I went and saw my doctor, and he ordered a CAT scan and said that I had a kidney stone, but you know that I've never had that. Before my father's had them in the past, but yes, so. That's how that all happened.
[doctor]  Okay, so you said you had the pain on the right hand side. Does it move anywhere or radiate?
[patient]  While when I had it it would it radiated almost down to my groin.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  not the whole way down, but almost to the groin, and since then I haven't had any more pain, and it just been right about there.
[doctor]  Okay, and is the pain constant or does it come and go?
[patient]  Well, when I, you know, after I found out I had a disk of kidney stone, it came a couple times, but it didn't last as long no. I've been straining my urine. They told me to pee in this little cup.
[doctor]  Hmm.
[patient]  And I've been straining my urine and you know I don't see anything in there.
[doctor]  Okay, have you noticed any blood in your urine? I know you've been draining, probably take a good look at it has it been darker than usual.
[patient]  No, not really not really darker.
[doctor]  Okay, so have you had kidney stones before and then you said your father had them, but...
[patient]  I've never had a kidney stone my dad had them a lot, but I've never had one.
[doctor]  Okay, all right, so let me do a quick exam of you. Your vital signs look good. I don't see any fever or your blood pressure and heart rate are fine. So let me do a quick physical exam. Let me press here on your belly. So on your examination of your abdomen, there is no tenderness to depain to palpation of the abdomen. There is no rebound or guarding there as CVA. There is tenderness on the right side. So that means
[patient]  I have a stroke.
[doctor]  Can you repeat that?
[patient]  How did I have a stroke?
[doctor]  No, no, no, no, no. So that means like everything is normal, right? But I feel like you have some tenderness and inflammation over your kidney. So that has to be expected because you do have a kidney stone. So I did review the results of your CT. And it does show a stone that's measuring 0.5 centimeters located in the proximal right your reader. And that's that duct that classes from your kidney to down to your bladder. There is no evidence of hydronophrosis that would mean that the stone is obstruct obstructing the your reader causing swelling in the kidney. So there is there is no evidence of that. So let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan. So you do have that kidney stone. So right now I'm going to recommend that we have you push fluids just to help facilitate you urinating and passing the stone. I'm going to prescribe you some oxycodone 5 milligrams every six to eight hours for pain. And you can continue to take Tylenol between that for any breakthrough pain. And you already have a strainer. So that's good. Continue to use that. And we can see continue that until the stone passes. And I'm also going to order a BMP and your urinalysis and urine culture just to make sure that everything else is okay with you. And based on your analysis we can see if we need to prescribe you antibiotics. See if you have any type of infection. I do want to see you back in about one to two weeks. And hopefully by that time you pass the stone. But if not we can discuss further treatment. Lithotrypsy it's like a shock wave kind of breaks up that stone. It's not it's not that invasive procedure. But we can just we can discuss that if it hasn't passed in that one to two weeks that sound good.
[patient]  That sounds perfect dear to.
[doctor]  Alright.
[patient]  Thank you, document.
[doctor]  So I will see you in a week or so and hopefully you've passed that stone and I'll send my nurse in with that prescription.
[patient]  Okay, thank you.

We reviewed the patient's CT results in detail today. I have recommended that we treat the patient conservatively. I have prescribed the patient oxycodone 5 mg every 6 to 8 hours for pain. He may continue to take Tylenol between the oxycodone doses for any breakthrough pain. The patient should continue to use the strainer when he urinates until the stone passes. I have also recommended that we obtain a BMP, urinalysis, and urine culture to evaluate for any signs of infection.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me in 1 to 2 weeks to check on his progress. If his symptoms have not improved, we will discuss further treatment options including lithotripsy."
aci,ACI025,"[doctor]  So Sophia, I see that you hurt your knee tell me about what happened.
[patient]  Yeah, I was jumping on my kid trampoline and I could just slip out from under me.
[doctor]  My gosh, one of those big trampolines in your backyard.
[patient]  Yeah, pretty big one.
[doctor]  Okay, which knee was it?
[patient]  My right knee.
[doctor]  Right knee okay and when did this happen?
[patient]  about four days ago.
[doctor]  Great the weather was perfect this weekend. So I'm glad you at least got outside. Sorry to hear you got hurt. Okay, so you're right. Needed you, did you feel it like pop or snap or anything when you heard it?
[patient]  Yeah, I fell a little pop and then it swelled up really big afterward.
[doctor]  Okay, did you try anything for the pain?
[patient]  I took some ibuprofen and I put some ice on it.
[doctor]  Okay did that help.
[patient]  a little bit, but it's still really hard to get around.
[doctor]  All right, and have you been able to stand on it or does that hurt too much?
[patient]  It hurts quite a bit to stand, but I'm able to put weight on it.
[doctor]  Okay, all right. And what part of the knee is it inside outside middle?
[patient]  kind of that inside part of my kneecap.
[doctor]  Okay, all right. And okay, so as long as you're here and then your primary care physician, I'm looking through your chart and it looks like we're treating your diabetes. So how you've been doing with your diet overall are you keeping your sugars low?
[patient]  It's going okay. I forget to check quite a bit though.
[doctor]  Sure.
[patient]  on it.
[doctor]  Yeah, I understand. How has your diet been lately?
[patient]  It's been pretty good.
[doctor]  Okay, okay good good you know it's hard to stay away from the sugary foods. Sometimes I I enjoy ice cream regularly. Okay, so let's do physical exam as long as you are here. So I'm just going to listen to your heart, your heart sounds normal no murmurs or gallops listen to your lungs quick. If you can take a deep breath lungs or clear that's good news, let's take a look at that knee right knee looks like it definitely has some swelling. I'm going to do some maneuvers. Here does it hurt when I push you on the inside of the knee.
[patient]  Yeah, that hurts.
[doctor]  Okay, how about the outside?
[patient]  A little bit, but not as much.
[doctor]  Okay, so some pain on palpation on the inside, a little bit of pain on the outside of the knee. If I bend the knee back, does that hurt?
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  How about when I extend it?
[patient]  Yeah, that hurts.
[doctor]  Okay, so a little bit of limited range of motion, as well as pain on both flexion and extension on the knee. I'm going to push on this a little bit. Looks like your McMurray's test is negative, just checking for a meniscus tear. Okay, so let's talk a little bit about your plan. What I am concerned about for your knee is it sounds like you have a torn or injured MCLI. It's that inside tendon in your knee. So I'm concerned about that since you're having trouble with weight bearing and you heard that pop. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to put you in a straight leg brace and I'll prescribe some mowbic. You can start taking that as a pain reliever and to try to get some of the swelling down. I want you to ice your knee once an hour for about 15 minutes, but I'm also going to send you out for a MRI because we want to make sure this is what happens if there's any other damage to the knee. Does that sound good?
[patient]  Yeah, that sounds great. Thank you.
[doctor]  Yeah, and then for your diabetes, as long as you're here, it sounds like you're managing that pretty well. But I do want to get a recheck on your hemoglobin A1c. And then I'm also going to get a refill on the metformin that you have been taking 500 milligrams, so you can keep taking that as well. So, do you have any other questions for me?
[patient]  No, that's a thanks.
[doctor]  Alright, well, thank you. Hope that you feel better.","CHIEF COMPLAINT

aci,ACI027,"[doctor]  Hey Gabriel and Dr. Scott good to see you today. I know you've heard about Dax's it okay if I tell Dax a little bit about you.
[patient]  Sure.
[doctor]  Okay, so Gabriel is a 43-year-old male today here for back pain evaluation and also has a past medical history of diabetes, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol. So Gabriel tell me what's going on with your back.
[patient]  while I was working the yard and you know been over to pick something up and I got this pain and you know across the lower part of my back and then it went down my left leg and you know it's been going on for about four days and just doesn't seem to be getting any better.
[doctor]  Ok, are you a big gardener or this is something that you just started working in the yard?
[patient]  Yeah, I know my wife held a gun to my head. Make me go out there working a yard and carry some stuff around. It's not my not my first choice, but...
[doctor]  Sure sure.
[patient]  But that day, I lost the, I lost the argument.
[doctor]  Yeah, yeah, that happens to all of this. So when this back pain happened, so it was basically you were lifting, you were bending down to lift something up, and you had the sharp pain going down your right, like you said.
[patient]  Left leg.
[doctor]  Left leg, okay got it sorry and any weakness or numbness in your legs or just the pain mostly.
[patient]  In certain positions I get some tingling, but no mostly just pain.
[doctor]  Okay, and any loss of bowel or bladder function at all or anything like that.
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Okay, and have you had any back surgeries or back problems in the past or this is kind of the first time?
[patient]  No surgeries you know I've had back pain occasionally over the years.
[doctor]  Okay, have you had any, any, any, have you tried anything for pain for this? Have you tried any, any medications at all?
[patient]  I've had ibuprofenated help sum.
[doctor]  Okay, got it all right. Well, I'll examine you in a second. But before we do that, let's talk about some of the other conditions that we're kind of following you from looking at your problem list now. And you've got a history of diabetes, and you're on Metformin 500 milligram twice a day. And you're how are you doing with your blood sugars and your, and your diet and exercise?
[patient]  Yeah, I check my sugar 2 or 3 times a week most of the time, it's in that 120 to 140 range.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  Yeah, I take my medicine, okay, my diet is alright, you know, I could be 15 pounds lighter, that would be alright, but
[doctor]  Sure.
[patient]  I think the sugar has been okay.
[doctor]  Okay, we checked your hemoglobin, a1c last time I'm looking at your records and epic, and it showed that it was you know 7. One so it's it's good, but it could be better any, you know, we talked about it controlling your diet or improving your diet and trying to have a balanced meal and not eating some of these sweets and high sugar items. How is that going? I know you had talked about your wife being a great cook and making cookies and that's hard to stay away from obviously how things going with that.
[patient]  Yes, she still makes cookies and I still eat them, but you know we're trying to try to do better, try and stay away from more of those carbs and focus on, you know, less cardio, less sweet stuff.
[doctor]  Okay, all right, yeah, that's always a struggle. I certainly understand, but you know, really important with your diabetes, just to prevent some of the complications like kidney failure and eye problems, and just keep your sugar under balance. So I'll order another hemoglobin A1c today. We'll check that again today. And, you know, just re-emphasizing the controlling your diet and exercise is super important. And then we'll have those. Results back will see if we need to make any modifications, okay.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  For your high blood pressure, your blood pressure, and the clinic looks pretty good, it's about 120 over 70. Right now we have you on Norvask 5 milligrams, once a day how are things going with that? Are you checking that periodically or any issues with that at all?
[patient]  Yeah, I guess I check it maybe once a week or two or three times a month. And at the vast majority of the time, when I check it, it's good. Usually either that 120 to 130 over 70 to 80 range, I think the blood pressure is okay.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  I haven't had any real problems there. I have had some some swelling in my ankles though.
[doctor]  Okay, is that new war? Is that been going on for a while?
[patient]  Well it started maybe I don't know a month or two after I started the Norvask.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  and I was just wondering if the two might be related.
[doctor]  Yeah, I mean, certainly it could be it is, you know, sometimes that medication can cause that so I'll examine you in a second and see if we need to make any modifications okay.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Alright, so, and you're anything else bothering you today.
[patient]  No, I'm doing okay, I think.
[doctor]  So let me examine you for a second. I'm going to go ahead and Gabriel. I'm going to do my magic exam. Now let's pretend I am just going to verbalize some of my findings as I do my exam. And so.
[patient]  These are like my video visit exams.
[doctor]  Exactly, so your neck exam has no JVD. There is no roots that I can hear your lung exam, no rals, no wheezing on your heart exam. You do have a 2 over 6 systolic ejection murmur you had that in the past. So I'm not too worried about that otherwise regular rate and rhythm on your heart exam on your on your belly exam is nice and soft on your back exam. You do have some tenderness on the left paris spinal area, right where I'm pressing right there your straight leg raise test is negative your reflexes are normal. You have some just some tenderness in the lower back in the paris spinal area of your back. When I palpate there otherwise your neurological exam is normal on your extremity exam. You do have this one plus non-pitting edema of your lower extremities, which is a little bit of swelling in your ankles no calf tenderness negative home in sign, no signs of blood. Clot, that's what that means. So let me just review what you know explain what all this means. So the back pain the first problem that you're here today for I think this is more of a muscular sprain I'm going to recommend we start you on some anti-inflammatory napperson 500, 500 milligrams twice a day and flexural 10 milligrams twice a day as well. I'm going to refer you to for for physical therapy to help strengthen some of the muscles in your lower back. I don't think you need an x-ray at this stage. Why do we start with physical therapy and the muscle relaxers and the pain medicines if it doesn't get better then we can get an x-ray but right now I would start with that if that's okay with any questions about that.
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Okay, for the diabetes, the second problem that we talked about today, I'm going to order another hemoglobin, A1c, continue the metformin 500 milligrams twice a day. Why don't we have you come back in about two weeks, and we should have some of the results back, and we can discuss if we need to make any modifications for that, but right now we will continue the course, and we will go from there okay, for the high blood pressure. You do have this 1 plus edema in your legs, I'm going to go ahead and order some blood work today, I'm going to go ahead and stop the norvask, and we'll put you on some hydrochlorothiazide 10 milligrams once a day. And if that doesn't get if the swelling doesn't go away, I'm going to do some more testing for right now. Let's get some sort off with some CBC, and a BMP, I'm going to check your kidney function, I'm going to get another EKG, and also I'm going to get a chest X-ray, and we'll go from there, but hopefully, this will go away once we stop this medication since it started around. That time okay, okay, and I think that's it, anything else we forgot about, do you need refills for anything?
[patient]  No, I think I'm okay. You gave me a year's worth of refills last time we were together.
[doctor]  Okay sounds great alright thanks Gabriel Good seeing you again.
[patient]  Good to see you, thanks.","CHIEF COMPLAINT

[patient]  I don't hear the question, but I'm assuming that you and you say, BATCHER. So when I start talking about my dog and my three cats, and all that those sort of things are not going to be included in the note.
[doctor]  Right, I want you, you can talk about those things, yes.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Okay, so with your newly diagnosed ovarian cancer, so how are you feeling today? How are you doing?
[patient]  I'm doing pretty good to press.
[doctor]  Little depressed, I can understand it's a lot to take on, isn't it?
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  Okay, okay, so let me ask you some questions. So what kind of symptoms were you having that prompted your doctor to do the tests?
[patient]  I was having severe pain and bleeding.
[doctor]  Okay, now do you have other symptoms such as weight loss constipation vomiting or issues with your nation?
[patient]  no vomiting but constipation and weight loss.
[doctor]  Okay, yeah, that's understandable. So do you have any children or have you ever been pregnant?
[patient]  I'm sorry I didn't hear that part.
[doctor]  Do you have any children or have you ever been pregnant?
[patient]  Note it either one of those.
[doctor]  Okay, so, and do you know at what age you got your period and when you started menopause?
[patient]  13 from my period in 28th from Menopause.
[doctor]  Okay, do you take any oral hormone replacement therapy?
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Okay, any history of endometriosis?
[patient]  Any history of what?
[doctor]  endometriosis.
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Okay, how about any family history of any gynecological cancers?
[patient]  I was adopted.
[doctor]  Okay, okay. So I'm just going to do a quick exam of your abdomen and then perform a vaginal exam, okay.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Alright, okay, so I do feel the mass on the where to go here, okay.
[patient]  I didn't know you were going to play a doctor today.
[doctor]  I did okay, okay, so I do feel the mass on the left side, but everything else looks good. And on abdominal exam, there is slight tenderness to palpation of the left lower quadrant, no rebounding, or guarding on vaginal exam. There are no external lesions on the labia, the vaginal vault, is within normal limits the cervix is pink without lesions. And on bimanural exam, I appreciate a left adnexal mass. And there is no masses. On the right, okay, so now I reviewed the results of your abdominal CT, which show a. Three centimeter left ovarian mass with an associated local localized lymph node involvement, there is no evidence of gross peritoneal or metastatic disease. So let me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan. So for the first problem, so I do think this is most likely a variant cancer looking at your CT scan. It looks like stage three a disease based on the lymph node involvement. I want to start by sending off some blood tests like a CA 125 and HCG and AFP and LDH, these are just tests that help me to determine what type of tumor I'm dealing with. And then I want you to undergo genetic counseling and testing to see if you have a genetic predisposition for developing ovarian cancer. So this stage of ovarian cancer is treated by performing surgery followed by adjunct chemotherapy. So this means we'll start chemotherapy after you've recovered from surgery. Okay, so for the surgery, I would perform a hysterectomy remove both ovaries and perform a lymph node dissection to remove the involved and involve lymph nodes as well as any other ones I see. And I'll also send a sample of any tissue if there anything that looks suspicious at all. And we'll be able to tell exactly what stage this is based on the pathology reports I then recommend chemotherapy with cisplatin and taxol. And based on how the surgery goes, I may want you to receive intreparentenial intreparentenial chemo, which is done inserting a small tube into. You're belly for the chemo to go directly into your peritoneum. Now I know. That was a lot sick and you have any questions or...
[patient]  Am I gonna die?
[doctor]  Well, that's a good question. So based on what I see at this time, I will we believe you have a favorable diagnosis prognosis, and you're also still young and healthy, which makes your prognosis even better. And we do need to see a final pathology report to give you a definitive answer, though, okay?
[patient]  Alright, alright.","CHIEF COMPLAINT

FAMILY HISTORY

The patient was adopted and has no knowledge of any family history.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Constitutional: Reports unintentional weight loss
Gastrointestinal: Reports abdominal pain and constipation. Denies vomiting.
Genitourinary: Reports abnormal vaginal bleeding. Denies urinary issues.
Psychiatric: Reports depression

PHYSICAL EXAM

Gastrointestinal
- Examination of Abdomen: There is slight tenderness to palpation of the left lower quadrant. No rebounding or guarding.

Pelvic
- Examination: There are no external lesions on the labia. The vaginal vault is within normal limits. The cervix is pink without lesions. On bimanual exam, I appreciate a left adnexal mass. No masses on the right.

RESULTS

CT scan of the abdomen was reviewed and demonstrated a 3 cm left ovarian mass with associated localized lymph node involvement. There is no evidence of gross peritoneal or metastatic disease.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Ovarian cancer.
- Medical Reasoning: Looking at her abdominal CT results, it appears to be stage IIIA disease based on the lymph node involvement.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I explained to the patient that the typical approach to treating this stage of cancer is surgical intervention followed by adjunct chemotherapy. The procedure and subsequent chemotherapy plans were discussed in detail. Given that she is young and otherwise healthy, I reassured her that I believe her prognosis is favorable based on her current status, however, this is dependent on the final pathology report. All of her questions were answered.
- Medical Treatment: I want to start by ordering several blood tests including a CA-125, hCG, AFP, and LDH. I also want her to undergo genetic counseling and testing to see if she has a genetic predisposition for developing ovarian cancer. I recommend we perform a hysterectomy and oophorectomy, as well as a lymph node dissection to remove any involved lymph nodes. Any concerning tissue will be biopsied and sent to pathology for staging. After she has recovered from surgery, she will start chemotherapy treatment with cisplatin and Taxol. We may also consider intraperitoneal chemotherapy.

[patient]  Well, I had surgery on my right knee before.
[doctor]  Okay, so you've had surgery before. All right, do you remember what kind of surgery?
[patient]  I don't know they told me they reconstructed the whole thing I was 14. I was a really good gymnast back then really good.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  and I was doing a back summer saw and I felt a pop thin and then since that time I've really had problems with my knee.
[doctor]  AH!
[patient]  But you know the athlete that I am, I can still really ski very well. So I just kept going.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  And I'm really tough, my pain tolerance is very high.
[doctor]  Okay, okay, okay, how so? Do you have any other exercises that I might want to know about outside of intense gym and ski events?
[patient]  No, I think that's about it.
[doctor]  Okay, and how frequently do you normally ski?

[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Alright, so pain on dorsiflexion, but not on plantar flexion, plantar flexion, okay? Alright, so what we are going to do right now, I think I'm going to look at your X-rays, but when I look at the results of your X-ray, I do not appreciate any fracture. What I am noticing is the development of a little bit of arthritis, and that could explain why you say that your joints hurt a bit more during windy weather, and what not so this. Is what we're going to do for my assessment and plan right the first? Thing is, I think you have a strain of your posterior cruciate ligament. What that means is what that will mean for you, though. Is that we are going to continue to brace your right knee that's going to hopefully take off some of the stress that you might be putting on it especially since your linting, I am going to recommend you for physical therapy. I think it would be, and I think it's a good idea to maybe start three times a week to get your strength back into. Your knee, I would recommend not skiing or doing any gymnastics for now, and I think that physical therapy will really help considering the injury that you had when you were 14. I'm going to prescribe you some medications. I don't necessarily recommend consuming gummies at the same time, but the medications I'm going to give you are going to be Miloxicam 15 milligrams. You're going to take that once a day that will help with the swelling and the bruising. I'm also going to prescribe you just like a higher strength N said. So I be profanate. 100 milligrams a day, you can take that twice a day as needed for your left knee. I think you are, I think you just kind of like strength a little bit, but like not enough to necessarily require any kind of like medication or bracing. I think you just take it easy on your body. I know that you're like very active from what I hear, and I think that that's really exciting, but I think you might need to listen to your body and give yourself a bit of a break. You'll be able to do like several workouts when you go to when you go to physical therapy, but you know, let the yell at your therapist be your guide about like what you should and should not be putting your body through does that make sense.
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  Alright, do you have any questions right now?
[patient]  No thank you so much.
[doctor]  No problem.","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Right knee injury.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Elizabeth Ross is a pleasant 91-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of a right knee injury. The onset of her pain began 2 weeks ago, when she was downhill skiing. She states she ran into a tree and twisted her right knee. At the time of the injury, she also heard a pop in her left knee, however she denies left knee pain. The patient locates her pain to the medial aspect of her right knee. Currently, her pain level is 7 out of 10, however she notes this can reach an 11 out of 10 at times with prolonged ambulation. The patient states that her pain has been slowly increasing over the last few days. She experiences limping with ambulation. The patient states that her pain lasts for as long as she is ambulating. She denies radiating pain. She also reports constant swelling and stiffness in the morning. Her stiffness will resolve with ambulation. The patient has been wearing a brace and using THC cream, which has been helpful. She denies taking any medications for pain, however she has been utilizing THC gummies, which have been beneficial.

The patient has a history of a right knee reconstruction when she was 14 years old. She states that she was a good gymnast at that time. The patient adds that she has had problems with her right knee since that time. She denies any other exercises outside of intense gym and ski events. The patient states that she normally skis 3 times per week.

SURGICAL HISTORY

The patient reports a history of total right knee reconstruction at the age of 14.

MEDICATIONS

She denies needing medications.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports right knee pain, swelling, and stiffness. Denies left knee pain.

PHYSICAL EXAM

MSK: Examination of the right knee: Mild effusion. The patient ambulated with an antalgic gait. Pain with dorsiflexion, but not with plantarflexion.

RESULTS

4 views of the right knee were taken. These reveal no evidence of any fractures. There is development of mild arthritis.

ASSESSMENT

1. Right knee posterior cruciate ligament strain.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regard to her current symptoms. I have explained to her that her x-rays did not reveal any signs of a fracture. I have recommended that we treat the patient conservatively with continued bracing. We will initiate formal physical therapy 3 times per week to strengthen her right knee. Additionally, I have prescribed the patient meloxicam 15 mg and ibuprofen 800 mg twice daily as needed. She should discontinue the use of her THC gummies while taking these medications.

Regarding her left knee, I do not believe she will need any further medications to treat this. I have advised her to avoid skiing or gymnastics at this time.

aci,ACI032,"[patient]  Alright, thanks for coming in today. I see on my chart here that you had a bunch of lower respiratory infections. So first tell me how are you what's going on.
[doctor]  You know I'm doing better now, but you know last week I was really sick and I just have had enough like I was coughing a lot, a lot of mucus even had some shortness of breath and even a low grade fever.
[patient]  Wow, that is a lot. So what did you do for some of those symptoms?
[doctor]  You know I ended up drinking a lot of fluid and taking some robotusin and I actually got better over the weekend. And now I'm feeling much better but what concerns me is that I tend to get pneumonia a lot.
[patient]  Okay, so when you say a lot like how frequently does it occur, I would say it seems honestly, it seems like it's every month or every other month, especially over the past six, six months that I just keep getting sick and I usually will end up having to go to my primary care doctor or...
[doctor]  urgent care, and I'll get prescribed some antibiotics, and one time I actually ended up in the emergency room.
[patient]  Wow, and how long do your symptoms normally last for?
[doctor]  You know it could be as few as like a couple of days, but sometimes it could go even up to a week.
[patient]  In Memhem, you mentioned that you were a farmer. Did you notice that your symptoms occur while doing certain things on the farm?
[doctor]  You know I was trying to think about that and I've been working on the farm for some time. But the only thing I can think about is that I've been helping my brother out and I've been started like unloading a lot of hay which I don't usually do and I want to say that my symptoms actually start the days that I'm unloading hay.
[patient]  Alright, do you wear a mask when you're unloading hay?
[doctor]  No, I don't do that.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  None of us do.
[patient]  Okay, yeah. So like that your brother doesn't either.
[doctor]  No, I'm the only one who seems to be getting sick.
[patient]  Alright, so I know you said you were trying to like help out your brother like what's going on with him.
[doctor]  You know, we've just been getting really busy and so he has been working around doing other things, so I've just been helping him just cover the extra load.
[patient]  m-okay alright do you have any other siblings
[doctor]  Yeah, there is actually ten of us.
[patient]  Wow, okay, that's a lot of siblings.
[doctor]  Yeah, I'm okay.
[patient]  Maybe we could always stick them and they could get some work down the holidays must be fun at your place.
[doctor]  Yeah, we don't need to hire anyone else to have anyone else this is our family.
[patient]  You're right, keep in the family. Okay. So speaking of family, do you have, do you, or anyone have a history of seasonal allergies?
[doctor]  No, no, I have never had any problems with allergies.
[patient]  Okay, and you smoke.
[doctor]  I don't smoke.
[patient]  Do you live with anybody who does?
[doctor]  I do not.
[patient]  Okay, all right, so okay. So now I want to go ahead and do my physical exam. I'm going to call out some of my findings just to make sure that I'm documenting everything. And if you have any questions about what it is that I'm saying, please feel free to ask, okay?
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  So I reviewed your vitals and you appear to be breathing a little faster respiratory rate is 20, but your oxygen is your satin kind of fine at 99% on room air. So I'm not too worried about that on for on your heart exam. I do you have a regular rate and regular rhythm. I do not appreciate any murmurs, rubs or gallops on your lung exam. You know, I do you do have some fine rals on your lung exam, but no, weasers and on your musculoskeletal exam, I do not appreciate any clubbing of your fingers. So for your results, I did review the results of your chest x-ray and I noticed some round glass opacities. So let me tell you a little bit about like my assessment and plan for your first problem of recurrent lung infections, your symptoms seem consistent with the condition we call hypersensitivity numinitis in your case. Another name is farmers lung, which you know is appropriate considering your job. This could be caused by bacteria and or mold that is found in the when you inhale it leads to an allergic reaction in your lungs. This is why your symptoms occur every time you move hay for your current symptoms, I'm going to prescribe you a a course of an oral steroid. This will help to decrease the inflammation that is occurring in your lungs. I will also be ordering a cat scan in your lungs, which will help confirm the diagnosis as well. Opulmonary function test to assess how severe your respiratory impairment is it would be best if you could eliminate your exposure to the hay or prevent further to prevent further damage to your lungs, however, if you are unable, it's very important that you wear a respirator when moving hay around. I know that that was a lot of information. I think it boils down to pull in more of your siblings to help work around, but do you have any questions?
[doctor]  Yes, so is this gonna help so I don't keep getting sick.
[patient]  So ideally what we are doing, I think this is the best course of action to deal with a deeper problem right of these infections. And to kind of like clear up the pneumonia, everything seems to hint on. So what we're going to do is treat your current infection. We're going to either prevent you from being around hay or make it so that it's safe for you to be with hay. And then we're going to see what we need to do moving forward does that help.
[doctor]  Okay, it does.
[patient]  All right.
[doctor]  Thank you.
[patient]  Okay, no problem.
[doctor]  Alright.","CHIEF COMPLAINT

aci,ACI035,"[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  Good morning.
[doctor]  Good morning, thanks, Dr. Dr. Cooper. I'm, I'm, you know, I'm a little, I'm sad to be in here, but you know, thanks for taking me and I appreciate it.
[patient]  Sure, absolutely, what can I help you with today?
[doctor]  So you know I've been dealing with my asthma and like I tried to join sports but it's really kind of it's getting hard you know and I I just wonder if there's something that can be done because I really do like playing water polo.
[patient]  But I'm having difficulty breathing. Sometimes I've had to like you know, stop matches and sit on the side. Just to kind of like catch my breath and use my inhaler. So I was wondering if there was something we could do about it.
[doctor]  And then I'm kind of a little bit worried, I think my mood is getting a little, a little worrisome, and I wanted to explore what my options were.
[patient]  Okay, let's talk about the asthma first. So what inhaler are you using now?
[doctor]  I have an Albuterol inhaler.
[patient]  Okay, and when you're having trouble, it's usually just around sports that is keeping you up at night.
[doctor]  So I don't really like wake up at night, a lot typically like it sports like, you know, if I'm doing anything like crazy aerobic or like running or anything I do notice that if any if I'm around smoke, I do start coughing a little bit, but most of the time it sports.
[patient]  Okay, and can you describe a little bit from me what happens?
[doctor]  I start to yanno so I start to feel like there is like some flim building up in my throat and I start coughing like my chest gets tight I start wheezing and I just have to sit down or else I'm going to get like lightheaded too.
[patient]  Okay, and then when you use your inhaler.
[doctor]  Hmm.
[patient]  Does it alleviate the problem?
[doctor]  So yet helps with that like flim feeling, you know, but I still have to sit down, you know, and like breathe. And then the thing that I hate about that inhaler is I start getting like shaky is that supposed to be happening.
[patient]  Yes, that is unfortunately normal and a side effect with the inhaler.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  So you use your using two Puffs to the inhaler.
[doctor]  Hmm.
[patient]  for the symptoms.
[doctor]  Yes.
[patient]  And then you sit down and does it, does it get better within about 15 minutes or so?
[doctor]  Yeah, yeah, it does, but you know, I had to like step out of the pool to make that happen. I'm hoping that there is something else we can do. Okay. Have you ever taken any daily medications for your asthma, an inhaler, or a singular, or anything like that? No, I just use my inhaler whenever I have an attack.
[patient]  Okay, so that's something we might want to consider, but how often is it happening?
[doctor]  Pretty much every time I do any kind of aerobic workout.
[patient]  Okay, and outside of physical activity, you're not having any problems.
[doctor]  Yeah, there's that part where like, if I'm around somebody who's been smoking a lot or is currently smoking, but I usually just step away. I don't even like to be around them, you know, that makes sense.
[patient]  Alright, we will look at that tell me about the mood issues you're having.
[doctor]  Yeah, so one of the reasons I got into like trying to get into sports is like I feel like you know you feel a lot more energized and a lot you know happier, but like lately I've just been kind of stressed out you know like I have I have like sets that I need to study for I've got like all these AP classes you know there's just I feel like there's a lot of pressure and you know like I get it but there are times where I'm just like really down and I don't really know what else I can do.
[patient]  Okay, that makes sense. Any any difficulty with focusing or you're having difficulty retaining information or is it more feeling sad not having motivation?
[doctor]  So I think it's like a lot of sadness, a lot of like you know I don't really I kind of feel like you know I don't really like want to do anything you know my friends will go out and I'll just be like I'd rather be at home. I am really tired a lot too.
[patient]  Okay, all right, well let me let me go ahead and check you out.
[doctor]  Hmm.
[patient]  And then we can talk a little bit more.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  I'm going to take a listen to your heart and lungs.
[doctor]  Hmm.
[patient]  and everything sounds good.
[doctor]  Let me take a look at your eyes.
[patient]  And in your ears, everything looks okay. Have you had any problems with allergies? You have seasonal allergies or anything like that.
[doctor]  Yeah, I think so, yeah.
[patient]  I do see just a little bit of fluid in the ears.
[doctor]  Hmm.
[patient]  I'm gonna look in your mouth too.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  and throat looks fine no tonsils.
[doctor]  Hmm.
[patient]  Let me go ahead and have you lay back on the table and I'll take a listen to your stomach.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  Everything sounds okay. I'm going to feel around just to make sure everything feels normal.
[doctor]  Hmm.
[patient]  Everything feels fine and I'm going to check reflexes and they're all normal.
[doctor]  Awesome!
[patient]  It's really hard to do with actual patient. So in terms of the asthma, I think we could try a daily medication since it looks like you might be having a little bit of allergies, maybe we can try some singular.
[doctor]  Hmm.
[patient]  And start with that once you are on that daily, and you can continue to use the Albuterol inhaler those side effects, unfortunately you're right. It's just one of the expected side effects with an Albuterol inhaler. I would recommend just what you're doing to sit down for a little bit after you take it.
[doctor]  And we will get you started on the singular probably within about a month you should see a difference. So I will have you come back in about six weeks and follow up and see how you're doing with that.
[patient]  In terms of the mood, is this new for you?
[doctor]  Yeah, I think so like when I started this year.
[patient]  And it sounds like related to school expectations and the stress with saps and all of that.
[doctor]  Yeah
[patient]  Okay, let's consider having you start seeing a therapist. I think that would be a good place to start.
[doctor]  Hmm.
[patient]  and we will do some screening questionnaires and then follow up in a couple weeks on that too.
[doctor]  Okay, all right, sounds like a plan, okay.
[patient]  Thank you.","CHIEF COMPLAINT

aci,ACI037,"[doctor]  Carolyn is a 34-year-old female with a history of diabetes melatist type 2, who is here today with a headache. So, hi there, Carolyn. It's nice to see you again. Listen, I'm sorry you're having headaches. Well, let's talk about it, but I would like to record this conversation with this app that's going to help me focus on you more wood that be okay with you.
[patient]  Yes, that's okay.
[doctor]  Okay, great. Thanks so Carolyn. Tell me about your headache and headache or headaches when did when did they start and and what symptoms are you having?
[patient]  My headache started about a week ago. It's feeling like a dull pain in the back of my head. I have flushing in my ears, they get really red and hot. And sometimes I just feel a little bit dizzy when I get these headaches. But I've taken Tylenol and Advil, and it's not really going away. It just keeps coming back.
[doctor]  Okay, and all right, and so this started about a week ago, has it been fairly constant since it started or does it come and go does it come and go or what?
[patient]  It comes and goes out to relieve when I take my Tylenol or Advil, but then it comes right back.
[doctor]  Okay, and do you notice any any timing difference you know is it is it worse in the morning worse in the evening? Is there anything else that makes it better or worse?
[patient]  It's definitely worse in the evening.
[doctor]  Okay, and do you feel any sort of tightness in the back of your neck or in your shoulders or you know you said it's in the back of your head primarily, any discomfort anywhere else?
[patient]  Yes, no, just in the back of my head.
[doctor]  Okay, and did the headache start all of a sudden carol in, or has it been gradual or what?
[patient]  I've been under a lot of stress lately, so maybe about when some stress started occurring.
[doctor]  Okay, okay. And all right. And have you noticed any fever along with the headache?
[patient]  No no fever.
[doctor]  Okay, and any visual changes, you know, wavy lines in your vision spots in your vision, or anything like that.
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Okay, and have you had headaches like this before?
[patient]  I have.
[doctor]  Okay, so this isn't the worst headache you've ever had, what did you say?
[patient]  No, it's not.
[doctor]  Okay, all right, and so okay fair enough now how's your diabetes been been been doing lately? Have you what have your blood sugars been running in the low 100s or 200s or what?
[patient]  I haven't been checking my blood sugars.
[doctor]  Really okay, well we will get you back on that. And we can talk about that, but how about your metformin? Are you still taking the 500 milligrams once a day? No actually, it looks like we increased your metformin to 500 milligrams twice a day last visit. Are you still taking that?
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  Okay, great. And okay, you're still watching your diet and getting some exercise.
[patient]  I have not been eating well because I've been stressed over the last week, but I haven't been exercising for maybe the past week, but generally I've been doing better.
[doctor]  Okay, the headache has this maybe made you feel uncomfortable and prevented your exercise. Would you say or what?
[patient]  Yes it has.
[doctor]  Okay, okay, so you probably haven't been out golfing. I remember you're a big golfer. So not not lately. So you know being
[patient]  Not lately.
[doctor]  Being down, being down here in Florida, we got Tuggett get some golf fins. So, hey, did you see the masters, by the way, a few weeks ago, wasn't that I don't know, did you happen to catch it?
[patient]  I did.
[doctor]  Yes, that was crazy. What a what a finish, what an amazing, what an amazing tournament. Right, what do you think? Yeah, that's great. Well, we'll get you feeling better and get you back out there. And now are you still working a lot on the computer AC or?
[patient]  I am.
[doctor]  Carolyn, okay. Yeah, you're still working a lot on the computer for work. Okay, are you taking breaks every hour or so you know, get up, stand around, walk, stand, walk around that can be helpful.
[patient]  No, I really don't get the opportunity too.
[doctor]  Okay, understood. All right, well listen, let's go ahead and examine you okay. So on your physical exam, your physical exam is pretty normal, unremarkable for the most part. And you know a few things, a few exceptions. So first of all, on your heen exam, your eye exam, your extracurricular motions are intact. Without pain, you have a fundoscopic exam that shows no papaladema that's good that just means there's no swelling in the back. Of your eye and on your neck exam, you do have some posterior mild. Here you're paraspinal muscular tenderness in the cervical spine and in bilateral trapezius musculature as well and some tightness in those muscles as well. And otherwise on your exam, let's see your heart exam on your heart exam. You have that grade three out of six systolic ejection murmur that's unchanged from your prior exam. So it just means I hear some sounds in your heart as it's beating and I'm not too worried about that will. Watch that and otherwise normal heart exam and your physical examination otherwise is normal and unremarkable. And so now let's talk about my assessment and your plan. So Carolyn, for your first problem of the headache, I do think that you have a tension type headache. And I think this because you've got some tension and tightness in your paraspinal muscles, meaning the muscles around your neck and your shoulders. And you know working at the computer, I think, is contributing to this and also probably the stress so you can continue to take that Tylenol for the pain. I'm also going to give you a mild muscle relax and I'll write you for flexural five milligrams three times a day. And you can take that that will help relax those muscles in your neck and that should help with the symptoms I want you to come back or give us a call if the headaches become more severe or suddenly worse in or you develop a fever. But I don't think that this is a sign of a stroke or any bleeding in your brain or anything like that. I think it's more related to tightness in your muscles in your neck now for your second problem of your diabetes mellitus. Let's continue you on the metformin 500 milligrams. I am going to order a hemoglobin A1c and also a CBC and a chem 12 to check some of your blood tests, blood chemistries and so forth. And we will continue you on the metformin. I do want you to check your blood sugars daily and that will be very helpful. So when you come back in a month, I want you to bring those numbers with you. We can talk about it again and please do try to get back into your exercise routine. That's really going to help you keep those blood sugars under control as well. Okay. So how does that sound for a plan? Any other questions for me?
[patient]  What would it so only call if it gets worse or not any better?
[doctor]  Yeah, that that just right, but also let's set up an appointment in four weeks, and I want to see you back in four weeks. If it's not if the headache is not better within the next few days with this flexoril, then you can give us a call, and then get back in later this week, or early next, but definitely if things get worse, give us a call sooner. And you know, I'm going to ask you, and I wanted to ask if you had a history of any any trauma meaning have you. Hit your head, or you haven't fallen, hit your head, or anything like that have you.
[patient]  No, no, I think it's just stress.
[doctor]  Okay, all right, understood. Okay. Great. Well, then I'll see you back in a month if not before. Okay, you take care of yourself. Nice seeing you.
[patient]  Thank you.
[doctor]  Sure.","CHIEF COMPLAINT

[doctor]  Good so you know you got that knee x-ray when you first came in, but tell me a little bit about what happened.
[patient]  I was playing basketball and Jerry ran into me and the inside of my knee hurts.
[doctor]  Okay, did you fall to the ground or did you just kind of plant and he pushed and you went one way and you're needed?
[patient]  I did fall to the ground.
[doctor]  You did fall to the ground okay and did you land on the kneecap? I mean did it hurt a lot where you able to get up and continue on?
[patient]  I landed on my side. I was not able to continue on.
[doctor]  Okay, so you get off the off the court is Jerry a good player. You just got Ty asked that question.
[patient]  Not really.
[doctor]  No.
[patient]  He doesn't have much game.
[doctor]  Okay, okay. Well, you know I love basketball. I'm a little short for the game, but I absolutely love to watch basketball. So it's really cool that you're out there playing it. So tell me about a little bit about where it hurts.
[patient]  on the inside.
[doctor]  on the inside of it okay and after the injury did they do anything special for you or you know did you get ice on it right away or try anything.
[patient]  I had ice in an ace wrap.
[doctor]  You had ice and what?
[patient]  an ACE rap.
[doctor]  And an ace wrap okay. Now how many days ago was this exactly?
[patient]  7
[doctor]  Seven days ago, okay. Yeah, your right knee still looks a little swollen for seven days ago So I'm gonna go ahead and now I also see that you're diabetic and that you take 500 milligrams of metformin twice a day Are you still you're still on that medication is that correct?
[patient]  Correct.
[doctor]  And do you check your blood sugars every morning at home?
[patient]  Every morning.
[doctor]  Okay, great. And since this under reason I'm asking all these questions, I'm a little concerned about the inactivity with your knee pain. And you know how diabetes you need to be very, you know active, and then taking your medicine to keep that under control. So you know, may want to continue to follow up with your PCP for that diabetes as we go through here. And just watch your blood sugars extra as we go through that now I'm going to go ahead and examine your right knee. And when I push on the outside does that hurt at all?
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Okay and when I push on this inside where it's a little swollen does that hurt?
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  Yo, Cam just gonna ask a question, did you hear or feel a pop in your knee when you were doing this?
[patient]  I did not know.
[doctor]  You did not okay. Okay. What are you doing for the pain today?
[patient]  some exercises ice and motrin.
[doctor]  Okay, okay. So I'm going to continue all of my exam when I go ahead and pull on your knee. The first thing I'm looking at is I do see some echinosis and swelling on the inside of that right knee. And when I push around that knee, I can see that there's fluid in the knee, a little bit of fluid in the knee. We call that effusion. So I can appreciate some of that effusion and that could be either fluid or blood at this point from the injury that you had. Now you do have pain with palpation on the medial aspect of that right knee. And that's that's concerning for me when I'm going to just I just want to move your knee a little bit. It doesn't look like when I extend it and flex it that you have a full range of motion. Does it hurt a lot when I moved it back a little more than normal?
[patient]  Yes, it hurts.
[doctor]  Okay, okay. Yes, so you do have some decreased range of motion in that right knee now. I'm just going to sit here and lay you back and I'm going to pull on your knee and twist your knee a little bit. Okay, you currently there is a negative varus and balga stress test that's really important. So here's what I'm thinking for that right knee. I think you have may have a medial collateral ligament strain from, you know, maybe the twisting motion be right before you fell to the ground. I want you to continue to use an ace wrap. I'm going to give you a right knee brace. We're going to wear that for a few days. And then I'm going to send you to physical therapy so we can continue strengthening the muscles around the right knee now that X-ray as far as the X-ray results that X-ray that I did it this morning in the office, the bony alignments in good position. I don't see any evidence of any fractures. I do notice that the effusion around the right knee just a small amount of fluid, but we're just going to continue. To watch that I'm going to give you a prescription, I'd like you to stop taking any of the non-steroidals that you're taking the motrin or advelle whichever one of those. And I'm going to give you Miloxicam 15 milligrams. And I want you to take that daily for the pain and swelling. I want you to just continue exercising with the braces. And everything on so if you can you can get out and do some light walking, they'll be good. And then again for your diabetes, like I said, just continue to watch those blood sugars daily. And if you start to see any significant increase in them because of your loss of activity, just reach out to your primary care physician. Now, do you have any questions for me?
[patient]  What can I play basketball again?
[doctor]  Yeah, that's a great question I'm going to ask. Well, my first off, I want to see you back here and in seven days, you know, in a week, I want you to make an appointment. We're going to relook at it. We're going to determine if that's swelling got any worse. And if we need to go on to potentially ordering like a cat scan or an MRI of that need a look and see if there was any significant damage to the ligament. So that's for sure for seven days or not. Going to be playing basketball. Now, are you in a league or is that just you get like pick up basketball?
[patient]  I just pay it the Y for fun.
[doctor]  Okay, okay, good. That's a great activity. Like I said, I wish I could play now. I also know you're your family. Don't they own that sports store down right off of Main Street that sells a lot of sporting equipment?
[patient]  Yeah, they do.
[doctor]  Okay, I know I'm just thinking you know I need to get some new shoes for some of it my activities. I love the I wish I could play basketball but I do a lot of bike riding. So I'm always looking for anything that's going to help me on the bike. Do you does your family have supplies like that?
[patient]  We do let me know and I can get you the hook up.
[doctor]  Okay, great, great. So I'll let you know I'll just get on and take a look first, but I'm going to go ahead and get you discharged. I'll have my assistant come and we will get you discharged. And like I said, we will make an appointment for seven days and we will go from there any questions.
[patient]  I think you've answered them all. Thank you.
[doctor]  Okay, great.","CHIEF COMPLAINT

aci,ACI040,"[patient]  Hey Bruce, so see here my my notes here is you here he had positive lab work for HEPC so how were you doing today?
[doctor]  I'm doing okay, but I'm a little bit anxious about having Hepp's C. I've really surprised because I've been feeling fine they had done it as you know a screen as just part of my physical. So I'm really surprised that that came back positive.
[patient]  Okay, so in the past, have any doctors ever told you that you had Hep C?
[doctor]  No never that's why I'm so surprised.
[patient]  Okay, so just you know I need to ask do you have a history of four drug use or you know I've known any HEPC partners?
[doctor]  I mean I used to party a lot and even did use four drugs but I have been clean for over 15 years now.
[patient]  Okay, that's good. I mean, I'm happy that you were able to kick that habit. I know a lot of my patients that I see you know they're still dealing with with those demands. So I'm I'm happy that you're able to do that. So hopefully we can get you better okay.
[doctor]  Thank you.
[patient]  So what about alcohol use is that something that you use to do a lot.
[doctor]  I did, I mean, I still have a beer here and there every day, but not as much as I used to.
[patient]  Okay, and have you ever smoked before?
[doctor]  I do smoke, I smoke about one to two cigarettes per day, I've cut down a lot, but I'm just having a hard time kicking those less too.
[patient]  Yeah, yeah, and that's something about a work on too because hepsilong with smoking, you know, both of those aren't good. So hopefully we can help you out. You know, if your PCP hasn't prescribed something for you already, and possibly we can do that for you as well.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  So do you have any other medical conditions?
[doctor]  No, I'm actually other than that I just had my physical and I'm not taking any medications no, I'm pretty good otherwise.
[patient]  Okay, and what conditions would you say running your family?
[doctor]  I have high blood pressure diabetes and depression.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Alright, so let me go ahead and do a quick physical exam on you. So I reviewed your vitals and everything looks good. And on general appearance, you appear to be in no distress, no jaundice on the skin on your heart exam. You have a nice regular rhythm rate.
[patient]  Regular rate and rhythm with a grade two out of six istolic ejection murmur is appreciated on your lung. Exam your lungs are clear without weasers rals or ronkey on your abdominal exam ball sounds. A present your abdomen is soft with no hepatosplenamegaly.
[doctor]  Hepato's plenamegaly. Yes, let me. I will change that one.
[patient]  Splendor Megaly and on your muscle exam, there is no gate disturbance or edema. So I did what I was able to review your results of your recent lab work. And your HCV antibody test was positive. So you're your liver panel. We did one of those. And it showed an elevated AST at 39. But you're all albumin and total bilirubin were all within normal limits. So that's pretty good. So let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you. So you do have hepatitis C. So your initial labs were consistent with that hep C diagnosis. And so you know, I don't know if you read much about hep C. But hepatitis C is a viral infection that does affect your liver. And you've most likely had it for several years now. And it most patients don't see symptoms until years later. So the next step that I would like to do is just confirm the diagnosis with some additional blood work. So that includes checking your hep C RNA and your HCV genotype. And I would also like to determine the severity of your liver. Disease by checking for fibrosis of the liver. And we will do that by ordering an ultrasound alasto-elastography. With this information, we will be able to know how we can proceed as far as treatment writes. So how does that sound?
[doctor]  I am so, I do have a wife and kids, so should I be worried about them.
[patient]  Okay, yeah. So we can start with the same screening that you had for August first. So we'll just let's do that Hep C antibody test. And I'll actually help you set up those appointments with your family doctor. And then we can just see you back in three weeks. And based on the results, you know, we will take action as needed. Okay.
[doctor]  Okay, that sounds good.
[patient]  All right.
[doctor]  Alright.
[patient]  My nurse will be in with those orders.
[doctor]  All right, thank you.

aci,ACI044,"[doctor]  How are you doing?
[patient]  I'm doing I'm good, I'm doing really good I'm here. I'm just ready to quit smoking and but I've been having quite a hard time with it.
[doctor]  Well, I'm glad that you're taking the first steps to quit smoking. Would you tell me a little bit more about your history of smoking?
[patient]  Yeah, so I've been smoking for some time now, I started in high school and was just, you know, just experimenting and smoking here and there with friends or at parties and then just started getting more regular and regular and I don't even know how I'm 44 now and I'm smoking every day. So yes, now I'm up to a pack and half a day.
[doctor]  Okay, do you use any other type of tobacco products?
[patient]  No smoking is enough.
[doctor]  Okay, and I understand that so. When you wake up in the morning, how soon after waking up, do you smoke your first cigarette?
[patient]  I would say probably within an hour of waking up, I'll have my first cigarette.
[doctor]  Okay, so I'm really excited that you want to quit and I know that you probably heard this multiple times before. But this really is one of the best things that you can do to help your health especially since you have the history of Gout and type 2 diabetes. This is really going to be a great step in you having better long term health outcomes.
[patient]  Yeah, I know and you know I'm really motivated now because I am about to be a father any day now and I just really want to be there for my daughter growing up
[doctor]  Hey, that's great. And that's great to hear. Congratulations. I'm so excited to hear about the new baby.
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  I have a daughter myself, have you picked out any names?
[patient]  Where you know we're deciding between a few names, but we're kind of just waiting to see her to see which name fits.
[doctor]  Okay, all right, that sounds good. Well, congratulations again. I'm very excited for you and your, and your wife that that's this is great.
[patient]  Thank you.
[doctor]  So you mentioned you tried to quit before. Can you tell me a little bit about the methods that you used or what you tried?
[patient]  Yeah, actually I just went cold turkey one day. I woke up and I said, you know, I've had enough. And I know that smoking is not good for me. So I woke up and stopped. And I actually did really well. And I was able to quit smoking for almost a year. And then things just started getting really stressful at work. They started laying people off. And I'm happy. I still have a job. But that also meant that I was responsible for more things so things just got stressful. And I just started picking it up again.
[doctor]  While you are absolutely correct you know stress can often be a trigger for things like smoking and drinking have you thought what you would do this time when you encountered the stressful situations.
[patient]  Yeah, I didn't think about that a lot actually, and one thing is I have started learning and trying to do more meditation, and then I also just recently joined the gym. So I'm really looking forward to working out again.
[doctor]  Okay, well that's great to hear that you're getting back in the gym that will be good for your long-term health too. You know helping to maintain that type 2 diabetes. You know those are really great strategies talking about gym for stress relief. And you know we have other products as well that you can use for an additional aid to help you stop smoking. Have you given any thought to using some type of smoking cessation aid at this time? Or what do you think about that?
[patient]  You know I've had you know because I've been trying to do cold turkey and it's not working and some of my friends actually have mentioned using a patch and they they've had some success with that. So I think I would probably want to start with that.
[doctor]  Okay, all right, that sounds good. It's good that you've picked out one of those aids and have you thought of a quit date. I mean, we really want to talk about when you're going to say this is the day.
[patient]  Yano next Monday is actually my birthday. So, I think that's a good day.
[doctor]  That's a fantastic day, and Happy Birthday coming up on Monday.
[patient]  Thank you.
[doctor]  So let's talk a little bit about your exam here, okay? I'm gonna go ahead and do a quick physical exam, and I reviewed your vitals, and everything looks good, including your oxygen saturation blood pressure for today, was 128 over 88 heart rate, was 68 respirations were 16, and your pulse ox was 98% on room air. So those were all really good now on your heart exam, you do have a nice regular. And your your rate is a regular rate and rhythm or I'm. Sorry, your heart exam for your heart exam notice that your heart is regular in rate, and rhythm I do however still appreciate that two over six isolic murmur that we talked about in the past now, that's okay, we'll just continue to monitor that now for your lung exam. I'm gonna go ahead and listen to your lungs, your lungs are clear and equal bilateral with no expiratory weasers and no rals or ronkey are appreciated on your. Next exam, I don't appreciate any lymphedena pathi. When I listen, I don't. Here, any extra noises, so I don't hear any hearing, any carotid brute, which is a good thing now for my impression and plan. Let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you. So for your first problem of nicotine dependence, first of all, I just wanna apply you on making this first step to stop smoking. And I want you to know with absolute 100% certainty that I'm gonna be with you every step of the way I think. It's fantastic that you're very welcome, I, I think it's. Fantastic you've chosen next Monday as a quit date. And on that day, I'm gonna start you with a 21 milligram nicotine patch. And the goal will be to decrease that over time okay. Now we will work together to decrease that. So there is no necessarily hard dates in mind okay. Be sure to change the patch location each day. And that's going to help reduce or avoid that skin irritation that can occur if you use the same location over and over. Again, I would like to see you again in two weeks just to. See how things are going. And we will reevaluate at that time the dosage for your nicotine patch. Now we also see further need to discuss any handouts you received today for those common smoking triggers. I really want you to keep an eye on and monitor your stress level not only about work, but also the fact that you are experiencing are going to be a new father. And we really want to watch any stress you will be experiencing around the birth of your new child. So please keep an eye on that. And let me know how that goes now for now until we meet in two weeks go ahead and keep up your exercise routine. I think that's a great plan. And just try to monitor your stress. And then maybe think about some things like meditation or adding in some yoga and that type of thing to help further work with your stress levels. So do you have any questions for me?
[patient]  No, not at this time.
[doctor]  Okay, so for your other conditions that we talked about briefly, your second condition of type 2 diabetes, well let's go ahead and continue to maintain that with diet and exercise. And we'll just monitor your type 2 diabetes. I am going to go ahead and order a hemoglobin A1c for your next blood draw, since I'll see you in two weeks go ahead and have that done. And we will talk about that when you come back in now for your third. Problem of your history of gout. Let's go ahead and continue you on your alopeurinal and just you know continue to watch those foods that will exacerbate your uric acid levels any other questions about those.
[patient]  Now I think I'd thank so much.
[doctor]  All right, sounds good. I'll see you in two weeks. Congratulations on the baby and and we're excited about next Monday. That's your quick date.
[patient]  Alrighty, thank you.
[doctor]  You're welcome. I'll see you in two weeks. Thanks. Bye. Bye.

aci,ACI048,"[doctor]  Hey Linda, good to see you today. So looking here and my notes looks like you think you have a kidney stone think you've had them before and and you I guess you're having some pain and while we are here I see you I see you have a you have past medical history of hypertension diabetes and we will check up on those as well. So with your kidney stone can you tell me what happened what's going on?
[patient]  And I've been in a lot of pain it started about, I would say, probably about three days ago.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  started having pain on my left back.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  And since then I continue to have pain is traveling a little lower, it's gone a little low. But I definitely have not passed it yet. And I'm just in so much pain.
[doctor]  Okay, so is the pain that you're having as it constant or does it come and go?
[patient]  It's constant.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  all the time I can't get comfortable.
[doctor]  All right are you able to urinate?
[patient]  I am and this morning I actually started seeing some blood.
[doctor]  Okay, yes so and I know you said I see you've had some kidney stones in the past like how many times would you say you've had one of these episodes
[patient]  I've had it for probably this might be my third time.
[doctor]  Third time alright.
[patient]  Yeah, I haven't had one in a while, but yeah, this is my third time.
[doctor]  Okay, so have you noticed any nausea chill's fever?
[patient]  No fever, some chills, and I just in so much pain, I can't eat, and I do feel a little nauseous.
[doctor]  Okay, that sound definitely understandable. So you've been in a lot of pain, so have you tried to take any medications to alleviate the pain?
[patient]  Yeah, I've been taking Tylenol. I have had to try some ibuprofen. I know you said to be careful with my blood pressure, but I've been trying to do that because I'm just in so much pain and it's not really working.
[doctor]  Okay, and before what would you how long would you say it took you to pass the other stones or how was that that resolved?
[patient]  It usually usually about about three, four days to pass it you.
[doctor]  Right, so this is the looks like this is the third day.
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  So we are getting close there.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Yes, so hopefully we can pass it, but we'll definitely, we can take a look at it here in a second. So while you are here, I also wanted to check up on your diabetes and hypertension you have. So I'm looking here at my notes and you're on two. Five of Norbask for your high blood pressure when you came in today, your blood pressure was a little bit high. And I know that's probably because you are in a bunch of pain, so that definitely makes sense. But I think last time we talked a little bit about you getting a blood pressure cuff and taking your blood pressures regularly. So those readings first off, were you able to get the blood pressure cuff.
[patient]  I was I haven't been great about taking it, but I did get the blood pressure cuff.
[doctor]  So the time that you did take it and I think that's something we got to work on is you've taken them. I think at least three times a week I would like you to what have those been running.
[patient]  Like the top numbers, they're usually the 130's. Sometimes I get, I do go into 140's and once it went to like 150.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  And then the bottom number has been between 70 and 80 okay. That I mean, that's not too bad I think. When you were first diagnosed, you were up there in the...
[doctor]  The 180's, which was really high.
[patient]  Right?
[doctor]  So let me talk a little bit also about you trying to lower your salt intake to like like 2300 milligrams a day. So have you been able to do that?
[patient]  Try my best, but Doc, I really like my French fries.
[doctor]  Yeah
[patient]  Like.
[doctor]  We all like the French fries, you know, but, you know, we also don't like strokes, so we don't want to have a scope and all the all the French fries. So that's something definitely I would like you to work on. And do you think you'd be able to curb that French fry habit or that bad, this bad food habits by yourself? Or do you think you need help?
[patient]  Yes, some help could be helpful. Okay, yeah. We can definitely get you connected with someone just to help you with your diet. Kind of that's the biggest thing for a lot of my patient is trying to control that diet all right.
[doctor]  So I also want to take a look here at your diabetes. And last time you came in your A1C was a little bit higher at 7. 3 and you're on 500 of metformin currently. So have you been taking your blood sugars before you eat every day?
[patient]  I have and those those have been pretty good they are like in the low one hundreds.
[doctor]  Okay, that's definitely good because when you came and I think we did a glucose test on you couple of months ago and you were around 300 which is pretty up there. So I'm glad that you know those levels are down and have you been taking that metaphor in every day.
[patient]  I do.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  I do take it.
[doctor]  That's really good. All right. So let me do a quick physical exam on you just a couple of questions before I take a look at your abdomen and your back talk to take a look at that that kidney stones are having. So I just want to make sure are you having any any chest pain?
[patient]  No chest pain.
[doctor]  No chest pain are you having any belly pain?
[patient]  The back pain is starting to kind of go down into my groin, but I wouldn't say any back pain, I mean abdominal pain.
[doctor]  No abdominal pain, alright? So let me check here, I'm gonna listen to your heart real quick. And so on your heart exam, I do hear a grade two out of six systolic ejection murmur and that we knew about that already, so not really worried about that. Currently listen to your lungs or lungs are clear bilaterally. I don't hear any crackles or weasers. So let me press here on your abdomen, does that hurt?
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  Okay I'm going to press here on your back is that painful.
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  Alright, so on your examination of your abdomen, there is tenderness to palpation of the abdomen, there isn't any rebound or guarding, though. And only there is also CVA tenderness on the right on your flank as well. And so it seems to me you know that you do have that kidney stone, looks like you do have some inflammation around your kidney, that's what that's that tenderness around your CVA is is telling me, so let's go talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so you know. Right now, because of your history of having kidney stones, you do have a kidney stone. So what we're going to do is first off, I'm going to get you some pain medication kind of you're in a ton of pain right now, I'm going to prescribe you some oxycodone 5 milligrams. You can take that every six to eight hours as needed for pain. And so hopefully that can help you feeling better and you can continue to take that Tylenol for any breakthrough pain that you're having. I do want to make sure that you're pushing fluids right now because we need to try to push that stone out that you're having just kind of clear your kidneys and that that would definitely help I also want to give you a strainer. So you can strain your urine to see if you do actually pass that stone and then I'm going to refer you to urology. And we're actually I'm going to have you even if you pass a stone in the next couple of days, I want you to go anyway because it seems like you're having recurrent kidney stones and so hopefully they can help do something to to help this from happening in the future for your hypertension. I'm going to keep you on that too. Five norvask your blood pressures look good. So I'm not going to make any changes there and then for your diabetes, we'll keep you on the 500 of metformin. And I also want to give you a referral to nutrition to a dietitian and they will be able to help you with your diet. I know you said you have a few issues so you know they can possibly write a diet for you and if you follow it, you know, hopefully in the future we can get you off of both of these medications and get you back to normal. So how does that all sound?
[patient]  That sounds good, and I just want this pain to go away, so thank you.
[doctor]  Okay, no problem.","CHIEF COMPLAINT

aci,ACI050,"[doctor]  Alright, you can go ahead.
[patient]  Hey Alan, I good to see you today. So I looked here my appointment notes and I see that you're coming in you had some shoulder pain left shoulder pain for the last three weeks so.
[doctor]  How you doing is it is it gotten any better?
[patient]  Yeah, yeah. I've been having a lot of pain in my shoulder for the last three weeks now, and it's not getting better. Okay, do you remember what you were doing when the pain first started?
[doctor]  So I was thinking that I can't recall like falling on it injuring it getting hit.
[patient]  Hmm.
[doctor]  I've been doing a lot of work in my basement and I even I put in a new ceiling. So I don't know if it's from all that activity doing that, but otherwise that's all I can think of.
[patient]  Okay, so do you remember hitting it or anything like that?
[doctor]  Know nothing at all.
[patient]  Okay, all right, did you fall? Do you remember doing that?
[doctor]  No.
[patient]  Okay, I'm so like a little mystery. So have you had pain in that shoulder before?
[doctor]  I mean, I'm very active so I can get pains in my shoulders, but it's nothing that sometimes some Tylenol can help.
[patient]  Okay, and are you able to move the arm or is it kind of just stuck?
[doctor]  I'm having a lot of pain like I can move it, but you know when I try to reach for something lifting anything. And even like I don't even try to put my hands over my head because it causes so much pain.
[patient]  All right, so does that pain radiate anywhere or like where would you say it is in your shoulder?
[doctor]  It actually it stays pretty much just right at the shoulder. It doesn't go down anywhere.
[patient]  Okay, and the pain is it is it all the time or does it come and go?
[doctor]  It's pretty much all the time, any time I put any pressure on it like when I'm trying to sleep at hertz even more so it's been affecting my sleep as well.
[patient]  Okay, so I know you mentioned Tylenol, so this time I haven't taken anything for it.
[doctor]  Yeah, I do the Tylenol, which usually works for me. And it does take the edge off, but I still have pain okay, did you try icing it at all?
[patient]  I iced it initially, but I haven't iced it at all recently.
[doctor]  Alright.
[patient]  And so with your shoulder have you experienced any numbness in your arm or in your fingers.
[doctor]  No numbness or tingling.
[patient]  Okay, good. So I'm going to go ahead and do a quick physical exam and take a look at your shoulder. So I reviewed your vitals. Everything looks good with that so touch here in your shoulder. So your left shoulder exam, you have limited active and passive range of motion. So pressure here so that there is tenderness of the greater.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  To baracity of a humorous let's see, there is no tenderness at the sternoclavicular or acro.
[doctor]  Yeah
[patient]  Acromioclavicular joints.
[doctor]  Yeah, yeah.
[patient]  And looks like you have good hand grip. Let me see. So on the Neurovascular Exam of your left arm or capillary refill, is less than three seconds, and your sensation is as intact to light touch.
[doctor]  Yes, thank you, Yap.
[patient]  So you did get what we had to get an x-ray of your shoulder before you came in. And so it's normal. So that's really good. So there's no fractures, no bony abnormalities. So let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you. So you do have that left shoulder pain. So your symptoms are...
[doctor]  most likely due to a rotator cuff tendonopathy. So this means that you injure tendon, you have injured tendons and muscles that make up your shoulder and make up your shoulder muscles. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to order an MRI of your left shoulder.
[patient]  And so we're going to begin with that just to make sure nothing else is going on. Have you done physical therapy before?
[doctor]  I haven't.
[patient]  Okay, so what I'm going to do, I'm going to refer you to physical therapy for approximately six to eight weeks. And so they can help you strengthen those muscles around your shoulder, and that should definitely help with the pain during that time. You can also continue to take Tylenol. I don't think I need to prescribe anything else for the pain you said as it's working pretty good for you. So if your symptoms don't improve, we can consider steroid. Injection of your shoulder, which should provide some relief. But I think right now we can just go with the point and hopefully that works to alleviate your injury. So do you have any questions about the plan?
[doctor]  So like I said, I'm really active. Do you think that this pain will ever go away?
[patient]  Yeah, so many patients are very successful with rehab. And so we'll start with that and see how you do most most of the time. Once we build up those muscles around that shoulder, you know things, things, the pain, alleviates itself. And and you'll be good to go back to working on your basement and running and jogging and lifting weights, all all the active things people do these days.
[doctor]  Okay, alright, thank you.
[patient]  Bye.
[doctor]  Okay, bye.","CHIEF COMPLAINT

He denies any numbness or tingling in his left arm or fingers. He has been taking Tylenol for pain, which provides partial relief. He initially iced his shoulder but has not iced it recently. The patient denies he has done any physical therapy.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports left shoulder pain. Neurological: Denies numbness or tingling.

VITALS

All vital signs are within the normal limits.

PHYSICAL EXAM

MSK: Examination of the left shoulder: Limited active and passive ROM. Tenderness over the greater tuberosity of the humerus. No tenderness at the sternoclavicular or AC joints. Good hand grip. Neurovascularly intact distally. Capillary refill is less than 3 seconds. Sensation is intact to light touch distally.

RESULTS

X-rays of the left shoulder were obtained and reviewed today. These are normal and reveal no fracture or bony abnormalities.

ASSESSMENT

Left shoulder pain, likely rotator cuff tendinopathy.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with him regarding his current symptoms. I have explained that his x-rays did not reveal any signs of a fracture. I have recommended that we obtain an MRI of the left shoulder to evaluate for possible rotator cuff tendinopathy. The patient was provided with a referral to formal physical therapy. He will engage in a 6-to-8-week course in order to strengthen his left shoulder. I have also advised him to take Tylenol as needed for pain. If his symptoms do not improve, we may consider a steroid injection to the left shoulder.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me once the MRI results are available for review and further discussion."
aci,ACI053,"[doctor]  Karen Nelson is a three-year-old female with no significant past medical history, who comes in for evaluation of a new right-eye twitch Karen is accompanied by her father high care and how are you
[patient]  I'm okay I guess.
[doctor]  Hey Dad, how are you doing?
[patient]  Hey Doc, I am okay. Yeah, Karen has been having this. I twitch. I noticed a couple of weeks ago when I talked to her pediatrician and they told me to come see you.
[doctor]  Okay, alright, so Karen have you felt the twitch?
[patient]  Yeah, one minute I feel my face sometimes.
[doctor]  Yeah, and do you have any pain when it happens?
[patient]  No, it doesn't really hurt, but I noticed that dad looks real nervous when it happens.
[doctor]  Yeah, I, I can understand that's because he loves you. Do you feel the urge to move your face?
[patient]  Sometimes and then it moves and then I feel better.
[doctor]  Okay, okay. And so so dad, how often are you seeing the Twitch on Karen?
[patient]  I don't know, I mean it varies sometimes. I see it several times an hour in. There's other days we don't see it at all until sometimes late afternoon, but we definitely notice it every day for the last several weeks.
[doctor]  Okay, so Karen Howe's Howe's Howe Soccer.
[patient]  I like soccer.
[doctor]  Yeah
[patient]  Yet dad dad takes me to play every Saturday.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  It's pretty fun, but there's this girl named Isabella. She plays rough.
[doctor]  Does she?
[patient]  She as she tries to kick me and she pulls my hair and...
[doctor]  Oh
[patient]  Sometimes she's not very nice.
[doctor]  That isn't very nice you're gonna have to show her, that that's not very nice you're gonna have to teach her a lesson.
[patient]  Yeah, and then sometimes after soccer we go and I get Madougas in it and it's a make for a nice day with dad.
[doctor]  is that your favorite Amic Donalds in the Menugates.
[patient]  Not really, but they are cheap so.
[doctor]  Okay, alright, well you made Dad happy at least right.
[patient]  Yeah, that's what he says because I'm expensive because I want dresses and dogs and stuff all the time.
[doctor]  Yeah, well, yeah, who does it well? Okay. Well, hopefully we will get you know squared away here. So you can you know play your soccer and go shopping for dresses with dad. So so dad tell me does the Karen seam bothered or any other and have any other issues when this happens.
[patient]  No, I mean, when it happens, she just continues playing or doing whatever she was doing when it happens.
[doctor]  Okay, alright. Has she, has she otherwise been feeling okay since the started? Has she been acting normally?
[patient]  I'd say she seems fine, I mean she's been eating well and playing with her friends and she goes about her normal activities really.
[doctor]  Okay good.
[patient]  Never, even though anything was going on.
[doctor]  Okay, alright, good. So, has his Karen had any seizures in the past?
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  No, okay. And then so tell me when the twitch occurs, do you ever notice any, you know, parts of her like moving or twitching?
[patient]  Well, no, it's just her face.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  I mean the whole side of her face moves when it happens. It seems like it's several seconds and then it finally stops and she just seems to be blinking frequently and and then you know wait a minute I did make a video so you can see just in case it doesn't do it during the visit.
[doctor]  Okay, okay, yeah that would be great to see that because I want to see what's going on so thank you for that tell me is there any family history of seizures or like Tourette syndrome.
[patient]  Well, no history of seizures, but I never heard of that Tourette thing.
[doctor]  Yes, so so torrid is that it's a nervous system disorder that you know involves like repetitive movements or like unwanted sounds and it typically begins in childhood and I don't know have you noticed anything like that with her when she was younger.
[patient]  Really, I had nobody in our family got anything like that.
[doctor]  Okay, now tell me have you noticed any other symptoms how about like fever or chills?
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Okay, coughing headache.
[patient]  Man.
[doctor]  Okay, how about any problems with care and sleep?
[patient]  Nope.
[doctor]  Okay, okay, good, let's go ahead and do physical exam on Karen here. All right, Karen, I'm just going to take a look at you and ask you to follow some commands, okay?
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Alright, can you follow my finger with your eyes good now? Can you do me a favor walk across the room for me? Great job. Okay. Now I want you to close your eyes and reach out your arms in front of you good now. Keep your eyes closed. Can you feel me touch you here? How about okay? How about there?
[patient]  MM
[doctor]  Does that feel the same?
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  Okay, all right, so I'm just going to check your reflexes. Okay, all right, now when you're on the neurological exam, the patient is awake alert, and oriented times three speech is clear and flu and gate is steady heel toe walking is normal, and the cranial nerves are intact. Without focal neurologic findings, there is no pronator drift sensation. As intact reflexes are two plus and symmetric at the biceps, triceps, knees, and ankles. So this means everything looks good, Karen.
[patient]  That's great!
[doctor]  Good alright, so I'm gonna go ahead and tell you what we're gonna do, so I'm gonna tell you my assessment and plan here so dad. So for the first problem, I do believe that Karen does have a tick-eye ticks or very common in children, and as many as you know one in five children have a tick during their school years, and ticks can also include things like shoulder shrugging facial grimacing, sniffling, excessive throat clearing, and uncontrolled vocalization eye. Can say that essentially they're brief sudden. And in voluntary motor movements, now we don't have a full understanding of the cause of the ticks, but they typically occur around five to ten years of age, but most ticks go away on their own, and they disappear within a year. So these are what we call transient ticks, and the best thing to do is ignore the ticks, so it doesn't seem to be bothering Karen, and she seems to be doing well in school and activities. So it may wax and wane over time, but you might notice it more towards the end of the day when the child is tired, so you may also you know see it if they're stressed. So that's why it's important to just ignore it now when you draw attention to the tick, it does make the child conscious, so that can make the tick worse. So we want to be careful again, just to kind of not to draw too much attention on it. And do you have any questions for me?
[patient]  So you mean you're telling me you don't think you had a seizure or a bit or nothing?
[doctor]  Yeah, I don't think it's I don't think so because it is the same part of her body that's moving every time that and she reports that it's somewhat of an there is an urge to blink her eye and some relief afterwards.
[patient]  So you're not recommending any kind of treatment. There is no pill or cream or nothing.
[doctor]  Not at this time because she seems to be doing well overall, and the tick hasn't impacted her school or her activities. But if it worsens then we can consider some treatment okay.
[patient]  Alright, alright, sounds good.
[doctor]  Alright, thank you guys, have a good day!
[patient]  Doctor.

Right eye twitch.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient plays soccer every Saturday, however she has noted that there is a girl that tries to kick her and pulls her hair.

FAMILY HISTORY

Patient's father reports that they do not have a family history of seizures or Tourette's syndrome.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Constitutional: Denies fever, chills, or changes in appetite.
Eyes: Reports right eye twitch. Denies right eye pain.
Respiratory: Denies cough.
Neurological: Denies headaches or sleep disturbances.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Neurological
- Orientation: Alert and oriented x3. Speech is clear and fluent. Gait is steady. Heel toe walking is normal. Cranial nerves grossly intact without focal neurologic findings. No pronator drift. Sensation is intact. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetric at the biceps, triceps, knees, and ankles.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Transient tics.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient's father provided a video today as she did not have a twitch in office. It appears the patient is experiencing a tic.
- Patient Education and Counseling: Nature of the diagnosis was discussed today with the patient and her father. I advised eye tics are very common in children and as many as 1 in 5 children have a tick during their school years. We discussed tics can also include things like shoulder shrugging, facial grimacing, sniffling, excessive throat clearing, and uncontrolled vocalization. I explained that essentially they are brief, sudden and involuntary motor movements and that we do not have a full understanding of the cause. We also discussed that they typically occur around 5 to 10 years of age and mostly resolve on their own within a year. Dad was advised that treatment is not recommended as they do not appear to be bothering Karen and she continues to do well in school and activities. Additionally, we discussed avoiding drawing attention to the tic as it may cause Karen to feel self-conscious and increase the severity of the tic.
- Medical Treatment: None at this time.

Patient Agreements: The patient's parent understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

[patient]  Hey, Documents, I don't know I'm doing alright, I guess.
[doctor]  Just alright, how's it?
[patient]  Well
[doctor]  How's it been since you've had your heart attack? Have you been, have you been doing alright?
[patient]  No, I've been seeing you for years since I had my last heart attack in 2018, but I've been doing pretty good. I can't believe this happened again. I mean, I'm doing okay. I guess I just feel tired ever now and then, but overall, I mean, I guess I feel pretty well.
[doctor]  Okay good were you able to enjoy the spring weather?
[patient]  Yeah, so I mean I'm hoping now that I've had my little procedure that I'll feel better and feel like getting back out and and maybe doing some walking there some new trails here behind the rec center and maybe get out and walk those trails.
[doctor]  That will be fine, I know you love walking the trails. I know you like looking at the flowers because I think you plan a lot of flowers as well don't you especially around this time.
[patient]  Yeah, I do some gardening around the house.
[doctor]  Yeah
[patient]  And you know I really like photography too being able to go out and take nature pictures.
[doctor]  Yeah
[patient]  So I'm hoping to be able to go out and do that.
[doctor]  Okay, well, we'll do what we can here to get you out and going doing all those fun activities again. Now, tell me have you had any chest pain or any shortness of breath.
[patient]  No, not really no chest pain or shortness of breath I've been doing some short walks right around the house. So like around the block.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  But I stay pretty close to the house, I've been doing some light house keeping, and I don't know I seem to be doing okay, I think.
[doctor]  Okay, alright, now tell me are you able to lay flat at night when you sleep or?
[patient]  1 min I never have truly laid flat on my back. I've always slept with two pillows which is normal for me.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  So I mean I guess I really don't have any troubles with my sleeping.
[doctor]  Okay, good how about are your legs swelling up?
[patient]  Nope, I've always had skinny ankles like I got Dawn Nautz legs.
[doctor]  Well, that's cute were you able to afford your medications and are you taking them as prescribed?
[patient]  You have to take them on medicine, I got pretty good insurance there through the plant. And so the copay isn't too bad.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  And I've been taking them because I don't want my sense to close up and they told me that that to take them this, you know, all the time. And I've been taking them since I got out of the hospital.
[doctor]  Okay, well very good. I'm glad you're doing that good for your Russell. And then please keep that up now. Tell me are you watching your salt intake and trying to change your diet?
[patient]  Yeah, so when I was in the hospital, they said something about my way my heart pumps now.
[doctor]  Hmm.
[patient]  It's just a little low and I might keep fluid on my legs if I'm not careful.
[doctor]  Right.
[patient]  And it's going to be hard because, you know, I really do like pizza. And they told me that I'm really going to have to watch salt. And they said that there's a lot of salt in pizza.
[doctor]  There is a lot of salt and pizza, and you know, and you're going to have to be able to avoid all the other salty foods as well. So, and I know that's hard, but it's very important for your heart to be able to function at its best right. And you want to be able to get out and walk, you know, walk, take those walks again at the park, and then you know to your photography. So, in order to do that, we're going to have to really cut back on those, okay.
[patient]  Well
[doctor]  Alright, so why don't we go ahead and do a quick physical exam on you here? I just want to take a look at your vital signs, look good, I'm glad to see you're tolerating the medication. While I'm going to go ahead and feel your neck here, I don't appreciate any jugular venous distension and there are no carotid brutes on your heart exam. There is a three out of six six systolic ejection murmur. It's heard at the left base, but that's pretty much. The same as last year, so we'll continue to monitor that. Okay, let me listen to your lungs here real quick, Russell your lungs are clear, so good, good in your extremities. I don't see any swelling or edema on your right radial artery, the cath side, there is clean and it's dry and intact and I don't see any hematoma, so that's good. And there is a palpable raw pulse. So Russell, I did review the results of your EKG, which showed normal sinus rhythm, good, our wave progression and evolutionary changes, which are anticipated. So let's go ahead and talk about my assessment plan for you for your first diagnosis of coronary artery disease, we are going to have you continue your aspirin 81 milligrams daily and brilinta 90 milligrams twice daily. And we're going to have you continue on that high dose statin that adervasted in you might call it lipitor 80 milligrams daily. And then also continue on that toprol 50 milligrams daily. Okay, and I'm also going to refer you to cardiac rehab. So for you to get some education about your heart and also give you the confidence to get back exercising regularly. Now I know patients love the cardiac rehab program. I think you'll do well. Does that sound good to you?
[patient]  That sounds good document.
[doctor]  Alright, so for your second diagnosis here, the newly reduced left ventricular dysfunction and moderate mitral regurgitation, I think your pumping function will improve in time you know they got you to the lab quickly. So I think that heart muscle is just stunned and you're very compliant, you're very good with your medications and following through with those. So I think it will recover. So that said, I want you to go ahead and continue, continue. Your lice in April, 20 milligrams a day, I don't think. You need a diuretic at this time, but I do want to add al-dactone 12. 5 milligrams daily and then you'll need to get labs next week okay and then we're going to repeat another echocardiogram echocardiogram in about two months.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Okay, and then for your hypertension, your third diagnosis of hypertension, I wanted to take your blood pressure just like you would you know every so often, and then because your blood pressure actually seemed fine at this time, so we will continue to monitor that, and I think you will tolerate the L-dactone well as well.
[patient]  Alright sounds good document.
[doctor]  Okay, well you take care, and you have a good evening.
[patient]  Yeah you too.

[patient]  Now I have a little bit of a stuffy nose not too bad, it's really just my throat, but I think my tonsils are swollen too.
[doctor]  and your tonsils are swollen too now has anyone else sick in your household.
[patient]  I do have little kids that go to school. So they've always got you know those little running noses or cough, but nobody is really complaining of anything.
[doctor]  Okay, alright now have you had strep throw in the past?
[patient]  When I was a kid I had strep throat, but I haven't had anything like that as an adult.
[doctor]  Okay, alright. And what do you do for work?
[patient]  I work as a cashier in the supermarket.
[doctor]  Okay, all right. And did you get your COVID vaccine?
[patient]  Yep, I did get my COVID vaccine, but it really made me feel sick, so I'm hoping I don't have to get another one later this year.
[doctor]  Okay, did. So you just got the two vaccines you didn't get the booster.
[patient]  Now I didn't get the booster because I really haven't had time to feel that sick again. It really knocked me down for like two days and with the little kids it's really hard.
[doctor]  Okay, all right, well I saw that they did a rapid COVID test when you came in here. And that was negative, so that's good, so you don't have COVID, which is which is good now. Let's talk a little bit about your hypertension and hypertension since I have you here to do ever by that blood pressure cuff that I ask you to buy.
[patient]  Yes, I did, I blood the blood pressure cuff, and my blood pressure is like all over the place. Sometimes it could be like 120 for the top number, sometimes it could be 140 for the top number. I don't really remember the bottom number though.
[doctor]  Okay, that's okay. Are you taking the lysinopril? I think we have you on 20 milligrams a day.
[patient]  Yep, I take it every morning with my multivitamin and my vitamin D.
[doctor]  Okay, alright, and are you watching your salt intake?
[patient]  I really like my chips with my wine.
[doctor]  Isn't that the best way we could get along really well outside of here, all right? And then tell me a little bit about your diabetes. Now, are you watching your blood sugars? Are you taking them at home?
[patient]  Sometimes I take that all that often again, that could be all over the place. Sometimes I get if I take it first thing in the morning it'll be like 80 or 90, but at night sometimes it could be 140.
[doctor]  Okay, all right. And I are you still taking them at 4, and we have you on a thousand milligrams twice a day.
[patient]  Yes, I do take it, I take it with my breakfast and with my dinner.
[doctor]  Okay, all right, great. All right. Now are you a meds fan or a Yankees fan or God for a bit of Philly's fan?
[patient]  Nope.
[doctor]  No.
[patient]  They don't like sports.
[doctor]  Don't like sports just the wine.
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Okay, all right. Well, let's go ahead. I want to just do a quick physical exam. Now I'm going to be calling out some of my findings and I'm going to let you know what that means when I'm done. Okay. So looking here first at your vital signs, your vital signs look pretty good. You do have a low grade fever of about a hundred for right now. But otherwise your blood pressure is pretty good. It's about 132 over 80 and your heart rate is 84 now. That looks pretty good. So I'm just going to go ahead and examine you. So on your facial exam, I'm going to just press on your face here. Does this hurt?
[patient]  No, not no, it doesn't bother me.
[doctor]  Okay, on facial examination, the patient has no pain to palpation of the frontal or maxillary sinuses on nasal examination. There is edema and erythema of the nasal terminates, bilaterally, with associated clear discharge, open up your mouth and say.
[patient]  Ah
[doctor]  On throat examination, there is bilateral erythema and edema of the peritonsular space, with exudates present bilaterally the uvula is midline on your neck exam. I do appreciate some cervical lymphedenopathy on the right hand side on your lung exam. Your lungs, you have some coarse ronky at the bases that clear with cough, and on your heart exam, your heart is a nice regular rate. And rhythm, I don't appreciate any. Murmur or rub. So what does all of that mean to Risa? So all of that means is that yes. You're showing signs of what we call an upper respiratory infection. And I'm concerned that you might have some strep in the back of your throat based on the findings. So let's just talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you okay. So for your first problem of your sore throat, I'm going to go ahead and have the medical assistant come in and swab you for a rapid strep test. And if that's positive, I want to go ahead and place you on or prescribe a Moxicillin 500 milligrams three times a day for 10 days. And I'm going to give you some Lydocaine swish and swallow so that will help with some of the pain. And you can take some ibuprofen as needed, which will also help with the pain. And some of that fever, okay, I do want you to go ahead and continue to to hydrate as much as possible what kind of questions do you have about that.
[patient]  Know that sounds good, I just wanted to be sure I was okay, because of the little kids.
[doctor]  Sure now for your next problem of your hypertension, I want to go ahead and order a lipid panel on you. And I think I do want to increase, I do want to increase the lysinopryl to 40 milligrams once a day just to get your blood pressure under better control. And we'll see how you do on the 40 milligrams once a day for your third problem of your diabetes. Let's go ahead and order a hemoglobin A1c and just to make sure that we don't have to make any adjustments to your metformin. How does that sound?
[patient]  Sounds good.
[doctor]  Any questions?
[patient]  Note that's everything.

aci,ACI069,"[doctor]  Well, hello, Christina. So how are you doing? I was notified you were in the hospital for some heart failure. What happened?
[patient]  While I'm doing better now, but I just started having problems that my ankles were swelling and couldn't get them to go down even when I went to bed and couldn't breathe very good how to get propped up in bed. So I could breathe at night. And so I just really got a feeling bad. I called my friend, I and she said I probably ought to call 911 since I was having a hard time talking. And so I called 911 and they sent out an ambulance and they took me into the urn and it was quite an experience.
[doctor]  Yeah
[patient]  having an ambulance ride and I've never done that before so not an experience I want to do again either.
[doctor]  I'm sure you don't yet, I see that your blood pressure was high also, it was 200 over 90 have you been.
[patient]  Yeah, I guess is it really high?
[doctor]  Yeah, that's...
[patient]  I feel really bad.
[doctor]  Yeah, that's pretty high are you taking your medications or you missing some doses?
[patient]  I don't know I might miss one now, but I try to take them all time.
[doctor]  Yeah, yeah, you really need to take them very consistently. Now you also said you were watching your diet. Did you did you have some slips with that you said your ankles were swelling?
[patient]  No, I do I like to like to eat.
[doctor]  Are you eating a lot of salty foods and pizza or?
[patient]  I like potato chips.
[doctor]  Yeah
[patient]  I like the salt and vinegar potato chips, they're really good so.
[doctor]  Well, so do you go out to eat a lot or do you where you wear where are you eating those potato chips or is that just the home snacking or?
[patient]  That's home-snacking. I buy that other the brand name salt and VINDITive because brand won't taste real good but that the brand name's really taste good.
[doctor]  Oh
[patient]  So I eat those probably every day.
[doctor]  Goodness, while you know you we need to probably stop eating those now.
[patient]  Yeah, well I hate to hate to give those up, but I guess I might have to.
[doctor]  Well, since you've been in the hospital and they've helped you out with some with all that how are you feeling now?
[patient]  While I'm doing better.
[doctor]  3330 where 42 47 47 8 47 48 angry get nylon got slip posting Joshua if
[patient]  I don't have quite as much shortness of breath. I think maybe getting up and walking a little more is helping.
[doctor]  and they gave you a water pill and is that is that helping is that making you peel out.
[patient]  Yeah, I have almost incontinence so.
[doctor]  Goodness.
[patient]  Yes, that's not very pleasant at all.
[doctor]  And so they added another blood pressure medication. Also, how are you doing with that? Are you feeling a little bit better?
[patient]  Yeah, I think so.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  If I can remember to take the pills.
[doctor]  Yeah
[patient]  That seems to be a sticky point.
[doctor]  While IA pillbox or maybe setting an alarm on your phone might really help.
[patient]  Okay, I'll give that a try anything that will help.
[doctor]  Yeah, okay, well that's good to hear. So now have you bought a blood pressure cuff to have it home now?
[patient]  Yes, I already had one, but I very failed if I ever used it.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  But
[doctor]  Got it!
[patient]  I'll try to use it every day now.
[doctor]  Okay, and you might even just keep a log of what your blood pressures are. And when it's up think about you know what you've eaten if you've done something different because that may help you to figure out what you need to cut back on or how you might need to change your eating habits a little bit so.
[patient]  Okay, okay.
[doctor]  Have you been short of breath or any problem sleeping since you've been home?
[patient]  No, I've been sleeping like a log.
[doctor]  Okay, good. Alright, have you had any chest pain?
[patient]  No note chest pain.

So your vital signs, your blood pressure looks pretty good today at 128 over 70 to your temperature is 98. 7 and your heart rate is 72. Your respirations are 18. Your oxygen saturation looks pretty good at 96% okay. Now on your neck exam, there is no jugular venous distension on your heart exam. I appreciate a 2 over 6 systolic ejection murmur, which I've heard before. And so it's stable and your lungs are clear bilaterally and your lower extremities show just trace a demon. Now, now we since we did the echo cardiogram. I reviewed those results and it does show a preserved. Yeah, of 55% abnormal diastolic filling and mild to moderate mitral regurgitation. So let me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan. So for your first problem for your congestive heart failure, it sounds like this was caused by dietary and discretion and some uncontrolled hypertension. So I want you to continue on your Bumex 2 milligrams once daily continue to watch your diet and avoid salty foods might try keeping that log we talked about with your blood pressures. And what you've eaten if your blood pressure seems a little high also way yourself daily and call me if you gain 3 pounds in two days okay.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  And I also want you to see a nutritionist to give you some education about what foods you can eat okay now for your second problem for I know this sounds like this is just for you and so for your second problem for your hypertension I want you to continue on the COSAR 100 milligrams daily continue on the norvask 5 milligrams once daily also And I'm going to order a renal artery ultrasound just to be sure where not missing anything and then like maybe you know some renal artery stenosis or something and so so for your third problem for your kidney disease I want to get some more labs to make sure you tolerate this the new medications and then I'll see you again in three months do you have any questions
[patient]  No, I don't think so not today.

aci,ACI070,"[doctor]  Hi Virginia, how are you today? What brings you in?
[patient]  I'm doing all right. I started seeing this new PCP last year and you know, she's been doing a lot of changes to my medication and making sure everything is up to date and she might notice that my blood pressure has been quite high. So she added to medications, but and but you know, I've been taking them. I've been really good and I before I wasn't, but now I am and we're still having a hard time controlling my blood pressure. So she thought it would be a good idea for me to see you especially since she noted some of my last blood work. She said something about my kidneys.
[doctor]  Okay, yes so okay, let's before I dive into a lot of that tell me a little bit about how you've been feeling.
[patient]  I would say you know most of the days I feel fine, I'm still busy at work. I definitely can tell though my blood pressure is high.
[doctor]  Okay, you measure it at home, you measure your blood pressure at home.
[patient]  Yeah, I should want to get a blood pressure cuff, so I did start getting checking my blood pressures probably like a few times a week.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  And so then I noticed that it has been getting higher the other day was even as high as 170 over 90.
[doctor]  Wow.
[patient]  So I did call my PCP and she increased the meds again.
[doctor]  Okay, now I just have a couple questions about that are you using an electronic blood pressure recorder or do you have somebody help you at home?
[patient]  Yes, I have an electronic one and an electronic arm one.
[doctor]  Okay, okay, yeah, that's good, that's good. And have you ever tried to go to CVS at all?
[patient]  Yeah, I do, but I've noticed like since the pandemic, I don't see the blood pressures anymore.
[doctor]  Okay, okay, I, I thought the one down on Main Street, they I thought they just brought that one back so.
[patient]  today.
[doctor]  Yeah
[patient]  That's good to know.
[doctor]  You may want to check that, but okay, so that's good, but I what I'd like you to do with that is I'd like you to keep a record of them for me for my next visit with you. So let's talk a little bit about your diet, tell me how how is your diet, what are the what kind of foods do you like, what do you eat normally?
[patient]  Already won the honest answer.
[doctor]  Well, yeah, that would be better.
[patient]  So I really know with everything going on I really been trying to get better but I mean during football season it's really difficult I really love watching my games so I have a lot of pizza wings of like I said I've been trying to cut down especially on days where there's no games but it probably could be better.
[doctor]  Okay, I think we all can say that, but I do want to just say I don't know that if you've tried it or not, but there's a new restaurant down on 5th Street and it is nothing but solids. And I know when I heard this, I was like, okay, yeah, it's just another these solids are absolutely amazing. So if you ever get a chance, yeah, if you ever get a chance, try try that. I mean, I think you would enjoy them because they're solids that they make are just out. Unbelievable. So let me go ahead and I just have a few more questions and I'm going to just ask these in an order and you just tell me and then we will come back and talk about them. Do you have any headaches?
[patient]  Really just when my blood pressure gets really high, I have some mild headaches, but otherwise, I don't have it on a regular basis.
[doctor]  Okay, what about chest pain?
[patient]  No chest pain.
[doctor]  shortness of breath.
[patient]  No shortness of breath.
[doctor]  even with exertion.
[patient]  even with exertion.
[doctor]  Okay, do you have any swelling in your lower extremities at all that you noticed?
[patient]  Not if I'm on my feet for a long time, I'll notice a little bit of swelling, but otherwise no.
[doctor]  Okay, and then a couple other family history questions. Anybody in the family have kidney disease or significant high blood pressure?
[patient]  Both my parents do have high blood pressure and one of them did have kidney disease.
[doctor]  Okay, okay. And in the the form that you filled out when you came in it says that you are on 10 milligrams of norbask daily and Carved Isle-A-L, 25 milligrams twice a day, is those the medicines you're on.
[patient]  Yes, I was also on my CinePro before, but with the adjustments, yeah, those are the ones I'm on.
[doctor]  Okay, and so here's where I think we are going to go do you take any non-steroidal like Advil or Motrin or leave?
[patient]  It just wants in a while for my like any knee pain or back pain that I have, but again not like every day.
[doctor]  Okay, and then lastly, what kind of alcohol intake do you have you know do you consider how many drinks a week is really what I'm looking for?
[patient]  I'll have a couple of beers during the week and like one or two on the weekends.
[doctor]  Okay, okay, so let me do a quick physical examination. So I looked at your vitals when you came in today and your blood pressure, it's still high, it's 169 over 70 for your heart rate, was 88, and your oxygenation was 98%. So those are all fairly good except that blood pressures a little higher than we'd like to see now. When I look at your neck, I don't see any jugular vein distension and I'm going to listen. Here real quick, no, I don't hear any carotid brewed going to listen to your lungs, okay, your lungs are clear. And let me listen quickly to your heart, I do hear that a two over six systolic ejection murmur. And we're going to have to take a little bit look extra look at that. That's when I can hear an extra sound when I'm listening to your heart. And you do have a small amount of one plus pitting a Dima bilaterally now I did. So you do have that your diagnosis is uncontrolled hypertension you know, and I think you're aware that that's what you're you're physicians been treating you for and most of the time this cause is is the cause of this is multifactorial it's not that there is just one thing causing it so we may need to be changing your medicine around and I'm going to talk to your doctor. But first thing before we make any more medication changes I want to order some tests first to rule out if there is any specific cause for this so first order will be a renal artery ultrasound. And what I'm looking for there is that there is no areas of areas of narrowing into the blood vessels of your kidneys that would be the cause of your hypertension in addition to that I'm going to order a you get another urine collection some morning El Dostro and levels raining levels and a 24 hour urine and these things can really show me if there is any problems with your adrenal glands again this is a lot of big words. But you know I might I'll write this all out for you I want you to decrease your alcohol I know you like those beers but let's bring it down to maybe one a week or two a week just to get those down lower and then your salt intake you need to be very judicious about decreasing that salt intake I'm going to give you a referral to a nutritionist to discuss those changes for that you need and then they will help you get that cleared up and then finally stop taking any non-steroidal medicines such as your advelle or motrin the only thing I really want to want you taking is Tylenol for any pain right now I am going to prescribe one medicine and that's Cardura for milligrams and I want you to take that once a day and that's good to see if that can help us with your blood pressure and then finally three weeks I'd like you to return I want you to record all of your blood pressures that you take over the next three weeks and bring them into the office but most importantly if you can try to take them at the same time every day that would be beneficial for me any questions for me.
[patient]  Now I just, it's a lot, so I'm hoping this will work and this will get under control.
[doctor]  Yeah, I think you know this, we'll be you know this, we're going to spend some time together. So I'm glad to have you as a patient, but you know we got to try to get this under control, and I'm going to be talking to your PCP just to let them know that you know what my plans are, and we'll stay real and sync on treating this as we move forward. Does that sound like a plan?
[patient]  That sounds good, thank you.
[doctor]  Okay, take care I'll talk to you later.

aci,ACI071,"[doctor]  Good morning, Carolyn. How are you?
[patient]  I'm doing alright other than this ankle pain I've been having.
[doctor]  So, I see here that you hurt your right ankle, can you tell me what happened?
[patient]  Yeah, so yesterday I was gonna take out the trash and it was quite icy. I thought I was doing okay job and I just slipped and then fell and I'm pretty sure I heard a pop.
[doctor]  Okay, and you said this happened yesterday correct.
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  Okay, and have you been able to walk on it at all?
[patient]  No, I was so initially when I first fell, I was unable to walk it on it at all. I had a friend that was visiting and so she heard me fall. So she helped me inside now today. I have been able to put a little bit more weight on it, but I'm still limping.
[doctor]  Okay, and then what have you been doing for your foot or ankle pain since that happened?
[patient]  So I like iced it last night and kept it elevated and I also took some ibuprofen last night and This morning before coming in today
[doctor]  Okay, and can you rate your pain for me?
[patient]  I would say right now it's like a 4 out of 10.
[doctor]  Okay, and does the ibuprofen help with that pain?
[patient]  It does it does help with the pain.
[doctor]  Okay, and when you take your ibuprofen, what can you what's your pain level then?
[patient]  So this, so what did I just say for?
[doctor]  Yes ma'am.
[patient]  For out of 10, so 4 out of 10 is with ibuprofen.
[doctor]  It's with ibuprofen, okay. What's your pain level without then?
[patient]  I would say probably six.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  I'm sorry it's 6 out of 10 without ibuprofen and it goes down to like a 1 with ibuprofen.
[doctor]  Okay, alright that sounds good have you ever injured that foot and ankle before?
[patient]  You know, I've had a lot of injuries to my ankle, but I've never hurt this ankle before. I just realized an error.
[doctor]  Okay, you know, and I see here that you have a history of playing sports looks like you played soccer in college and then played a little bit of an inner marrow soccer now.
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  I'm guessing you probably haven't been able to do that since you hurt your ankle.
[patient]  No, I have not been.
[doctor]  So did you hear about the new Major League soccer stadium and team that's coming to tell they opened in the this year? Actually, they built the stadium. Have you been down there yet?
[patient]  Now I have to get there.
[doctor]  Yeah, we are all excited it's going to be a good time. I'll have you experienced any numbness or tingling in that right foot.
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Okay, so if it's okay with you, I would like to do a quick physical exam. Your vitals look good. And everything there looks okay. Now I'm going to do a focused exam on your right ankle. I do appreciate some echinmosis or bruising over the lateral maliolis maliolis associated with some edema or swelling of that area. You are positive for tenderness to palpation of the anterior lateral soft tissue. And now I don't appreciate any. Lactity on anterior drawer and inversion stress, there is no bony tenderness on. Palpation to that foot or ankle area. Now on neurovascular exam of your right foot, you have brisk capillary refill of less than three seconds strong dorsalus pedispulse. And your sensation is intact to light touch. And all of that is consistent with what's present on your left side as well. So I did review the results of your of your x-ray, the x-ray of your right ankle showed no fracture, which is a good thing. So now let me talk to you a little bit about my assessment and plan. So for the first problem of right ankle pain, your symptoms are consistent with a right ankle sprain or I'm sorry right ankle sprain of your lateral ligament complex. More specifically your anterior talofibular ligament. Now this ligament's on the outside of your ankle ankle, which got stretched when you fell the best treatment at this time for your sprain is to keep your leg elevated when you're seated. And let's continue to ice okay, you're going to be given an air cast, which is going to help stabilize that ankle and eye. Also going to prescribe some crutches because I want you to stay off that leg and start walking on it stay off your leg for now. And then in a couple of days start walking on it as tolerated. Do you have any questions or concerns for me?
[patient]  So how long do you think it'll take to heal?
[doctor]  So your symptoms should significantly improve over a few weeks, but I'd like to follow up with you and see how you're doing. Let's say I'll see you again in 14 days now. I do want you to go ahead and continue to take NSAIDS or IB Profen as needed to help with any pain and that's also going to help reduce that inflammation and swelling. Okay.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Alright, I will see you again in two weeks, Carolyn.
[patient]  Great thank you.
[doctor]  You're welcome.","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Right ankle pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Carolyn Jones is a pleasant 38-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for evaluation of right ankle pain.

The patient sustained an injury to her right ankle when she slipped and fell on ice while taking her garbage out yesterday. This was her first right ankle injury. She believes she heard a pop at the time, but denies any associated numbness or tingling. Initially, she was unable to bear weight on the ankle and required help getting inside; however, she is now able to slightly bear weight but ambulates with an antalgic gait. Ice, elevation, and ibuprofen have been helpful at reducing her pain. She rates her current pain as 4/10, her pain without medication as 6/10, and her pain with medication as 1/10.

Of note, the patient participates in an intramural soccer league but has not been able to play since this injury.

MEDICAL HISTORY

The patient reports that she has had several ankle injuries in the past. This is her first right ankle injury.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient reports that she has a history of playing sports. She played soccer in college and is now in an intramural soccer league.

MEDICATIONS

The patient reports that she has been taking ibuprofen.

PHYSICAL EXAM

GAIT: antalgic gait
CV: Brisk capillary refill to less than 3 seconds. Strong dorsalis pedis pulse.
NEURO: Sensation in the right ankle is intact to light touch distally.
MSK: Examination of the right ankle: Ecchymosis over the lateral malleolus associated with trace edema in that area. Tenderness to palpation over the anterolateral soft tissue. No laxity on anterior drawer testing or inversion stress testing. No bony tenderness on palpation of the foot or ankle area. Findings are consistent bilaterally.

RESULTS

X-ray images of the right ankle were obtained and reviewed today. These reveal no evidence of fracture.

ASSESSMENT

Lateral ligament complex sprain, Right ankle.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, her symptoms are consistent with a right ankle sprain of the lateral ligament complex, more specifically the anterior talofibular ligament. We had a lengthy discussion regarding the nature of this injury and the course of treatment. I advised her to keep her leg elevated when she is seated and continue to ice her ankle. She should also continue taking ibuprofen as-needed for pain and inflammation management. She will be placed in an Aircast to help stabilize her ankle, and I am going to order crutches so she can remain non-weight-bearing for the next couple of days. At that point, she can start bearing weight on the ankle as tolerated.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up in 2 weeks."
aci,ACI073,"[doctor]  Hey Dylan, what's going on? So I lift quite a bit of weights I try to stay in shape as much as I can. I'm not like normal people. I lift heavy weights and my elbow is extremely sore, which elbow is it?
[patient]  Actually it's both my elbows, but my right elbow is hurting me the most.
[doctor]  Okay, and you said you lived a lot of weights.
[patient]  MM
[doctor]  Did you play any sports when you were younger?
[patient]  Not anything you can think of primarily it was basketball, baseball, and football.
[doctor]  Okay, and did your elbows hurt at that time? Or is this say a new injury?
[patient]  It's new.
[doctor]  When did it start?
[patient]  Probably a year and a half ago.
[doctor]  Okay on both elbows about a year and a half ago.
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  Okay, have you taken anything for the pain?
[patient]  IB Profin 800mg 3 times a day.
[doctor]  Okay, and does anything make it better or worse?
[patient]  The more I use my hands or my arms the more it hurts.
[doctor]  Okay, have you tried icing?
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  Does that give you any relief?
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  All right, is it the inside or outside of your elbows?
[patient]  inside.
[doctor]  Inside, okay, let's just do a quick physical exam. Here I'll take a look at your right elbow first.
[patient]  MM
[doctor]  If I bend it this way up, does it hurt? It's your left, does that hurt?
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  How about this?
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  Okay, so pain with both flexion and extension.
[patient]  MM
[doctor]  Looks like you have a little bit of limited range of motion on extension, not on flexion, though you said it hurts right here on the inside of your elbow.
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  Okay, so pain on the medial side with palpation.
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  Alright, how about the outside?
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  No pain with palpation outside of the elbow. You have to have normal sensation in your fingers.
[patient]  I think so.
[doctor]  Yeah
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  Okay, great.
[patient]  Good to go!
[doctor]  Sensation is normal to the touch.
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  Pulse is equal in all extremities how about the left elbow, same thing, if I bend it this way does that hurt.
[patient]  Not as much.
[doctor]  How about this way?
[patient]  Not as much.
[doctor]  Alright, so a little bit of pain on flexion and extension a little bit of limited range of motion on extension of the arm how about if you twist like you're opening a door.
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  Okay, so some pain with torsion and twisting supination, what about pronation?
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  No pain with pronation on the right side.
[patient]  MM
[doctor]  Same thing on the left.
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  Pain with supination, no pain with pronation.
[patient]  Correct.
[doctor]  Alright, so Dylan, it took some x-rays coming and looks like you don't have any any fractures or any bony misalignment, which I expect with this kind of injury. I do think that what you have is medial epicon delitis, which is.
[patient]  Is that golfers elbow?
[doctor]  Yes, same thing have you been golfing a lot?
[patient]  Well not in the past year and a half I've had this for a long time.
[doctor]  Okay, also known as Pictures Elbow.
[patient]  while I haven't been pitching either.
[doctor]  Well in any case what I'm going to have to do is I'm going to send you up for MRI to take another look at this.
[patient]  MM
[doctor]  That will be our next step, so we'll get you scheduled for the MRI, probably get you in pretty quick here since we're a private practice.
[patient]  Thank God.
[doctor]  Yeah, and once you get the MRI, I'll know a little bit more what I'd like to do is something called a whole blood transfusion have you heard of that before?
[patient]  No, please tell me to remind me.
[doctor]  Yeah, it should help with the healing of your elbow. It's just a procedure we'll stick a needle in your elbow.
[patient]  You do a stick needle in my elbow.
[doctor]  and help with some of the healing of your elbow.
[patient]  So it's kind of like dry, needling then.
[doctor]  No.
[patient]  Not all.
[doctor]  What is it?
[patient]  Is it that that thing where you take the blood out of, like, same on my thigh?
[doctor]  Hmm.
[patient]  and then you literally inject it into my tendon.
[doctor]  Yes.
[patient]  that it activates the healing.
[doctor]  Yeah, that's exactly what it is.
[patient]  Interesting cool.
[doctor]  Yeah
[patient]  Maybe I have heard about that.
[doctor]  We've had some really good responses from other patients on it, so hopefully I mean that should be a good solution for you since you've been having issues with this.
[patient]  I'm excited.
[doctor]  Yeah, and we can hopefully get you scheduled for that in the next couple of weeks. It's not not a major procedure. And you should heal in the next two weeks, so that won't be a problem, especially considering that you're expecting a newborn, soon we want to make sure you're all healed for that.
[patient]  Why didn't even say that?
[doctor]  I read it in your chart.
[patient]  Menu doctors are good.
[doctor]  Yeah, anything else going on today?
[patient]  Just trying to figure out how you're doing.
[doctor]  Very good, thank you.
[patient]  You're welcome.
[doctor]  Nice to see you.
[patient]  You have a good day.","CHIEF COMPLAINT

aci,ACI074,"[doctor]  So Barbara, I know you are here for some itchy scalp pain. Can you tell me a little bit about how you're doing?
[patient]  It's still quite a problem. You know something I've been suffering with for so long now. It's still quite itchy and it's really embarrassing too because I'll have dandruff so much like all over me. But I just can't stop itching.
[doctor]  Okay, when did you first notice this?
[patient]  I want to say it's been a while, but probably worsening in the past like six months or so.
[doctor]  Okay, okay. And have you seen ever noticed any rashes either when it first started or intermittently anywhere else?
[patient]  Well my body know not really.
[doctor]  Okay, okay, just mainly up underneath you're on your scalp there. Uh, and I can see that man that looks really itchy and scaly have you dyed your hair recently, or used any other chemicals, you know, like a new hair spray or gel.
[patient]  Nothing new, I mean I do dye my hair, but I've been doing that for years now, but otherwise I don't really use a lot of products in my hair.
[doctor]  Yeah, I know it's funny you say that because I keep saying I earned this gray hair and I'm going to keep it. So you have you tried any over the counter treatments I know there is a lot out of there something you know like a T gel or any of those other have those helped.
[patient]  Yeah, I did that I did head and shoulders. I even tried some castor oil and but none of them really seem to be helping.
[doctor]  Okay, okay, let's talk about some other symptoms any joint pain fever weight loss.
[patient]  Not that I can recall, I've been pretty good otherwise.
[doctor]  Okay, good. And going back, you know, to your grandparents has anybody else in the family had similar symptoms that you're aware of.
[patient]  No, well, maybe my sister.
[doctor]  Maybe your sister okay.
[patient]  Yeah, maybe my sister, I mean I know she'll as no one has as bad as I do, but she does report like just having a dry scout.
[doctor]  Okay, okay. Now, you know, a lot of times we can see this with, you know, high levels of stress has there been any new mental or emotional stressors at work or at home?
[patient]  Not really, I mean it's basically the same things.
[doctor]  Okay, yeah, IA, we have a lot of that, yes. So let me go ahead and then look at this a little closer here. The first off, I want to tell you the vital signs that the my assistant took when you came in your blood pressure is 130 over 68. Your heart rate was 98 and your respiratory rate was 18. So those all look good and appear normal and your temperature was 97. Seven, and that is all normal now. When I look at your scalp here, I do notice that you have demarcated, scaly, arithematous plaques. And that's just kind of explaining technically what's going on those patches. And they're there in a patchy format. They're diffusely present across the back of your skull. And that's probably why you see all that, that white dander you know on your, on your clothes as you go through the day. Now let me talk a little bit about my impression and plan, I think that you have a scalp psoriasis. And let's in here is my thoughts on that what I would like you to use is to use chlobetisol that's a zero, zero five percent solution. And I want you to use that twice daily on the affected areas of your scalp. So you're just going to put this on and just kind of gently rub it. And now I know to do it twice daily is going to be difficult. But if you can do it first thing in the morning when you get up and then before you go to bed, you know, get a shower. And before you go to bed that will be great. I want you to continue to use T gel shampoo that you listed when you first came in. That's a very good solution. Shampoo for that. And that will help with controlling a lot of this now. There is no cure for this. Unfortunately, and flare ups can be unpredictable. But we see that you know not we don't have a great finger on what causes the flare ups. But I'm going to give you some steroids that will help. And we're going to have to manage that on an ongoing basis. But when you get to get a flare up, I want you to be using these flare steroid that I give you as we go through that. And then I want to see you back here in three months or sooner if it gets significantly worse. Do you have any questions for me?
[patient]  No, okay. So I'll just use that steroid solution and then just as needed if it's really bad, but then otherwise just use the T gel.
[doctor]  Yeah, I want it's exactly what I want you to do. I want you to use that that solution twice daily when you get that flare. But then other than that just continue to use that T gel shampoo.
[patient]  All right.
[doctor]  Okay, I'm gonna have my nurse come in and get you discharged, but either we will see you again in three months or and again, please if it gets worse, please don't hesitate to call me and come in sooner.
[patient]  All right, perfect, thank you.

[doctor]  For your blood sugar check, are you checking that or not really?
[patient]  I did a couple of weeks ago.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  And it was about it. I think about 230 it was okay.
[doctor]  Okay, so your hemoglobin A1c last time was seven. Five, and we had talked about, you know, trying to improve your diet, we had talked about, you know, we want to avoid going to insulin, but it sounds like it's been a challenge to kind of control the diet, and also your blood sugars have been running a little bit high.
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  Okay, all right.
[patient]  Yep, it's been a challenge.
[doctor]  All right, in any nausea vomiting or diarrhea, or anything like that are you paying a whole lot, or anything like that know?
[patient]  You have feeling like crazy.
[doctor]  Okay, all right.
[patient]  Can't figure out why because I'm not drinking very much.

[doctor]  Okay, all right, no weakness or numbness in your legs right now.
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  So let me examine you now. Gloria, I'm going to go ahead and do an exam and let's pretend I did my exam. I'm just going to verbalize some of my findings just so I can record this and put it into my my into my chart. So, Neck exam, you do have a little bit of swelling in your neck, a little bit of JVD. No broods your lung exam. You have some crackles in both bases and some rals that I can hear and there are a little bit of intermittent wheezing as well on your heart exam. You have a two over six systolic ejection murmur. You've had that in the past otherwise regular rate and rhythm it doesn't feel a regular your belly exam. Your belly is slightly distended. There's no tenderness or guarding or anything like that. So that doesn't that looks pretty good on your leg exam. You do have some one plus pitting a dima or actually almost one and a half plus pitting a dima in your both of your ankles. No calf tenderness negative home in sign. That means no blood. Clots otherwise neurologic exam is normal the rest of. Your exam is normal. So what does this all mean? So let me explain that so for the first problem the shortness of breath. You know, I think you have an exacerbation of your congestive heart failure. What I'd like to do is increase your dose of lasix from 20 milligrams to 60 milligrams for the next four days. I'm going to have you check your weights every day and also I'm going to go ahead and have you use your albuterol and atroventway. Had given you some inhalers in the past, I can give you another refill if you need to help with that. Some of the breathing that you're having the shortness of breath. So I'd like to get some of this fluid off. You have you check your weights daily. We'll have you increase your dose of lasix. We'll have you use a breathing treatments and see if that helps your shortness of breath. I'd like to have you come back in about a couple days. Actually, I want to see how you're doing and if it doesn't get better, we may have to increase the dose or send. You to the hospital. Okay.
[patient]  I don't want to go to the hospital doctor.
[doctor]  Yes, so let's try to let's try to use the lasix. And let's try to let's try to use the breathing treatments and do that for the second problem, the diabetes that we just talked about. I like to go ahead and order another blood test, another hemoglobin. A1c, I think we need to your blood sugars, have been running a little bit high in the past and we've had a hard time. But it's been a while since we checked your last one, so I want to check another one today to see where we are and when we have you come back in a couple days, we should have the results back. We can then adjust your metformin or we may have to adjust some of you know, add a different medication at that point. But right now I'm going to order some blood tests. We'll have you come back in a couple of days and then we can reassess at that point, okay.
[patient]  So I had a piece of cake before I came in here. Is that going to affect the lab work?
[doctor]  Yeah, we'll probably do a fasting blood sugar. We'll order the hemoglobin, a one-sea that shouldn't be actually matter because that checks long term. But if we need your blood sugar, maybe elevated today, I wouldn't be surprised all right. And I forgot to examine your back, by the way. So on your back exam, you do have some tenderness in the parsed vinyl areas of your back and the in the lower back, mostly no midline tenderness you have. Good reflexes. So I think this is all muscular pain right now for your back pain. I'm going to go ahead and put you on some nappersine and some flexoril, which is a muscle relaxer. I'm going to give you some exercises you can do to help you get off the couch. It'll also help your blood sugar. And why don't we have you if that doesn't work through the pain medicine and the physical we can start physical therapy and see if that helps okay.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Any questions about that?
[patient]  I don't think so which color pills.
[doctor]  I think it's a white pill and it's round.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  about this big.
[patient]  Alright, sounds good.
[doctor]  Anything else, Gloria?
[patient]  No, that's it.

aci,ACI076,"[doctor]  Good morning, Julie. How are you doing this morning?
[patient]  I've been better my primary care doctor wanted me to see you because of this knee pain that I've been having for about six months now.
[doctor]  Okay, and do you remember what caused the pain initially?
[patient]  Honestly, I don't I can't think of any time if I fell or like I've really been trying to think and I can't really think of any specific event.
[doctor]  Okay now it says here that it's in both knees is that correct.
[patient]  Yes, both my knees.
[doctor]  Okay, kind of try. Let's let's try describing the pain for me, please.
[patient]  Yeah, it kind of feels like it's like right behind my kneecaps.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  And it's like a deep, achy pain.
[doctor]  A deep achy pain, okay. What kind of activities makes the pain feel worse?
[patient]  Let's see, so anytime, so if I'm sitting in my desk and I get up, I have a lot of pain. So anytime from like standing up from sitting for a while or even going up and down the stairs.
[doctor]  Okay, so you work from home.
[patient]  I do.
[doctor]  Okay, okay, so there is a lot of desk setting at home is your office upstairs or is it I mean do you have to go up or downstairs to get to it?
[patient]  Nope, well first thing in the morning, but otherwise it's downstairs.
[doctor]  Okay, okay. How do you like working from home?
[patient]  You know it has its plus and minuses.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  I like it though, but I like my commute.
[doctor]  Yeah
[patient]  I love it.
[doctor]  And the parking I'm sure the parking is.
[patient]  and the parking is great.
[doctor]  Yeah, I know if I could do telehealth visits all day long, I would be totally happy with that. Yeah. And just set it home and do those so you mentioned, is there anything that makes that pain feel better?
[patient]  Usually I have to like if I feel that pain and then I just it does get better.
[doctor]  Okay, now you mentioned earlier that you tried some things in the past, what have what are they, and did they work at all?
[patient]  Yeah, I've done some ibuprofen or leave some time some Tylenol and that does help.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  It takes the edge off.
[doctor]  Okay, but you're never really pain free. Is that what I hear you saying?
[patient]  not really unless I'm like really just resting which I hate to do, but otherwise any type of movement, especially from sitting at causes pain.
[doctor]  Okay, so are you active other than going up and down the steps to your office?
[patient]  Very I'm a big runner, I love to run, I run about 5 to 6 miles a day. But with this knee width, with these knee pain that I've been having, it's I barely can even do half a mile.
[doctor]  Yeah, you know what that's, that's I am a biker, and I know that once you get that into your, you know you have loved doing that activity. It's so frustrating when you can't, it's almost like a, it's almost like a dry, it almost becomes a drug when you get up.
[patient]  Exactly.
[doctor]  Yeah
[patient]  It's
[doctor]  Okay, so have you noticed any redness or swelling in your knees?
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Okay, and have you ever injured your knees before?
[patient]  You know despite how active I am I you know I've never.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  injured or broken a bone.
[doctor]  Okay great, so let's go ahead and do AI just want to take a look here. I reviewed your vitals and overall they look good. Your blood pressure is 120 over 70 or your heart rate is 60 and your respiratory rate is 14. Those are all phenomenal numbers as I listen to your heart. It is at a regular and a slower rate, but I don't hear any extra sounds. So there's no murmurs as we go through that now on musculoskeletal exam. You have a normal gate. I watch to you know kind of walk in. Here this morning your strength. I just want to check it when I go ahead and I want you to move your leg. Okay your muscle strength is as good you do have a three out of five for abduction of your legs bilaterally and that's you know kind of bringing your legs in the remainder of your muscle strength for your lower extremities is a five out of five. Now let me focus specifically on your knee examination. I don't see any redness or echinosis or warmth of the skin and those are big words you know I don't see any bruising or or that redness. There is no effusion that's just like a fluid underneath the knee. I don't appreciate that any at all you do seem to have some tenderness when I palpate and you do have a positive patella grine test when you stood up I could feel that as we went through there you did say you had that knee pain with squatting but your lockman your anterior and posterior drawer and McMurray test are all negative bilaterally. Neurologically and you're you're lower extremities your patella and your Achilles reflex are symmetrical and that's good. So I did review the x-rays of both your knees which shows no fractures or osteoarthritis. So based on what you told me and reviewing the MRI that you had done before you came in your symptoms are consistent with patella femoral pain syndrome and this is a really common condition that we see that causes knee knee pain especially in really active young people. That's probably why I don't get it when I'm riding my bike forever and ever now this condition has to do with the way your knee cap moves across along the groove of your thigh bone your femur. So for pain I want you to continue to take the ibuprofen or any other anti-inflammatories you know a leave or any of those as you need it to help with the pain. Now I am going to recommend physical therapy while they will show you a number of lower extremity exercises this is probably one of the best things that you can do and this will help increase your lower extremities strength your mobility and correct any incorrect running mechanics that you might have do have any questions for me.
[patient]  So will I be able to run again?
[doctor]  Absolutely my goal is to get you out there and maybe we can cross pads on the bike trail some day you're gonna have to take it a little bit easy for now but we're gonna get you back and once we do that I think you will be really pleased is there anything else.
[patient]  No, I think that's it.
[doctor]  Okay, have a great day.
[patient]  Okay, you too.
[doctor]  Thank you.
[patient]  Bye.","CHIEF COMPLAINT

aci,ACI080,"[doctor]  Hey Gene, how are you doing today?
[patient]  I'm doing alright aside from this foot pain that I have.
[doctor]  So I see here that you looks like you hurt your left foot here where you were playing soccer. Can you tell me a little bit more about what happened?
[patient]  Yeah, so yeah, I was playing a soccer game yesterday and I was trying to steal the ball from another player and she ended up falling directly on my right foot and I don't know I mean I was trying to get around her and my body ended up twisting around her and then I accidentally fell to pain in my foot.
[doctor]  Okay, so have you ever hurt your left foot before?
[patient]  No, I've had a lot of injuries in soccer, but never injured this foot.
[doctor]  Okay, and then so after the fall and the entanglement with the other player were you able to continue playing.
[patient]  No, I had to stop playing right away and actually being helped off the field.
[doctor]  Well, okay. And what have you been doing for the pain since then?
[patient]  So I've been keeping it elevated icing at the trainer, wrapped it yesterday, and taking ibuprofen as well.
[doctor]  Okay, all right, so without any ibuprofen, can you tell me what your pain level is?
[patient]  With ibuprofen, I would say my pain is a 3.
[doctor]  Okay, and then without your ibuprofen, can you tell me what your pain level is?
[patient]  Like a 7-8.
[doctor]  Okay, so how long have you been playing soccer?
[patient]  Really since I was like 4-5 I've been playing a long time.
[doctor]  Well, that's cool. Yeah, we are our youngest daughter. She is almost 16 and she plays the Intermarial Soccer League. They are down at the Rec Center did. Is that where you started playing or did you guys? Did you start playing somewhere else?
[patient]  Yeah, just like this local town leak, I started playing that way, and then played all throughout school.
[doctor]  That's...
[patient]  High school teams.
[doctor]  That's awesome. So just out of curiosity with the left foot, have you experienced anything like numbness or tingling or any strange sensation?
[patient]  No, I have not.
[doctor]  Okay, now if it's okay with you, I would like to do a quick physical exam. I reviewed your vitals and everything looks good blood pressure was 118 over 72 heart rate, was 58 respiratory rate, was 14 UR A-FB, and you had an O2 saturation of 99% on room air on your heart exam, your regular of rate, and rhythm don't appreciate any clicks, rubs, or murmurs, no ectopic beats, noted thereon. Oskultation listening to your lungs lungs are clear and equal. Bilaterally, so you're moving good air, I'd like to do a focus foot exam on your left foot. So I do see some bruising on the bottom of your foot, and on the top of your foot, as well now, there's associated swelling, and I do appreciate tenderness to palpation of your midfoot, and you are positive for the piano key test on a neurovascular exam of your left foot, you have a brisk capillary refill of less than three second store-salis. Petus pulse is intact and strong, and you do have motor and sensation. That it's intact to light touch now, I would like to do a review of the diagnostic imaging that you had before you came in, so I do notice a subtle dorsal displacement of the base of the second metatarsal, with a three millimeter separation of the first and second metatarsal bases, and the presence of a bony fragment in the Liz-Frank joint space. So let me talk to you a little bit about my assessment, and plan now for the first. Concern of right foot pain, your right foot pain, is due to a Liz-Frank. Fracture, which is a fracture to one of your second metatarsal bones at the top of your foot, where the metatarsals meet your cuboids. Now there are ligaments at the top of your foot, so I'm going to be ordering an MRI to assess for injury to any of these ligaments now, based on your exam, and from what I'm seeing on your X-ray, your most likely going to need surgery of that foot, now the surgery will place the bones back in their proper. Position, and using plates and screws will hold them their while. They heal, and this is going to allow those bones and ligaments to heal properly. It is a day surgery, and you will be able to go home the same day, and then I'm going to have you follow up with me here in the clinic, you'll be in a cast, and you will need to use crutches, and you will not be able to use that left foot for about six to eight weeks now, after that six to eight weeks, you will gradually start walking on your foot based on how you tolerate it, and we'll see how you do at that point. So I do. Believe you're going to need surgery, I am recommending this, because there are significant complications to your foot if we do not do this poor bone and ligament healing can lead to losing the arch of your foot, and you're becoming flat footed, you also have a high likelihood of developing arthritis in that foot. So what I'm going to do, unfortunately, you'll be out the rest of the season, but we are going to get you fixed up and ready for next season if you're okay with all of this, I'm going to have the nurse come in and get you started on your paperwork, and then I will see you on Monday morning, and we will get your foot taken care of.
[patient]  All right, thank you.

We will see the patient on Monday, for surgery."
aci,ACI082,"[doctor]  Hi, Abigail, how are you today?
[patient]  Hello, hi nice to meet you. I'm undoing okay.
[doctor]  Good on Dr. Sanchez and I'm gonna go ahead and take a look I saw with your notes that you've been having some knee pain yes that's that's true you know it's been going on for while I like to run I do jogs I sign up for the 5k tack you know sometimes the marathon and I haven't been doing longer distances because...
[patient]  When I'm running on my right knee here, it just starts to ache and it's just at the point where I need your opinion.
[doctor]  Okay, okay, what have you done for it? So far, what makes it better? What makes it worse?
[patient]  Well, it used to be that when I run an ache and then I put ice on it and then it would be okay. So I do ice and ibuprofen.
[doctor]  Okay, okay. And did you see anybody for this before coming into the office here?
[patient]  Yeah, I doctor would is my primary care provider and I talked to him about it actually over the years and this last visit he said he referred me to you.
[doctor]  Okay, okay, good so ice and rest makes it feel better running and an activity makes it hurt a little bit more is that correct?
[patient]  Yeah, that's right.
[doctor]  Okay, do you have any family history of arthritis or any of those type of immune diseases?
[patient]  I'm trying to think no, I don't think so no.
[doctor]  Okay, and do you get as it is this primarily worse in the morning or does it is it just there all the time when it comes on?
[patient]  It actually is worse towards the end of the day.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  Once I'm on my feet, all day it starts to ache toward the afternoon.
[doctor]  Okay, so let's go ahead and I want to do a quick examination here, your blood pressure, and was 120 over 60, that's phenomenal. Your heart rate was 58, and you can tell that you're a runner with that, that level of a heart rate, and your respirations were 14. So all of that looked very good, there was no fever. When you came in, when I'm going to just quickly listen to your heart, and lungs, okay, those those sound good. But let me get lets focus here on your lower extremities, I'm I'm going to look at your left knee first, when I move your left knee, do you get any type of pain? Or is it just feel like normal? And it's always your pain's always isolated to the right.
[patient]  that feels that feels normal.
[doctor]  Okay, okay, so let me just want you to back up here in the stretcher a little bit more and I'm just going to do some movement of your knee any okay. So I want you to push your leg out against my hand. Does that hurt?
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Okay, and if you pull back, does that hurt a little bit?
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Okay, and I'm going to move it around. So when I look at the knee, there is no redness, there's no swelling, I can appreciate a small amount of effusion. And that means that there's a little bit of fluid under the knee or in that knee's joint space. And there is there is several reasons that could be now when I push on your knee, does it hurt more on the inside? Or does it hurt more on the outside here?
[patient]  So the right knee here hurts on the outside.
[doctor]  Okay, okay, and you've got a good pedal pull so you know you can feel that and when I touch your feet you don't have any numbness or tingling or anything like that.
[patient]  Noah
[doctor]  Okay, well, so what I want to tell you is that I think you have a knee sprain from overuse, and we see that sometimes in runners now, unfortunately, you're going to have to take some a little bit of time off of a back-to-running, but I don't think it will be that long until we can get you up and running again. Now, I review the x-rays that we did when you first came into the office here this morning, and the joint spaces of that right knee are well maintained. I don't see any evidence of any fracture, and when compared to the left knee, everything looks good. So I don't even see any signs of any arthritis that I would have been suspecting I would like you to stay on two Tylenol 500 milligrams and two ibuprofen 200 milligram tablets, and I want you to take that three times a day, and that's going to help with both the pain and the inflammation. I'm also going to order some physical therapy for your right knee and that physical therapy will help strengthen the lower extremities and make it give you a little bit of a balance, and some they'll be able to recommend good running exercises for you. I do want to follow up with you in two weeks and see if we're getting better. So let's know running for two weeks, and if we're improving, then we'll move on and probably start adding some additional activity. Does that sound like a plan?
[patient]  Yeah, that desire was curious. So I will lay off the running for now. Can I lift weights and do like my squats and in those type of exercises at the gym?
[doctor]  Yeah, absolutely. And those are good exercises, but I'd like you to get that first physical therapy appointment in. And they'll be able to talk with you on what the best exercises are for you to do.
[patient]  Okay, got it.
[doctor]  Any questions?
[patient]  No, I don't think so.
[doctor]  Okay, thank you Abigail and I'd like I said stop out at the desk and we'll make an appointment for two weeks.
[patient]  Okay thanks doctor.

[doctor]  Okay, that's good yet. It sounds like you have sensation there. So yeah, that that's really good. So let me do a quick physical exam on you. So I reviewed your vitals, your blood pressure was 120 over 80, which is good. Your heart rate, your SPO2 was 98%, which is good. That means you're getting all of your oxygen. And so let me go ahead and look at your ankle real quick. So when I press here, does that hurt?
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  Alright, what about here?
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  Okay, so looking at your ankle and your right ankle exam on the skin there is echinmosis. So you have that bruising which you can see of the lateral.
[patient]  Malielis
[doctor]  Malielis associated with swelling, there is tenderness to palpation of the anterior laterally in the soft tissue. There is no laxity on the anterior drawer, and in version stress, there is no bony tenderness on palpation of the foot on your neurovascular exam of your right foot, your capillary refill, is less than three seconds strong dorsalus pedispulse, and your sensation is intact to light touch. All right, so we did get in. X-ray of your ankle before you came in, and luckily it's there is no. Fractures no bony abnormalities, which is really good. So let me talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you. So for your right ankle pain, your symptoms, your symptoms are consistent with a right ankle sprain, have you sprained your ankle before? Most times people do the athletics play soccer, it happens every so often, but have you done that before?
[patient]  know what i think so
[doctor]  Okay, well, you're one of the lucky ones, some of my patients that play sports. They spray in their ankle, seems like every other week so good for you. So for that, that ankle spray, I just want to keep, I want you to keep your leg elevated when you're seated. And I want you to continue to isolate. You can isolate, say, five times a day for 20 minutes at a time, just to help that swelling go down. I'm going to give you an air cast to help you. Stabilize the ankle. So keep it from moving. And then I'll give you crutches. And so I want you to stay off that leg for about one to two days. And then you can start walking on it as tolerated, tolerated. So how does that sound?
[patient]  It's alright.
[doctor]  Alright, so, do you have any questions for me?
[patient]  You like how long do you think it's gonna take for me to heal?
[doctor]  I mean, it should take a couple of days. I mean, I think in a day or two you'll be able to walk on it, but still think it will be sore for the next couple of weeks. You know, your ankle sprain seems to be not the worst, but it's kind of, you know, medium grade ankle sprain. So as I would say about two to three weeks, you should be back to normal. You will see some of that bruising go away.
[patient]  Yeah, okay, can I get a doctor's note?
[doctor]  No, because you need to go back to work, because you work on the computer not running so.
[patient]  Fine.
[doctor]  Yeah, you can't get a doctor's note. So if you if I write a note, I'm going to tell your boss that you have to go to work.
[patient]  Okay thanks.
[doctor]  So I wouldn't do that, but yeah. But otherwise, if you continue to have pain after this week, if you feel like it's not getting better, please feel free to contact the office. And we can get you back in and possibly do an MRI if we no need to.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Alright.
[patient]  All right.
[doctor]  Anything else?
[patient]  No, that's it.
[doctor]  Alright, thanks.","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Right ankle pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Anna Diaz is a pleasant 31-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right ankle pain. The onset of her pain began when she slipped on a patch of ice while taking out the trash. She states that she heard a pop at the time of the injury. The patient reports that she was unable to ambulate on her right ankle initially after the injury; however, she is now able to bear some weight on her right ankle, but she is still limping. The patient rates her pain level as a 6 out of 10. Ms. Diaz describes her pain as constant and throbbing. She reports that her right ankle is warm to the touch. She denies any numbness or tingling in her right foot. The patient has been icing and elevating her right ankle while also utilizing ibuprofen last night and this morning, which did not provide her with any relief. The patient states that she used to play a lot of soccer in high school so she notes that she has had other right foot injuries but not like this.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Positive right ankle pain.
Skin: Positive warmth to the right foot.
Neurological: Denies any numbness or tingling.

VITALS

BP: 120/80
SPO2: 98%.

PHYSICAL EXAM

CV: Capillary refill is less than 3 seconds. Strong dorsalis pedis pulse.
NEURO: Normal sensation. Sensation is intact to light touch distally.
MSK: Examination of the right ankle reveals ecchymosis over the lateral malleolus associated with swelling. Tenderness to palpation anterolaterally in the soft tissue. No laxity on anterior drawer or inversion stress. No bony tenderness on palpation of the foot.

RESULTS

X-ray of the right ankle taken in office today reveals no fracture or bony abnormalities.

ASSESSMENT

Right ankle sprain.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to her current symptoms. I have explained to her that her symptoms are consistent with a right ankle sprain. I have recommended that we treat the patient conservatively. I have advised her to keep her right leg elevated when she is seated. I have also advised her to ice her right ankle 5 times per day for 20 minutes at a time to help with the swelling. I have also recommended that the patient be placed in an Aircast to stabilize the ankle. She will remain non-weight-bearing for 1 to 2 days, we provided her with crutches today, and then she can begin weight-bearing as tolerated.

INSTRUCTIONS

If her pain does not improve over the next week, she will contact the office and we will obtain an MRI.

aci,ACI092,"[doctor]  Hey Matthew, how are you doing?
[patient]  Hey Doc, I'm doing pretty good. How are you?
[doctor]  I'm doing pretty good, hey. I see here in the nurses' notes it looks like you hurt your left ankle. Can you tell me a little bit more about that?
[patient]  Yeah, I did my wife and I were on a walk yesterday and I was just talking to her and and stepped off the curb and landed on it wrong. It's kind of embarrassing, but it's been killing me for a couple days now.
[doctor]  Okay now when you felt did you feel or hear a pop or anything like that.
[patient]  I wouldn't say I really heard a pop, it was just kind of really kind of felt extended and stretched. And it has just been really bothering me ever since kind of on the outside of it.
[doctor]  Okay, and then were you able to walk on it after the incident?
[patient]  I was able to get back to the house because I didn't want to make my wife carry me, but it was painful.
[doctor]  Okay, and then have you done any or had any injuries to that ankle before?
[patient]  Nothing substantial that I would say in the past.
[doctor]  Okay, and then what have you been doing for that left ankle since then have you done anything to help make it make the painless?
[patient]  I have taken some ibuprofen and then I just tried to elevate it and ice it a little bit and keep my weight off of it.
[doctor]  Okay, so let's talk real quick about your pain level zero being none 10 being the worst pain you've been in in your life without any medication on board. Can you rate your pain for me?
[patient]  I would say it's about a date.
[doctor]  Okay, and then when you do take that ibuprofen or Tylenol, what's your relief level? What's your pain look like then?
[patient]  Maybe a seven and it's a little.
[doctor]  Okay, now you mention going for a walk my wife, and I've been on on back behind the new rec center where the new trails are have you guys been back there.
[patient]  We haven't yet, but I'm sure we'll check it out ever since I feel like working at home during COVID-19.
[doctor]  Yai!
[patient]  No, I haven't been there yet.
[doctor]  Yeah, those those trails are great. There's like five miles of regular flat trails. And then there's a bunch of hiking trails that they've opened up as well. It's a really great place. Man, you guys need to get out there. We'll get you fixed up and we'll get you back out there, okay?
[patient]  Awesome.
[doctor]  So let's talk a little bit about my physical exam. If it's okay with you, I'm going to do a quick physical exam on you. Your vitals look stable. By the way, a little elevated. I know you're in pain on a focused exam of your left ankle now. I do appreciate that there is echinosis or bruising over the lateral maliolis. And there is some swelling. I do appreciate some adema now. You are positive for tenderness to palpation on the lateral side and the the soft tissue is swollen here. The good news is I do not appreciate any laxity in the joint. Okay. And I don't feel any any type of bony tenderness to palpation of your foot now on the neurovascular exam of your left foot capillary refill is brisk less than three seconds. And I do appreciate strong dorsalus pitus pulses. And you do have motor and sensation intact, which is good now. It's important that they were compared bilaterally and they are yeah your exam is the same bilaterally so that that's an important thing. Now we did do an x-ray of that left ankle. When you came in, so I'm going to review those x-ray results with you now. The good news is I do not appreciate a fracture or any bony abnormalities. So that's a good thing right. So let me talk to you a little bit about my assessment and plan. So for your first problem of your left ankle pain, your symptoms are consistent with an ankle sprain of the lateral ligament complex and the ligament on the outside of your ankle is what got stretched when you fell now the best treatment for. This sprain is what you've kind of already been doing doing the elevation and compression and ice. So we're going to continue the rice protocol. And I'm going to go ahead and give you an air cast just to stabilize that ankle. I'm going to prescribe you some crutches. I want you to stay off that leg, but I do want you to start walking as tolerated, but it may be a few days before you feel like doing that now your symptoms are going to get better significantly over the first you know four five six seven days. But I'm going to want to follow up with you just to make sure you're doing okay. So what I do is I would like to see you in two weeks and I'm going to have you continue taking those NSDS as well to help reduce that pain and swelling any other questions, comments or concerns before I have the nurse come in and get you fixed up.
[patient]  No, I think that sounds like a plan.
[doctor]  Okay sounds good like I said I will see you in two weeks if you have any questions or if you have a lot of pain come back and will reevaluate otherwise I think you're headed in the right direction and I'll see you again in two weeks.

aci,ACI093,"[doctor]  Hi Jeremy, how are you?
[patient]  I'm really good thank you how are you?
[doctor]  I'm okay that the medical assistant told me that you had this ulcer on your foot that's been there for a couple of weeks.
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  Going away.
[patient]  It's been there gosh, it's like six or so weeks right now and it's since on my right foot. And it's just yet, it's just not going away. I'm not sure if it maybe even got a little worse from when I first noticed it.
[doctor]  Okay, and how long did you say it's going on for?
[patient]  Probably about.
[doctor]  6-8 weeks maybe.
[patient]  Okay, and do you have any pain in your foot? No, no, no, pain at all. Okay. Now I know that you're a diabetic and you're on some insulin. Have your sugar's been running. Okay. They have been running.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  You know, in the most part, they seem to be running a little higher than normal.
[doctor]  Your sugars are running higher than normal. Okay, do you recall what your last hemoglobin A1c was at above 9?
[patient]  Yes, it definitely was higher than 9.
[doctor]  Okay, alright now, what do you think caused this ulcer? Were you wearing some tight-fitting shoes? Or did you have some trauma to your foot? Or...
[patient]  Yeah, I was, you know, I think initially, I mean, I was out in the backyard, you know, kind of, you know, doing some work. And, you know, I know, you know, I could have stepped on a nail or, you know, there was some other work, but you know, I'm always outside. So I don't know if that kind of led to anything or caused anything.
[doctor]  Okay, alright, and have you had any fever or chills?
[patient]  No, no, no fever or chills. You know, I kind of get headaches pretty often. I don't know if it, you know, I don't know if it's stress or, but you know, always have like the tension headaches in the front.
[doctor]  Okay, and do you have, do you have neuropathy where you get like numbing and tingling in your feet?
[patient]  Occasionally, yeah, occasionally, especially once like colder outside.
[doctor]  Mm-hmm, kind of feels like it takes a little longer to.
[patient]  Warm up, but yeah, I kind of have some sensation in all my extremities.
[doctor]  Okay alright, and then are you a smoker or did you smoke?
[patient]  I did back, you know, kind of years ago I did, but yeah, I haven't smoked anything in a good number of years.
[doctor]  Okay, alright when did you stop smoking?
[patient]  A couple years ago, maybe four or so years ago.
[doctor]  Okay, alright, and how many packs a day would you smoke?
[patient]  Gosh back then, yeah was at least two.
[doctor]  Okay, all right, how many years did you smoke for like 20?
[patient]  Yeah, at least 20 at 20 plus years.
[doctor]  Okay, all right now. Any other symptoms do you have any problems when you walk down the street? Do you get any pain in your calves at all when you walk?
[patient]  No, no, no, no, no, pain. You know, just kind of you know, it's just I know that it's there.
[doctor]  Okay, and you said you're active you're out in the yard, and things like that you go on long walks at all or no.
[patient]  No, no, you know, it's, you know, I just kind of feel like I've been just trying to take it easy lately.
[doctor]  Hmm.
[patient]  But your most most of the stuff I've been doing is just kind of hanging around the house.
[doctor]  Okay, all right, so we talked a little bit about your diabetes. Let's talk about your heart disease. Now your heart disease, you had a heart attack in 2018. We put a stent into your right coronary artery. You're still taking your medications for that. You're still on your aspirin.
[patient]  I am yes, yeah, I do the baby aspirin every day.
[doctor]  Okay, alright, an NHS pain or shortness of breath or anything like that no-no, you know nothing more than ya, I wouldn't attribute anything.
[patient]  Okay, and do you have a podiatrist for your yearly foot exams?
[doctor]  No, I, I, I don't okay. All right, all right. Well, let's go ahead. I want to just do a quick physical exam. I'm just going to be calling out some of my exam findings. So your vital signs here in the office, you don't have any fever. So that's good. Your blood pressure is great. It's like 127 over 80 and your heart rate is nice and slow in the 60s on your neck exam. I don't appreciate any jugular venous distension or any carotid. Brutes on your lung exam, your lungs are clear to osculation. By laterally on your heart exam, you do have a two out of six systolic ejection murmur hurt at the left base and on your lower extremity exam I don't appreciate any palpable dorsalis pedus or posterior tibial pulses there is a two by three centimeter ulcerated lesion on the right lateral foot near the fifth metacarpal metatarsophilangial joint. There is no associated cellulitis. Does it hurt when I press here?
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  There is no pain to palpation of the right foot. There is associated granulation tissue and some slight purulent discharge from the wound, okay. So what does all that mean that just means that you have this ulcer that's fairly sizable with I think we need to do some good wound care on? It lets talk a little bit about my assessment and plan so you know, are you have a non-healing ulcer of your right foot? So we need to do some studies on you to see. If you have an adequate blood supply to heal, this foot wound. And since you, since you probably don't because of your diabetes you're here in a vascular surgeon's office, we may have to go ahead and talk about being able to open up some of your arteries to improve the blood supply to your foot. So that might mean getting a stent to one of your arteries in your legs to open up the blood supply, it might mean that we might have to do some bypass surgery to improve the blood supply to your foot. In order to heal that wound, I do think that you'll be able to heal it. I don't think that we need to do anything drastic. I want you to continue with your aspirin because that will help.
[patient]  Any questions?
[doctor]  Yeah, I mean, is this do we have to do any more tests or anything? What are you going to do in arterial ultrasound? I'm going to go ahead and order an arterial ultrasound of your lower extremities to see what the blood supply is like. And then I'm going to go ahead and order a podiatry consult because I want them to see this wound and improve the wound care that you're doing. And then for your next problem, your diabetes, I want to go ahead and talk to your primary care physician. We need to get your diabetes better controlled because that impacts your wound healing as well okay.
[patient]  Sure.
[doctor]  Sure understood, all right. And for your last issue, your coronary artery disease continue with your statin. And I will talk to your cardiologist in case you need a procedure to see if you're cleared from a medical standpoint, OK?
[patient]  Okay, perfect.
[doctor]  Alright.
[patient]  Perfect, thank you so much.
[doctor]  Okay, bye.","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Right foot ulcer.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Jeremy Roberts is a 79-year-old male who presents today for evaluation of a right foot ulcer. He reports an ulcer on his right foot has been present for approximately 6 to 8 weeks. He first noticed the ulcer after working outside. There is no associated pain, however, he feels the ulcer may have worsened from when he first noticed it. He denies experiencing any fevers or chills. He does however experience tension headaches quite frequently. He denies any pain in his calves when he walks. At this time the patient does not have a podiatrist for yearly foot exams.

He is a diabetic and takes insulin. His blood sugar has been running higher than normal and his last hemoglobin A1c was higher than 9. Occasionally he will also experience numbness and tingling in his feet, especially with colder weather.

In terms of his heart disease, the patient sustained a heart attack in 2018 and underwent stent placement at the right coronary artery. He is currently taking aspirin 81 mg daily. He denies chest pain or shortness of breath.

MEDICAL HISTORY

Patient reports history of diabetes and heart disease. He sustained a heart attack in 2018.

SURGICAL HISTORY

Patient reports undergoing stent placement at the right coronary artery.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient reports he is a former smoker. He previously smoked 2 packs a day for 20 years and was able to stop smoking approximately 4 years ago. Currently he is not very active but he does work around the house.

MEDICATIONS

Patient reports taking aspirin 81 mg daily and insulin.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Constitutional: Denies fevers and chills.
Cardiovascular: Denies chest pain.
Respiratory: Denies dyspnea.
Skin: Patient reports right foot ulcer.
Neurological: Patient reports headaches and numbness and tingling in feet.

VITALS

No fever.
Blood pressure: 127/80
Heart rate: 60s

PHYSICAL EXAM

CV: 2/6 systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base.
RESPIRATORY: Clear to auscultation bilaterally
NECK: No jugular venous distention or carotid bruits
MSK: Examination of the right lower extremity: No palpable dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial pulses. There is a 2 x 3 cm ulcerated lesion on the right lateral foot near the 5th metacarpal metatarsophalangeal joint. No associated cellulitis. No pain to palpation of the right foot. There is associated granulation tissue and some slight purulent discharge from the wound.

ASSESSMENT

1. Non-healing ulcer, right foot
2. Diabetes
3. Coronary artery disease

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. We discussed that his right foot ulcer is fairly sizable and will require wound care. I advised him that the ulcer does not appear to be healing and that further studies will be needed to assess if he has adequate blood supply to heal his foot wound. He was advised that due to his diabetes it is possible surgical intervention such as stent placement or bypass surgery may be required to improve his blood supply. I also advised him that I believe we will be able to heal his wound. At this time, I have recommended continued wound care and for him to also continue taking aspirin 81 mg daily. We will order an arterial ultrasound of the lower extremities. He will also be referred to podiatry for a consult.

Regarding his diabetes, this appears to be unstable as the patient reports his last hemoglobin a1c was greater than 9 and is now experiencing a non-healing right foot ulcer. We discussed the importance of blood sugar control as this will impact his wound healing. At this time, I have recommended that he follow-up with his primary care physician for further care.

The patient's coronary artery disease is currently stable. It is recommended that he continue to take his statin as prescribed. I will contact his cardiologist for medical clearance should surgical intervention be required for his non-healing right foot ulcer."
aci,ACI100,"[patient]  I get afternoon jose of how are you doing today?
[doctor]  I'm doing well, but my big toe hurts and it's a little red too, but it really hurts okay how long has this been going on I would say you know off and on for about two weeks, but last week is is when it really became painful I was at AA trade show convention and I couldn't walk the halls I couldn't do anything. I just had to stand there and it really hurt the whole time I was there
[patient]  Okay, does it throb, ache burn, what kind of pain do you get with it?
[doctor]  It's almost like a throbbing pain, but occasionally it becomes almost like a sharp stabbing pain, especially if I move it or spend too much time walking I find myself walking on my heel just to keep that toe from bending.
[patient]  Okay, sorry I got a text and...
[doctor]  Well, that's okay, you know what I, you know what I really, you know I love to ride bikes, have you ride bike at all?
[patient]  No, I hate riding a bike. I'm more a runner.
[doctor]  My gosh, I love to ride. I ride the lot of rails, the trails. I mean, I go all the last year. I put in over 800 miles on rails, the trails.
[patient]  Yeah, those are nice.
[doctor]  Yeah
[patient]  Does it does riding your bike bother your big toe?
[doctor]  No, because I kind of pedal with the back of my feet, you know on that side.
[patient]  Okay, do you wear clips or you just wearing a regular shoe and on a regular pedal?
[doctor]  I'm on a regular shoe, some most of the time I'm in my flip flops.
[patient]  Okay, okay. The how is there anything that you were doing out of the ordinary when this started?
[doctor]  No, I don't, that's the thing I don't remember an injury. If it was something that I injured, I think I would have just ignored it and wouldn't have showed up here, but when it got red and warm to touch, that's when I was really concerned.
[patient]  Okay, do does even light pressure to it bother it like at night when you're laying in bed to the sheets bother.
[doctor]  Absolutely, I was just going to say when I'm in bed at night and those sheets come down on it or I roll over Yeah, that hurts a lot.
[patient]  Okay, have you done anything to try to get it to feel better any soaks or taking any medicine?
[doctor]  I take you know like a 2 ibuprofen a day and that doesn't seem to help.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Alrighty.
[patient]  Let me see your foot here and let me take your big toe through a range of motion if I push your top to bottom.
[doctor]  Yeah, out.
[patient]  Big toe joint that okay and let me move it up whereas I bend it up does that hurt.
[doctor]  It hurts, but not as much as when you moved it down.
[patient]  Okay, so I'm moving it down here and I've got about 10 degrees of plantar flexion, does that hurt?
[doctor]  Yeah, it a little when you take it a little further.
[patient]  If I go a little bit further to 20 degrees, does that hurt?
[doctor]  That hurts more, yeah.
[patient]  Okay, if I push it on your big toe and move it back and forth does that hurt.
[doctor]  Yes, it does, and it's almost like those joints that when you push it back, it's almost like it's grinding a little bit too.
[patient]  Okay, if I push in between your big toe and your second toe, here does that hurt.
[doctor]  A little bit, but not terrible.
[patient]  Okay, what about if I push on the other side here?
[doctor]  Yeah, you're right there on the outside of it, absolutely.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Yep.
[patient]  Okay, and I'm feeling a little bit of bone spur here, as well let me get next ray.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  and after we take a peek, that will develop a plan.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  So at this point, what would I do if I'm going out of the room and then coming back?
[doctor]  You could hit pause or hit the stop button and just restart at the next time you come in.
[patient]  Okay, alrighty. So taking a look at your X-ray and you do have you, you have a large spur there on the top of your big toe joint.
[doctor]  Oh
[patient]  And you've lost a lot of the cartilage.
[doctor]  Oh
[patient]  And so you've got some arthritis in there we call this Halux rigidis and treatment for this to start off with. We put an insert in your shoe called an orthotic and we give you a little bit of anti-inflammatory medication or like a drug called maloxicam. You only have to take it once a day.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  It's usually pretty well tolerated, have you ever had any trouble with your stomach?
[doctor]  No never never had any problems with my stomach. I love the I love the Mexican's food, the hotter the better. So I hope I never get a problem with my stomach.
[patient]  I hope you don't either. One of the things that we get concerned about with an anti-inflammatory like that is that it can irritate the stomach. So if you do start to notice that you're getting heartburn or pain right there.
[doctor]  Yeah
[patient]  Below your sternum, you would need to stop taking the medicine and give me a call.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  And I want to see you back in two weeks to see how you're doing with that. If you're not seeing significant improvement, then we may have to talk about doing things that are a little more invasive like doing a shot.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  or even surgery to clean out the joint sometimes.
[doctor]  Is that surgery?
[patient]  I have to.
[doctor]  Would that be?
[patient]  I'm sorry.
[doctor]  Would that be surgery clean out the joint?
[patient]  Yeah, that would.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  That would be surgery if we went in and cleaned out the joints sometimes in really severe cases. We even just have to fuse the big toe joint we put it in a position of optimal function and we fuse it there. And then your pain goes away, you lose some motion, but you've already lost quite a bit of motion and the pain goes away so that that surgery really is very effective. But let's try to run from my knife a little bit longer.
[doctor]  Okay, well you know I don't think I'm going to be able to do my work job. I'm on my feet every day and IITS and and quite frankly it's fishing season. So do you think you can give me a couple weeks off? So I can get out and get some fishing done.
[patient]  No, I want you to be doing your regular activities. I want to know how this because if I put you out of work, can you come back in and say it feels better well? Is it because of the treatment or because of the rest? So, no, I want you to keep working. I want you to do your regular activities. And I really want you to put these or the the the the test and this medicine to the test. And we will see how you're doing in two weeks.
[doctor]  Okay, where I really like catching blue going croppy. So okay, we'll keep working then I'll find time to do that later.
[patient]  Very good we will see you in two weeks.
[doctor]  Okay, thank you.","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Right great toe pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Joseph Walker is a pleasant 58-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right great toe pain. The onset of his pain began 2 weeks ago, however it worsened last week. He noticed the pain worsening when he was at a trade show convention and he could not ambulate as he was forced to stand there as the pain was there the whole time. He denies any specific injury. The patient describes his pain usually as throbbing and burning, but notes it occasionally changes to sharp, stabbing pain especially with movement or prolonged ambulation. His symptoms also include redness to the right great toe. The patient states that he has been ambulating on his heel to keep his toe from bending. He reports that his pain is present even with the slightest of pressure, which he notes is worse at night when his sheet is touching his right toe. He adds that he has been taking 2 ibuprofen per day, which does not provide him with relief.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient reports that he likes to bicycle ride.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports right great toe pain.
Skin: Reports redness.

PHYSICAL EXAM

MSK: Examination of the right great toe reveals 10 degrees of plantar flexion with pain. Pain to palpation of the right great toe, between the big toe and 2nd toe. Palpated a bone spur on the right great toe.

RESULTS

X-ray of the right great toe taken today in office reveals a large bone spur on the anterior aspect of the right great toe joint. There is a loss of cartilage with some arthritis present.

ASSESSMENT

Right foot hallux rigidus.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. I have explained to him that his x-rays revealed hallux rigidus. We discussed treatment options for this and I have recommended that we begin with conservative treatment in the form of custom orthotics. I have also prescribed the patient meloxicam once a day to treat the pain. The patient was instructed to discontinue use and contact the office if gastrointestinal issues develop. I advised the patient that I want him to continue his regular activities.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me in 2 weeks to check on his progress. If his pain does not improve with the orthotics, I will recommend a cortisone injection or surgical intervention."
aci,ACI102,"[doctor]  Hey Elijah, how are you?
[patient]  I'm doing okay.
[doctor]  So I see here that your primary care provider sent you over, it looks like you were doing some yard work yesterday and dropped a landscape brick on your foot. Can what so what's going on with your right foot today?
[patient]  It's a little sore today, but you know I hurt my foot before, but this is the first time where I'm actually being seen for it.
[doctor]  Okay, so you saved injured your right foot before. Tell me a little bit about that injury.
[patient]  20 years ago, I broke my ankle, I had to put in a cast, but that seems to be okay, but you know sometimes it'll give me trouble once in a while it feels a little sore it swells up at times.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  And my other ankle too is sore sometimes, and I've had surgery for that too, and you know one of those things where you know it might give out once in a while. But I'm not sure that's related to what the you know break dropping on my foot, but you know either way my foot's a little sore.
[doctor]  Okay, all right, so when you drop that brick on your foot, where you able to get up and keep working, or did you have to get off your, you know, not stop weight bearing, and get off that foot, can you tell me a little bit about after the traumatic incident?
[patient]  You know, it was a little sore. I called a few names. You know, God damn, why is this in my foot? But you know, I kept working putting around a little bit, but now it's got swollen. So I got to see my doctor. He told me I had to go see you here. I'm so tell me what's going on with it.
[doctor]  So, what have you been doing for the pain since the initial insult?
[patient]  Looking it up.
[doctor]  Okay, have you taken any medication safe, for example Tylenol or ibuprofen for the pain?
[patient]  No, I feel like taking the medicine.
[doctor]  Okay, and then just out of curiosity you said you were doing some landscaping have you been over to landscapes where house new here and tell my wife and I were just over there this last weekend and picked up a whole bunch of stuff you had a chance to make it over there yet.
[patient]  No, not yet I heard about it, though I might have to make a trip once my foot heals.
[doctor]  Alright, that sounds good. Now just out of curiosity, can you rate your pain for me right now? Zero being none-ten being the worst pain you've ever been in your life?
[patient]  11 out of 10.
[doctor]  Okay, and then have you experienced any numbness or tingling of that foot since the incident?
[patient]  Yeah, the whole foot is numb.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  but been now for a long time.
[doctor]  Okay, I'm going to do a quick physical exam. Now your vitals look good. And I would like to do a focused exam of your right foot that there is some bruising on the bottom part of your foot and on the top part as well. And I do appreciate the associated swelling. And I also recognize that you do have tenderness to palpation for midfoot now for your neurovascular exam of your right foot, your capillary refill is brisk and less than three. Seconds, I do note a strong bounding dorsalis pedispulse with motor. And sensation is intact for that foot. I also like to call out the fact that it matches bilaterally, which is important I'm going to go ahead and review the diagnostic imaging results. So we did an x-ray of that right foot. And I do notice dorsal displacement of the base of the second metatarsal with a three millimeter separation of the first and second metatarsal bases and presence of bony fragments. So let me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan. Now your right foot pain is due to a lyss frank fracture, which is a fracture to your second metatarsal bone. And the top of your foot this is where the metatarsals meet those cuboids. Okay, so it were the bones come together in your foot now. There are a lot of ligaments in your foot. So I do want to order an MRI just to assess if there is any injuries to those ligaments now based on your exam and looking at the x-ray your most likely going to need surgery. Now the reason why this is important is if we have poor bone alignment or ligament healing, you can this can lead to losing the arch in your foot, you could be coming flat footed and also developing arthritis. Now what's going to be key here is the surgery is going to allow those bones and ligaments to heal properly. We are going to put them back into place using plates and screws. Now the key thing is going to be it's going to be outpatient surgery. So it's going to be same day. I'll see you in the morning and then you'll be discharged home that evening and we will do a follow up. I want to see you in 24 hours post procedure, but then I'll see you again in two weeks. You're going to be in a cast and I'm going to have you use crutches. You're not going to be able to wait bear on that foot for six to eight weeks. What we'll do is we'll advance your ambulating gradually based on how you heal and based on how you tolerate the procedure. I know I have covered a lot of material quickly, but this is really going to be the best course of action for you to have a good outcome. Now do you have any questions come answers concerns before I have the nurse come and finish the paperwork and get you set up for your procedure, which we are going to do tomorrow if you're agreeable to that.
[patient]  What about putting in a cast? Can I just stay in the cast?
[doctor]  You could but what we found is the best outcome is aligning those bones with plates and screws to make sure that they heal properly, so you have the best outcome possible.
[patient]  So if the surgery is going to be tomorrow, what am I going to get my MRI?
[doctor]  So what we will do is the good news is we have an outpatient MRI facility downstairs and I'm going to send the order down and we'll get you your MRI this afternoon.
[patient]  Can I think about it? And we have some time.
[doctor]  Sure.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Alright, thanks Elijah.","CHIEF COMPLAINT

aci,ACI108,"[doctor]  All right, Brittany. So I see that you were experiencing some right foot pain. Could you tell me what happened?
[patient]  Yeah, while I was playing tennis, and I was trying to know volleyball.
[doctor]  Hmm.
[patient]  It was like a double game and I was trying to volley the ball. And I got in front of another player and actually ended up falling on top of my foot.
[doctor]  Alright.
[patient]  And then yet kind of hurt, I quickly then twisted myself around her because I was trying to catch myself, but then I started to feel some pain in my foot.
[doctor]  Bum! Okay, have you ever injured that foot before?
[patient]  You know, sorry I injured my other foot before not this foot.
[doctor]  Okay, so right now you're experiencing right leg pain, but you have injured your left leg before. Is that what I'm hearing?
[patient]  Yeah, that's fine.
[doctor]  Alright, were you able to continue playing?
[patient]  No, I had to stop. I actually was like I had to be held from a field because I couldn't put weight on my foot.
[doctor]  I'm sorry, okay. So what have you been doing for the pain since then?
[patient]  I wrapped it after the game. They had some ace wraps in their clubhouse. And so I wrapped it up and then I iced it last night. And I just kept it up on a pillow. And then I took some ibuprofen.
[doctor]  Okay, could you one more time when did this injury happen?
[patient]  This happened about a couple days ago.
[doctor]  Okay, so did you say whether does the ibuprofen help at all?
[patient]  Yeah, it helps a little bit, but then you know it, you know after a while it wears out.
[doctor]  Okay, and then have you experienced any numbness or tingling?
[patient]  No, no, no, miss.
[doctor]  Okay, alright, any loss in sensation.
[patient]  No, I mean I can still feel like I can still feel my foot.
[doctor]  Okay, all right, that's good to hear. So you were playing tennis, is that what you normally do to work out?
[patient]  I don't try to learn, but I cannot afford tennis lessons. So me and my friends just hit the balls back and forth I do sleep.
[doctor]  I love it absolutely, yeah my dad, one time took me to play a racket ball, and I learned the very bruisey way that that wasn't for me, yeah.
[patient]  That scares me.
[doctor]  It's a day they move pretty fast, I'm not gonna lie alright so. If you don't mind I'm gonna go ahead and do my my physical exam. I'm gonna be calling out some of my findings but if you have any questions go ahead stop me let me know but I will be explaining along the way okay.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Alright, so I've looked at your vitals and honestly they look great. You know your blood pressure. I see is 125 over 70. That's almost textbook respiratory rate. We are seeing you at a smooth 18. Excuse me, your temperature. You're running normal 97. One you're sadding at 100%. And then your pulse. So that's interesting like you're going at like about 60 beats a minute. So I think they're, I think we're doing pretty well. I'm going to go ahead and listen to your heart on your heart exam. I don't appreciate any like murmur rub or gallop. We have a nice regular rate and rhythm for your lung exam. I do appreciate a little bit of strider that's really interesting, but I don't. Here any weases or rals so that's great for. Here I know this sounds weird, but for your abdominal exam I don't appreciate any rebound no guarding on your skin exam. I don't sorry like on your head everything looks symmetrical your mucosal membranes are normal. You don't feel hot to touch. So that's great, but I'm going to do my foot exam. Okay, so on the right foot there is some bruising of the plantar and dorsal aspects of the foot there is associated swelling when I touch on. Your mid foot here does it hurt.
[patient]  Noah
[doctor]  Okay, all right, tenderness to palpation of the midfoot and positive piano key test of the first and second metatarsals. All right, it's also warm to touch. All right, so on your neurovascular exam of your right foot, your capillary refill is less than three seconds strong dorsalis pedispulse. And your sensation is intact to light touch your left foot exam is normal capillary refill, is appropriate petal pulses are strong. And sensation is intact, so I know that before here we before, I came in that we got an X. Ray, so I've reviewed the results of your X-ray of your right foot and it showed subtle dorsal displacement of the base of the second metatarsal with a three millimeter separation of the first and second metatarsal bases. And the presence of a bony fragment in the Liz Frank joint space. All right, I know those were a bunch of fancy words, so now I'm going to explain to you what that all means for my impression and plan your first problem is right. Foot pain consistent with a Liz Frank fracture, which is A. Fracture to one of your second metatarsal bones near the top of your foot, right? So the big part of your toe is the first metatarsal the second part where you can kind of like bend it right. That's the that's the metatarsal that we're talking about based on your exam. And what I'm seeing on your X-ray, I am going to recommend surgery for your foot the surgery will help place the bones in their proper positions using plates and screws to help. Prevent further complications. There are also many ligaments at the top of your foot. So I will be ordering an MRI to further assess the fracture and any injury to the ligaments I know this is a lot you have any questions.
[patient]  Yet do I have to do the surgery?
[doctor]  So I'm recommending it as there can be significant complications to your foot. If you don't, it can lead to poor bone alignment or poor ligament healing, which can lead to you losing the arch of your foot and becoming flatfooted. You can also develop arthritis in that foot. So yes, I, I highly recommend it if you want to be able to walk and move about in a way that you are familiar with.
[patient]  I just hate that word surgery doc.
[doctor]  I know.
[patient]  You know, it scares me every time, I mean especially with my foot, I want to be able to walk again. And so, I just get really worried I mean how long is the procedure usually, too.
[doctor]  So it's actually...
[patient]  have to be in the hospital.
[doctor]  No, no, no, no, no, it's actually a day surgery, and you'll be able to go home the same day. And then you will follow up with me here in the clinic in about a week, you'll be in a cast, and you will use crutches as you will not be able to use that foot for six to eight weeks after that you'll start gradually walking on your foot based on how you do. So the procedure itself is not very long you will, and so like since you'll be able to go home, that's great. But you won't be able to drive especially since. You're saying are you left-handed or right-handed?
[patient]  I'm right-handed.
[doctor]  Yes, so your your right foot is probably your dominant one and the also the one you're supposed to drive with. So no, you're going to need somebody to take you home, but what?
[patient]  I mean
[doctor]  A-ah.
[patient]  Does that mean I'm out for the rest of the season? I mean, I want to be able to get back and play again. I really am. I'm getting a little better. So I...
[doctor]  Hmm.
[patient]  I really want to keep on playing my tennis with my friends, but...
[doctor]  Yes, so unfortunately, yes, it does mean that you're out for the rest of the season, but hopefully we can get you a great get you to a setup well for next season. And in the meantime, I think I'm going to recommend after surgery that we get you to physical therapy, I think that that's going to be a really great way to like kind of strengthen the muscles and make sure that you're at peak performance before we put you back out there.
[patient]  I suppose so.
[doctor]  Yeah
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Alright.
[patient]  Thank you.
[doctor]  No problem. So I do want to let you know that there are some risks associated with any kind of surgical procedure I'm going to bring you some paperwork and that my mom is going to go over with you such as like risks of bleeding loss of sensation or of damage. All those things will be discussed with you. And if you have any questions leading up to and even after your procedure go ahead and ask them and we'll be more than happy to help with that, okay?
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Alright.
[patient]  Good.
[doctor]  Thank you.
[patient]  Thank you.","HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Brittany Edwards is a 76-year-old female, right-hand-dominant, female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right foot pain. The onset of her pain began 2 days ago, when she was playing tennis and was trying to volley the ball when she got in front of another player and fell on the dorsal aspect of her right foot. She states that she quickly twisted her foot because she was trying to catch herself. The patient reports that she was unable to continue playing secondary to the pain. She states that she wrapped her foot after the game and iced it last night. The patient adds that she kept her foot up on a pillow and took ibuprofen for pain. She denies any numbness. The patient denies any loss of sensation.

The patient has a history of a left leg injury.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports right foot pain.
Neurological: Denies numbness in the right foot.

PHYSICAL EXAM

SKIN: Warm
NEURO: Normal sensation.
MSK:
Examination of the right foot: Bruising of the plantar and dorsal aspects of the foot. Associated swelling. Tenderness to palpation of the midfoot. Positive piano key test of the 1st and 2nd metatarsals. Warm to touch. Neurovascular intact distally. Capillary refill is less than 3 seconds. Strong dorsalis pedis pulse.
Examination of the left foot: Brisk capillary refill to all digits and light touch intact.

RESULTS

3 views of the right foot were taken. These reveal subtle dorsal displacement of the base of the 2nd metatarsal with a 3 mm separation of the 1st and 2nd metatarsal bases. There is the presence of a bony fragment in the Lisfranc joint space.

ASSESSMENT

Right foot pain, consistent with a Lisfranc fracture.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to her current symptoms. I have explained to her that her x-rays revealed a Lisfranc fracture. We discussed treatment options for this and I have recommended that we proceed with surgical intervention. The plan is to proceed with a right foot ORIF and all indicated procedures. We went over the risk, benefits, and alternatives of the surgery. The risk include but not limited to continued pain, swelling, damage to surrounding tissue including nerves and blood vessels, numbness that could be permanent, infection, nonunion, malunion, failure of hardware, and need for further surgery. There is always a risk of amputation, heart attack, stroke, blood clots, pulmonary embolism, and death. There is a possibility of chronic pain and the inability to get back to the previous level of function. The patient wishes to proceed with the operation and she will follow up with me on the day of surgery. In the meantime, I have recommended that the patient attend formal physical therapy to strengthen her right foot.
