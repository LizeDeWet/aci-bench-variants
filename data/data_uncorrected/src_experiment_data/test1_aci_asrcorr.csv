aci,ACI000,"[doctor]  So Jerry is a 45-year-old male who came in today with an ankle injury Jerry what happened.
[patient]  Hey, Dr. Michael. Yeah. So my son, Sean, I think you're in the past. He started playing basketball and then we do multiple seasons. And so we're kind of getting ready for the next season that starts in April. And we were at the courts plan and I went up for a shot and he's far more aggressive than with me than he is with you know his peers. I guess he could say. And so he found me while I was going for a lap. And then when I came down I kind of landed awkwardly and I kind of like rolled and twisted my my ankle. So now it's it's hurting a bit like kind of on the outside. You can even see it's it's bruised up and a bit swollen.
[doctor]  Yeah
[patient]  And yeah, I've been having trouble walking and it just doesn't feel solid, really stable, which is a problem I recently got back into working out and I had been in a really good rhythm going to the gym.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  And I wanted to shrub that moment on because it took a lot for me to get back to a good place so.
[doctor]  Absolutely okay, totally understand that glad to hear that you're back out on the court playing with your son. How is he doing by the way?
[patient]  He is doing great, he is doing great. I mean, you know, he is a big step-kai fan. So he likes to keep up shots from from way out past the three-point line. And he is only 10 and tiny, so it's not a good idea for him to do that. But he is doing really well. And I'm just happy he's tried every sport and basketball is really what took. So I'm just really happy that he has a sport and loves and couple of his buddies plan to lead with him. So it's just makes me happy that he's found something he really enjoys.
[doctor]  Good, good to hear. Well, let's take a look at that ankle. It looks like it's pretty swollen. So let me just do a quick exam on that right now. Alright, so it looks like the outside of your ankle. If I push on that, does that hurt pretty bad?
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  Okay, so exquisite tenderness, tenderness laterally. And then if I push here, does that hurt too?
[patient]  Yeah, a little bit.
[doctor]  Okay, so some tenderness over the medial deltoid region. So swelling on the lateral side of the ankle, no epidermalysis skin, is intact looks like you have brisk capillary refill, no horrible malalignment. So, all right, can you stand on it? Did you say that you're having trouble walking at all?
[patient]  Yeah, I mean I can stand on it and I can't walk on it. It just it hurts and it feels like I'm going to possibly injure more Just because it doesn't feel particularly solid
[doctor]  Sure, so it doesn't quite feel stable.
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  Okay, okay, I gotcha. So I know you had an X-ray as you came in today. And so I'm just looking at this X-ray here. I'll show you on the screen right here. I can turn my monitor towards you. This is an AP lateral oblique. And this is your right ankle. So what we're looking at is a displaced lateral mulealis at the Weber C level. There's no evidence of medial or posterior muleal or fractures. But this is a fracture on the lateral side of your ankle now based on the position. It's a bit unstable. That's why you're feeling some of that that instability. When you're walking so for your diagnosis, what I'm going to put down is a lateral muleal or fracture. And what I would recommend for that since it is in the location that it is, is you're probably unfortunately going to need surgery. We're going to want to get that healed, what that includes is putting some plate and some screws in. And you're going to be out for a little bit. So I know you've been trying to work out and you want to get back on the court. But you may have to have to sit out for a little bit. We'll get you some crutches.
[patient]  How long it's a little bit, because I'm also, I forgot to say I'm also, I did volunteer to coach.
[doctor]  Great!
[patient]  starting in April so.
[doctor]  Alright, well.
[patient]  How long?
[doctor]  Yeah, you're probably going to be out for about three months, but continue the coaching go ahead. And then let's get you back out there. We'll get you some crutches. And then hopefully you can kind of get back on the court, start coaching. And then within that three months, we'll get you back out doing some exercise again.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Alright, in the meantime, I'm going to prescribe some medication for now. Let's try Meloxicam and try to get some of the swelling down I want you to ice it and also keep that that ankle elevated. Do you have a job where you can elevate your ankle regularly?
[patient]  Yeah, I work from home so that that shouldn't be a problem. It's just everything else I don't know who's going to walk my dogs and do all this stuff that's rest of my family refuses to walk my dog. So we'll figure it out.
[doctor]  Yeah, I am a dog walker as well. So all right. Sorry for the bad news, but let's get you healed up so that we can get you back out doing everything you need to do.
[patient]  Alright, thank you, doctor.
[doctor]  Alright, thanks.","CHIEF COMPLAINT

In the meantime, I will prescribe meloxicam to reduce swelling. I recommended he ice and elevate the ankle as well. He will be given crutches to assist with ambulation.

The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan."
aci,ACI008,"[doctor]  Hey Brandon, you know glad to see you in here today. I see on your chart that you're experiencing some neck pain could you tell me a bit about what happened.
[patient]  Yeah, I was in a car crash.
[doctor]  Well, okay when was that?
[patient]  What which car crash?
[doctor]  Okay, so multiple car crashes all right, so let's see if we can how many let's start.
[patient]  My therapist said, well, my well, actually my mother said I should go see the therapist, and the therapist said, I should see the lawyer, but my next hurting.
[doctor]  Okay, so I'm glad that you know you're getting some advice. And so let's talk about this neck pain, how many car crashes have we had recently?
[patient]  while the ones that are my fault were all of them.

[doctor]  Okay, the most recent crash, when was that?
[patient]  That's when I was coming home from the pain clinic because my neck hurt and my back hurt, but that was in February.
[doctor]  Okay, alright, so we had a car crash in February.
[patient]  What year? It was which February it was.
[doctor]  Okay, so let's try with this one. See what happens. Hopefully you remember I need you to start writing down these car crashes that this is becoming a thing, but you know it's okay. So let's say maybe you had a...
[patient]  You're not judging me are you?
[doctor]  No, there's no judgment here whatsoever. I want to make sure that I'm giving you the best advice possible. And in order to do that, I need the most information that you can provide me make sense.
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  Alright, so we're going to say hope maybe that you had a car crash and we can verify this in February of this year. And you've been experiencing some neck pain since then, right?
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  Okay, all right on a scale of 1 to 10, what 10 is your arm as being cut off by a chainsaw severe how bad is your pain.
[patient]  12
[doctor]  Okay, terrible pain. Now I know you mentioned you had previous car crashes and you've been to therapy, has anyone prescribed you any medication? It's you said you went to pain clinic, yes.
[patient]  Well, they had prescribed it recently. I was on Fennel.
[doctor]  Oh
[patient]  I haven't gone to prescription for several weeks.
[doctor]  Okay, all right. And so we will be able to check on that when you take your medication. So before you take your medication, rather like are you able to move like are you experiencing any stiffness?
[patient]  Yes, but it hurts.
[doctor]  Okay, it hurts what kind of pain is it sharp as a dull? Is it throbbing?
[patient]  It's the sharp incapacitating pain I can't work.
[doctor]  Wow, okay are you having any headaches?
[patient]  Of course.
[doctor]  Any Disney-ness.
[patient]  Just sometimes.
[doctor]  Any visual disturbances is it hard to like are you?
[patient]  not recently known.
[doctor]  Okay, alright, any numbness.
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  Where?
[patient]  My left arm and my right leg.
[doctor]  Okay, any spasms?
[patient]  Of course.
[doctor]  Okay, where?
[patient]  My body hurts, I told you my neck hurts.
[doctor]  Okay, so I know I'm absolutely I want to make sure that we are going to give you the medication that works like the best for you So I'm sorry if these questions seem like frustrating. I would just want to make sure that I understand what the problem is so
[patient]  I saw Pamela and Dr. Collins' office. She's much nicer than you know.
[doctor]  I mean, okay, so, you know, what, like, maybe, maybe Pamela would be better. Like, we could maybe talk about a referral if that would make you more comfortable.
[patient]  My lawyer told me to come here.
[doctor]  Then you're stuck with me, okay, I'm so sorry. But here it's we're gonna try and make it as good as possible, alright? So last thing, I do wanna do my physical exam, alright? And I need you to let me know as as much as you, as much as you can verbalize, right? So when I push here in the middle of your neck on top of the bone, does it hurt?
[patient]  Yes, yes.
[doctor]  Okay, alright, sorry, what about on the side? Does that hurt?
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  Okay, so pain on palpation both on the bony process and on the muscle can you move your neck from side to side? Can you move your neck? Can you swive at side to side? No, no, all right. So I'm I'm seeing I'm seeing some range of movement, moderate range of movement that's fine. Okay. I so when can you bend your neck forward that that's your whole body just just the neck are you capable of bending up?
[patient]  Really hurts, it really hurts.
[doctor]  Okay, it really hurts to bend forward and backwards. Okay, all right. So I'm just going to make a little note here. I don't I don't see any bruising. I'm not noticing any swelling there is. I I don't see any laceration what.
[patient]  to sometimes it bruises.
[doctor]  Okay, sometimes alright, that's fine. I just am not seeing one here today, so that's okay. Alright, so with that being said, I do want to ask have you been experiencing any fatigue? Are you tired?
[patient]  Well, since the accident, yes.
[doctor]  Okay, all right, just making sure okay. So this is what this is my assessment. And plan this is what we are going to do. I want to be able to like we had you do an x-ray before you came in here. And looking at it, I'm not noticing any fracture that's a really good sign considering how many car accidents we've been in lately.
[patient]  It hurts it hurts.
[doctor]  Absolutely no, I were going to address the pain so for my first so looking at your imaging results though I'm not seeing a fracture that's a great sign so for your first diagnosis I'm going to say that you have what is called a next brain that
[patient]  Thinking are you saying I'm thinking?
[doctor]  No not by any means I am saying.
[patient]  Paint I have a lot of paint.
[doctor]  Yes, and your pain can be explained by multiple things, but thankfully it's not a broken neck is that okay.
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  Alright, so what we are going to do when we are going to try and treat this as conservatively as possible.
[patient]  So it might be broken.
[doctor]  What?
[patient]  Pamela said it might be broken.
[doctor]  If Pamela said it's broken, then you know what this is what we're going to do. We're going to order something called a CT that's going to give us even no, you know what, let's upgrade to an MRI. It's going to give us the most thorough image of everything that's going on the heart. And the soft tissues is that going to, is that so that way we can really get a good image of what's happening inside, right?
[patient]  Okay, because what the lawyers said I needed was an MRI.
[doctor]  Not a problem where we're going to make your lawyer happy next step. We are going to try working like from the outside. And so I do need you to work on getting like you're saying you've seen some bruising and some swelling yourself. So I want you to put ice on that whenever you're experiencing that in the moment when you wake up, I want you to do your best to just like I'm going to give you some exercises on the sheet. And I want you to roll through these exercises every morning right to just get some like movement and like free for no-save movement back into your neck. I also want to put you on a couple of medications. Now I know that you said you were on fentanyl before that's a bit extreme. And I want to like monitor this a little more conservatively. So we're going to start with this something called row backsen.
[patient]  It hurts a lot if I don't get more fininal.
[doctor]  You know, we can refer you to pain medicine if it really is getting that complicated, but for this current period, we're going to put you on some rowbacks and it's going to be 1,500 milligrams. And you're going to take that six to eight hours, every six to eight hours, and that really should help kind of relax the muscles in the area, take off some of that tension, and really help with that pain if you're noticing that the rowbacks and still isn't helping. Maybe then we can start using like a heat pad, or maybe some icy hot the bio-freeze is a really good one to kind of help with that. And then we will refer you to physical therapy. I think with the MRI, we can start evaluating maybe some additional steps. So rather than you having to like take that fentanyl, because I don't want you to be in danger, right, like people I don't want you to get rubbed. So what we could explore are local injections, right, and we can refer you to pain, medication, and see about like locally injecting the area, and that should be able to help you out hopefully with this.
[patient]  I can't go to work like this.
[doctor]  Okay, so if it's if it's that bad, let's wait for the MRI result, we're going to give you off for work because you know you can't move and we'll see what the MRI says about what weather or not we can get you like true local injections in the moment is that all right for now.
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  Okay, okay, any other questions?
[patient]  Not right now.
[doctor]  Alright.","CHIEF COMPLAINT

aci,ACI009,"[doctor]  Hey Gregory, good to see you today. So take a look at my notes and I see that you're here. You've had a non-healing foot ulcer. So can you tell me how you're doing? How long have you had it? What's going on with it?
[patient]  Sure, so I've had it for about two months now, and it's recently become red and is draining so I was concerned about how it healed.
[doctor]  Okay, and when you when you got it would you have any trauma to your foot or it just just did it pop up all of a sudden?
[patient]  I think I may have gotten it from walking barefoot on the beach.
[doctor]  Okay, all right, and I saw you. You did see your PCP before you came and did they put you on antibiotics?
[patient]  They did star me on some medication, but I didn't I didn't pick them up from the pharmacy yet.
[doctor]  Okay, do you know which ones that they prescribed for you?
[patient]  I don't recall the name exactly.
[doctor]  Don't recall all right.
[patient]  Something I had taken it before.
[doctor]  Okay, so when you went beach did you go to when you heard it?
[patient]  I'm sorry.
[doctor]  So I was asking which beach did you did you go to when you hurt your foot?
[patient]  And I was a dewy beach in my ambulance.
[doctor]  Do-e beach while that sounds like fun. I wish I could be a ma- right now, but all or as lucky as I guess is you are to go to Do-e beach. Okay, so does it hurt.
[patient]  It's sometimes a throbs, doesn't I don't have specific pain, but sometimes it does feel like there is some throbbing going on. And again, my biggest concern is that it started a drain, and it looks a little red.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  I haven't had that before.
[doctor]  Okay, and that makes sense alright, so as far as your diabetes you know, and I think that's probably a major cause of this not being able to heal how well, our how well is that controlled.
[patient]  I take my medication, but I don't check my sugar all the time.
[doctor]  Okay, do you?
[patient]  I'm not really sure how.
[doctor]  Okay, do you know what your last A1c is? I'm pretty sure you dok talk to you about it.
[patient]  I think they told me it was around 10.
[doctor]  Around 10 okay. Yeah, that's definitely pretty high. Yeah, you definitely. If your PCP hasn't gotten created treatment plan for you definitely need to go back and see them so you can get that controlled. All right, so let me do a quick physical exam on your foot here today. Your vital signs look normal. You don't have a fever. So let me just take a look at your foot. So on your foot exam, there is a one by two inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot. So it's just proximal to the fifth empty P joint. There is some redness, some drainage present. You have some edema around it. There is fluid like you said that's coming out of it. I don't see any necrosis. You don't have any odor and I don't appreciate any bony exposure. So it pretty much is like you said it's red. It's swollen. I think you have an infection in there as well. So when I touch it does that hurt.
[patient]  No, I feel like increased pressure, but it's not distinct.
[doctor]  Okay, all right, that's good. So before you came and we did get an X-ray of your right foot, and there is no evidence of osteomyelitis that means that luckily you don't have a bone infection. So that's great. I think it's just in your skin. So let's talk a little bit about your assessment and plan. So you do have that diabetic foot ulcer. And what I want to do is I want to order an ABI ankle-break ill index just to determine the blood supply. In your foot to see if we can actually heal that ulcer, I'm going to also perform a debridement here just to take off some of that dead tissue. And then I'm going to prescribe you some clindamycin. You can do that 400 milligrams. You take that for seven days, take that twice a day just to try to get rid of that infection, which you currently do have. And that will get rid of some of that, that redness and end drainage that that's happening right now. Did your doc, did your PCP give you a surgical shoe, something that you would? Where, while this is happening.
[patient]  Didn't they mention that you may be able to give it to me?
[doctor]  Okay, yeah, we could definitely get you a shoe because if you wear your regular shoes that pressure on that foot can really irritate it and take you backwards. So I'll get you a shoe where you can wear that for the next month. You know, we just want to make sure that it does heal. And then I want to see you back again in two weeks and we can all possibly do another deraidment at that time. We'll just take a look and see how the tissue is doing. So how does that sound?
[patient]  That sounds great.
[doctor]  Alright, you have any other question?
[patient]  I do if anything happens in between.
[doctor]  Please feel free to call the office. Yeah, please feel free to call you call the office. We can definitely get you and you know if you are having any other issues. And if it's an emergency, if you feel like you're getting a fever feeling, well, please go to the urgent care or the ear if you feel getting black or anything like that. But otherwise, we'll see you back in two weeks.
[patient]  Okay, sounds great thanks document.

aci,ACI010,"[doctor]  Hi Michelle, what's been going on the medical assistant told me that you injured your knee?
[patient]  Yeah, I'm gonna have to keep this my favorite story is that I had a Sandra who injured her knee cold dancing. So that would immediately came up to mine. But let's try skiing. So I was skiing in Vermont last weekend and I caught my ski when I was coming off the lift and I fell on my knee popped and it's heard ever since.
[doctor]  Okay, and were you able to ski down the hill or did you have to be taken down by the ski patrol?
[patient]  I had to be taken down by the ski patrol. I was unable to bear weight.
[doctor]  Okay, isn't that slightly terrifying? They had to do the same thing for me. And you're just kind of sitting there watching all of the trees go by. So anyway, so what part of your knee is bothering you the most? Is it the inside, the outside?
[patient]  It hurts on the outside, but it also feels like it won't hold my weight.
[doctor]  Okay, so it feels like it's gonna buckle.
[patient]  Mías
[doctor]  Okay, alright, and are you able to bend it?
[patient]  I was immediately after the injury, but not really now.
[doctor]  Okay, and how about straightening? It are you able to straighten it at all?
[patient]  somewhat, but it really hurts when I try to straighten all the way.
[doctor]  Okay, all right now do you have any numbing or tingling in your toes?
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Okay, and can you feel your toes okay?
[patient]  I think so.
[doctor]  Okay, all right now. Are you a pretty active person you said you were skiing? Do you do what kind of other activities do you do?
[patient]  I chased my two four year old.
[doctor]  Okay, do you have twins?
[patient]  I do.
[doctor]  Nice, that's great.
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  So, okay. And what's your support like at home who is who is able to help out are you still doing that kind of hobbling around on crutches or...
[patient]  And now my husband is home with me, but he also works a job where he's gone quite a bit. So it's just me and the kids.
[doctor]  Okay, all right, and did the ski patrol give you crutches? I see you have them here with you, okay? All right, great. And are you otherwise generally healthy?
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  Okay, and no high blood pressure diabetes, anything like that.
[patient]  MM
[doctor]  No, okay, all right. And while I want to go ahead, let me just do a quick physical exam. I'm going to be calling out some of my exam findings. And I'll let you know what that means when I'm done, okay? All right, so on your hard exam, your heart sounds in a nice regular rate. And rhythm, I don't appreciate any murmur on your lung exam, your lungs are nice and clear to osculation. And remind me what need to do in jur again.
[patient]  My right knee.
[doctor]  Your right knee okay, so on your right knee examination I do appreciate some edema and an effusion over the right knee does it hurt when I press.
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  Okay, there is pain to palpation of the right lateral knee, there is decreased flexion, and extension there is a positive lockman sign, there is a palpable palpable dorsalus pedus, and posterior tibial pulse, there is no legadema in the ankle okay. Well, let's just talk a little bit about you know my assessment, and you know my plan for you. So you know I know that you had the x-ray done of your of your right knee that didn't show any bony. Abnormality, but I am concerned that you have ruptured your ear. ACL, or your anterior cruciate ligament that's like a major ligament that helps connect and helps your knee move back and forth. So I want to go ahead and order a knee MRI just so that we can get a a good look and just you know confirm that physical exam. Okay, now some people can have a normal physical exam, and their ACL can still be torn, but you do have a lot of pain on the lateral aspect of your knee, so I want to make sure if they're make sure that there is not any other structures that have been damaged by this accident. Okay, I want to go ahead and you know are you what are you taking for the pain?
[patient]  I be profan.
[doctor]  Is that helping?
[patient]  somewhat yes
[doctor]  Okay, alright, do you want something stronger?
[patient]  No, I'm okay.
[doctor]  All right, so let's just continue with ibuprofen. You can take, you know, 600 to 800 milligrams every eight hours as needed. I want to go ahead and put you in a brace that's going to help your knee feel a bit more supported. Okay. And let's go ahead. And I'm hoping that we can get this MRI done and you know the next couple days. And then we can have a conversation about what needs to be done now. You said that you are, you know, obviously a very active, active mom, any other exercise or anything else that that I should be aware of that you do just wondering in terms of which kind of graft we would use to fix this with your ACL being injured.
[patient]  No, I'm not sure I would like to get back to the running, but currently not that active.
[doctor]  Okay, alright, alright. Do you have any questions about anything?
[patient]  I think you've explained it well.
[doctor]  Okay, alright, so I'll see you again soon, okay.
[patient]  Okay, thank you.
[doctor]  Alright take care bye.","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Right knee injury

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Michelle King is a pleasant 44-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of a right knee injury. Her injury was sustained while skiing in Vermont last weekend after she caught her ski when coming off of the lift and fell. She reports a pop in her knee at the time of injury and has been experiencing pain since that time. Due to her fall she was unable to weight bear and had to be taken down by the ski patrol. She locates her pain to the lateral aspect of her knee and also describes the feeling of instability as well as buckling. At this time she is experiencing difficulty with knee flexion; however, she states this was not a problem immediately after the injury. Full knee extension is also quite painful for her. The patient denies any numbness or tingling in her toes. She is currently utilizing crutches for ambulation which were provided to her by the ski patrol. In terms of pain control, she is taking ibuprofen which is providing some relief.

MEDICAL HISTORY

Patient reports she is otherwise healthy and denies a history of high blood pressure or diabetes.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient reports she is very active with skiing and taking care of her 4-year-old twins. She mentions that she would like to get back into running at some point. She states that her husband is home with her, but he also works a job where he has gone quite a bit.

MEDICATIONS

Patient reports she is taking ibuprofen.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports right knee pain and limited range of motion.
Neurological: Denies numbness or tingling in toes.

PHYSICAL EXAM

GAIT: The patient is ambulating with crutches.
CV: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmur.
RESPIRATORY: Lungs are clear to auscultation.
MSK: Examination of the right knee: Edema and effusion noted. Pain with palpation of the lateral knee. Decreased flexion and extension. Positive Lachman's. Palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulse. No ankle edema.

RESULTS

4 views of the right knee were taken today. These reveal no bony abnormalities.

ASSESSMENT

Right knee pain, possible ACL tear.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to her current symptoms. I have recommended that we obtain an MRI of the right knee to evaluate for a possible ACL tear. In the meantime, I have advised her to continue taking ibuprofen 600 to 800 mg every 8 hours as needed for pain. She will also be placed into a brace for increased knee support.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me once the MRI results are available for review and further discussion."
aci,ACI015,"[doctor]  Hey William, so I see that you injured your knee could you tell me a bit about what happened.
[patient]  Yeah, I thought it was a good idea to go to the trampoline park with my wife and her to snap an instant pain when I was on the trampoline.
[doctor]  Okay, alright, and so, do you go to the trampoline park often?
[patient]  I don't and I think that's the issue.
[doctor]  Okay, so this is the first time you'd ever done something like that.
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  Okay, all right, I just want to get like a few more details. Do you like workout regularly? Was this for fun or for like an exercise class?
[patient]  No, it's just for fun.
[doctor]  Okay, and do you have a regular exercise regimen at all?
[patient]  Try not consistent with it.
[doctor]  Okay, no that's fine, this is not a place of judgment. I just am just trying to understand like, if a little bit more of the background okay, so we went to the trampoline park which, Nihwa, did you hurt?
[patient]  My ride.
[doctor]  Okay, you're right knee and so based on like you're inside and outside which part hurts more.
[patient]  It's kind of the outside of the knee.
[doctor]  Alright, so the lateral aspect not a problem, and you said that you heard a pop when you landed right.
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  Okay, have you taken anything for the pain?
[patient]  Just Tylenol.
[doctor]  Alright so did the Tylenol help.
[patient]  Not really.
[doctor]  Okay, alright, and so, someone doesn't have you tried anything else like, did you ice it use heat anything like that?
[patient]  No, I just kind of elevated it and that was about it.
[doctor]  Okay, that's fine and how long ago did this happen?
[patient]  A week ago.
[doctor]  Okay, alright, so you put up with the paint for a week. That's I'm proud of you for that.
[patient]  I don't like to come to the doctors.
[doctor]  Excuse me, I feel rejected right now. Why would you say something like that? It's fine. But you know, I like it when you're not here either because that means that you're doing a good job. So let's see about like getting your knee fixed up, but I want to talk about some of the other issues that you have first. So we know that you have hypertension, right? And I discussed maybe getting a blood pressure cuff because I needed you to measure those a bit more regularly. Did you get the cuff?
[patient]  What know?
[doctor]  No, okay, that's fine. Have you measured your blood pressure recently at all?
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Okay are you still taking your medication because I see you're on 20 milligrams of lysinoprol?
[patient]  Your most days I remember.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  All right, I'm not suspicious, but we're just going to go with that. Okay, because looking at your vitals, it is still a bit high. I'm not really comfortable. I see like 180 over, you know, 80 and
[doctor]  That's not where we want to be. So I wonder if we might need to adjust your medication, but let's talk about your diabetes. How are your blood sugars?
[patient]  I think they're a little bit better.
[doctor]  Okay, what makes you think that have you been taking them?
[patient]  Yeah, I check it, you know, most days again, kind of when I remember.
[doctor]  Okay, how often are you checking it?
[patient]  I would say 4-5 times a week.
[doctor]  Okay, you might want to switch to maybe two or three times a day, but you know that's something I'm glad that you are measuring are you taking your metformin?
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  Okay, and then I think we have you on 500 milligrams correct.
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  Alright, how is your diet?
[patient]  kind of the same as my exercise decent could be better.
[doctor]  All right, and okay, not a problem. So what is your, do you, are you measuring your calories at all looking at your macros? Are you just eating what you feel like?
[patient]  It's just trying to watch what I eat more than anything, but nothing specific.
[doctor]  Okay, and are you do know if you're particularly focused on your salt like, is it like a low salt diet?
[patient]  Now just try to watch my car a little bit more, but not counting or anything.
[doctor]  Alright, so like, is it a specific diet? I just want to make sure like, are you on like the keto diet?
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Okay, all right, not a problem. So if you don't mind, I'm going to go ahead and do a quick physical exam as I mentioned before your blood pressure is a little high as I listen to your heart, I do like it's got a nice regular rate. And rhythm, I don't appreciate any murmur when I listen to your lungs, they sound clear bilaterally. I would like to look at your knee though, so when I press here on the outside, does it hurt?
[patient]  Little bit.
[doctor]  Okay, and then when I press on the inside does it hurt?
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Alright, can you bend your knee and straighten it?
[patient]  How can I think that's all I can I can bend?
[doctor]  Hmm, alright so are you having problems walking? Can you bear wait?
[patient]  I can, but I have a little bit of a limp.
[doctor]  Okay, so do you mind getting up and walking for me really quickly? All right, so I do notice that there is a slight gate like there is a small sorry you are correcting you. Do you have a limp eye? I am a little worried about that, but it's probably it's probably the superficial. When I'm looking at your knee, I do notice some like echamosis and a dima that just means bruising and swelling along the lateral aspect of your knee. I don't notice any effusion and it looks like you have a decent range of motion, but I do understand that you know you're experiencing pain with some movement. Okay, I'm going to go ahead and order an x-ray and when you come back we can have that discussion all right. So I reviewed the results of your right knee x-ray which showed no evidence of fracture or bony abnormality. So let's talk about my assessment and plan all right. So for your first problem of right knee pain, I think you have a lateral ligament strain I want to prescribe some eloxicam, which is going to be 15 milligrams daily for pain and swelling. I'm going to refer you to physical therapy to help strengthen the muscles around the area and to prevent further injury if you're still having pain, we can do further imaging imaging, but like this is a common injury that tends to heal on its own for your second problem with hypertension. I want to continue the Lyceinipril at 20 milligrams and order an echo. I am concerned that we might not be getting your blood pressure to where we need it to be. So we might have to do some medication modification for your third problem with diabetes. I want to order an a1c I know that you said you have been measuring your blood sugars, but I think this would give us a better image of what's been happening long term and I also want to order a lipid panel in case we need to make any adjustments to that medication as well. Do you have any questions?
[patient]  Sounds good.
[doctor]  Alright, awesome.","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Right knee injury.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

William Russell is a pleasant 57-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of a right knee injury. He has a past medical history significant for hypertension and type 2 diabetes.

Approximately 1 week ago, the patient sustained an injury to his right knee while at a trampoline park. He explains that he was jumping on a trampoline when he heard a snap, followed by instant pain in the lateral aspect of his knee. This is not a common activity for him, and he admits that he is inconsistent with exercise. As far as treatment, he has been elevating his knee and taking Tylenol without significant relief of his pain. He has not tried applying heat or ice to the area.

In terms of his hypertension, the patient admits that he did not purchase a blood pressure cuff as previously recommended. While he does not monitor his blood pressures at home, he has been compliant with lisinopril 20 mg.

His diabetes appears to be stable based on home monitoring, although he is only checking his blood glucose levels 4 to 5 times per week. He does not follow any specific diet plan, but he does try to make healthier choices such as limiting his carbohydrate intake. He has also been taking his metformin 500 mg as prescribed.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports right knee pain.

VITALS

Blood pressure: 180/80 mmHg

PHYSICAL EXAM

CV: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs.
RESPIRATORY:
Lungs are clear bilaterally.
MSK: Examination of the right knee: Mild tenderness to palpation at the lateral aspect. Ecchymosis and edema along the lateral aspect. No effusion. Decent range of motion. Pain with movement.

RESULTS

X-rays of the right knee were obtained and reviewed. These reveal no evidence of fracture or bony abnormality.

ASSESSMENT

1. Right knee pain, lateral ligament strain.
2. Hypertension.
3. Diabetes type 2.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, his symptoms appear to be consistent with a lateral ligament strain of the right knee. I am going to prescribe meloxicam 15 mg once daily for pain and swelling. I also put in a referral for physical therapy so he can work on strengthening the muscles around the area and prevent any further injury. We can consider further imaging if he continues to have pain, but I explained that this is a common injury that typically heals on it's own.

For his hypertension, I'm concerned that his blood pressure is not well controlled at this time, so we may need to modify his medication. I'm going to order an echocardiogram for further evaluation, but I want him to continue taking his lisinopril 20 mg for now.

For his diabetes, he stated that he has been measuring his blood glucose levels 4 to 5 times per week, but I want him to start measuring them 2 to 3 times per day. His hemoglobin A1c levels should provide more detail as far as his long-term progress so we will order that today. I'm also going to order a lipid panel and we can determine if any adjustments need to be made to his medication. In the meantime, he should continue taking metformin 500 mg.
"
aci,ACI017,"[patient]  Hi Kenneth, how are you, the medical assistant told me that you had some knee pain? Yeah, I was getting ready for the holiday weekend and I was out on my boat skiing and I did a jump and kind of twisted when I landed and my knee has been hurting me ever since.
[doctor]  Okay, so that was about five days ago then.
[patient]  Yeah, yeah, that was last weekend.
[doctor]  Last weekend okay, now which knee is it?
[patient]  It's my right knee.
[doctor]  You're right knee okay and I know that it sounds like you were on a motorboat as you were you know water skiing but did you hear anything pop or feel anything pop when it happened
[patient]  No, it just felt like something stretched, and then it swelled up some afterwards.
[doctor]  Okay, and were you I assume that you were were you able to get out of the water by yourself or did you need some assistance?
[patient]  I was it would get out but it was very sort of climb up and you know any kind of squatting or bending is really pretty sore.
[doctor]  Yeah, okay, and have you ever injured this knee before?
[patient]  No, that was the first time.
[doctor]  That was the first time, okay. Where do you have a boat? What lake do you have it on lake?
[patient]  Lake Martin.
[doctor]  Okay, nice, and so your frequent water skier.
[patient]  Yeah, I try to go every weekend when we can.
[doctor]  That's nice, very, very good. Are you looking forward to spring? Are you a baseball fan? Are you excited? By opening day?
[patient]  No, I'm not a baseball fan, but I love spring and chicken time of year lawns of outdoor activities. Nice, nice. I'm not really a baseball fan either, but my husband makes me watch to the meds all the time, and they lose all the time. So he is always upset. So, so anyway.
[doctor]  Yeah right, so how about your high blood pressure? How are you doing with that? Are you taking your blood pressure medication? Like I asked.
[patient]  I'm taking it every day and I check my blood pressure at home and it's been about 125 over 80 most of the days.
[doctor]  Nice okay, so I believe we have you on liciniprol about 20 milligrams a day, any side effects from that that you're noticing.
[patient]  Not that I know of it's been a good medicine for me, and I don't have any trouble with it.
[doctor]  Okay great alright and since you had this knee pain any numbing or tingling in your foot at all
[patient]  No, just the swelling in the pain.
[doctor]  Okay, and what have you taken for the paint?
[patient]  I took some leave twice a day, some over the counter a leave twice a day.
[doctor]  Okay, and...
[patient]  putting a cool pack on it.
[doctor]  Okay, and how's that helped at all?
[patient]  Yet it's helped a fair amount, it's still pretty sore though.
[doctor]  Okay, all right, well let's see have you ever had any surgeries before. Let me just think any surgeries I don't see any in your in your record here.
[patient]  I have my tonsils out.
[doctor]  Okay, you had your tonsils out, okay? All right, well, let me go ahead. I want to do it just a quick physical exam. I'm going to go ahead and be calling out some of my clinical exam findings. And I'll let you know what that means when I'm done, okay? So looking at your vital signs here in the office, it just looked like you're doing a really good job managing your blood pressure, your blood pressure is up, is about 120 over 77 today herein. The office. And that's with you probably in a little bit of pain. So that's good. And on your neck exam, I don't appreciate any lymphedentipathy on your heart exam, your heart is a nice regular rate. And rhythm, I don't appreciate any murmur on your lung exam, your lungs are clear to osculation bilaterally on your musculoskeletal exam. On your right knee, I do appreciate some echinosis, some edema. There is an effusion present as it hurt when I press.
[patient]  Yeah, that's sore.
[doctor]  Okay, there is pain to palpation of the right medial knee. There is undisclined bend your knee in all sorts of directions. Here does that hurt.
[patient]  You don't do that anymore.
[doctor]  All right, the patient has decreased range of motion. There is a negative varus and balgastus. There is a negative lockman sign. There is a palpable dorsalus pedus and posterior tibial pulse. There is otherwise no lower extremity edema. So what does that mean? Kenneth, so that means that you essentially I agree with you. You had quite quite an injury to your knee and you do have a little bit of fluid in your knee there and just some inflammation, which I think we need to talk about. Okay, so I want to go ahead and just talk a little bit about, you know, my assessment and my plan for you. So for your first problem of your right knee pain, I do believe you have what we call a a medial collateral ligament strain. You know, I want to go ahead and just order an X-ray of your right knee just to make sure that we're not missing any broken bones, which I don't think we are. But what's good about this particular injury is that people typically heal quite well from this and they typically don't need surgery. We can just go ahead and refer you to physical therapy to strengthen those muscles around your knee so that you don't have another injury. And I want to go ahead and just prescribe meloxicam 15 milligrams once a day and that will help take down the swelling and help with some of the pain. And you only have to take it once a day and it won't really cause any upset stomach or anything like that. Do you have any questions about that?
[patient]  Yeah, if I start that medicine today, I'm not going to be able to ski tomorrow because we got a big weekend plan.
[doctor]  I would say I would like you to rest your knee. I think that my concern is that if you go skiing again and you fall that you might injure your knee even more. So I think you'll recover from this injury right now but I don't want you to injure it anymore. So I would rest it for a little while at least until we have the results of the X-ray and that type of thing okay for your second problem of your hypertension. I want to just go ahead and continue on Lycinoprol 20 milligrams a day. I want to just go ahead and order an ellipid panel just to make sure everything is okay from that standpoint and then I'm just looking through your health record and it looks like you're due for a tetanus shot. So we'll go ahead and just give you a a tetanus shot from a health maintenance perspective any other questions.
[patient]  I think so sounded good planned to me.
[doctor]  Okay sounds good alright so I'll see you later we'll get those ordered and I'll be in touch okay take care bye
[patient]  Thank you.","CHIEF COMPLAINT

aci,ACI024,"[doctor]  Hey Matthew, I see here that you've had some back pain for a while and your PCP sent you over to see me how are you doing today?
[patient]  Pretty good, I'm feeling pretty good. Don't like the weather, you know, I've been sitting in the waiting area for, you know, 30 minutes. And that definitely makes the symptoms worse.
[doctor]  Okay, well first of all I agree with you the weather has kind of been all over the place been hot and been cold and and and now it seems like we've had a week of pretty chilly weather hopefully that changes pretty soon so tell me a little bit about when when your back pain started and and what happened there.
[patient]  Well, you want to hear the long story or kind of the short story because my back has been bothering me for a long time.
[doctor]  So, let's do the readers digest a version.
[patient]  Well, I can't really tie my shoes, you know, standing really makes it bad, you know, when I go to them all, it really, really, I don't know all I've just been bettered in.
[doctor]  Okay, and I know it got real bad about a month ago that's what the report here from the PCP said, but can you tell me exactly where the pain is in your lower back? Can you kind of point to where that's at?
[patient]  It's right here and you know like 30 years ago when I fell off the roof, it was really, really bothersome. They said maybe there was a fracture or something and you know I don't know I just couldn't play football and then I had to you know kind of try to take care of myself but you know it's been really bad for about a month.
[doctor]  Okay, and then do still have that pain that radiates down your left leg sometimes.
[patient]  Yeah, of course, yeah, it goes all the way through here.
[doctor]  Okay, and then so it looks like you pointed to your lower back area and then pointed down through your hip and down into your to your left leg. Can you describe that pain for me?
[patient]  It's like an electrical tooth ache and it goes down the whole leg.
[doctor]  Okay, and can you rate that pain for me? Right now, zero being none ten being the worst pain you've ever been in in your life.
[patient]  Right now it's less bad I didn't take my medications because I wanted you to see me as as I am, but it's six out of ten, but when it gets really bad, I'd say it's thirteen out of ten.
[doctor]  Okay, and anything that you do make it feel better you mentioned that you know sometimes sitting or laying down anything that make that better.
[patient]  Y'all like I said that the only thing that seems to make it better is laying down.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  You know, standing walking seems to make it worse, coughing, sneezing makes it worse. And, you know, I had a friend that saw you and you know, you burned some nerves or something like that. And so, I was just seeing if there was something that you could do to get me out of this pain and hopefully you could do it today.
[doctor]  Okay, and then any numbness or tingling in in your lower extremities or any weakness there in your legs.
[patient]  You know what it's my back that's weak and my legs are weak. Both of them, you know coughing sneezing seem to make it worse. So sorry. I'm just trying to be like a typical patient because most patients they don't answer the darn questions. So you know all this time I still haven't gotten a chief complain out of them. So I love the way that you're trying to redirect. And so you know what your doctor said you had back pain and leg pain. But for me, the most important thing for me to capture is that it's in the hip side of the leg side of the calf goes to the big toe. And so I need them to be able to give me a perfect sort of root signature. So I can hone in is that four five diss seen on the MRI really significant or is it on the opposite side? But again, I'm sorry. I'm purposely trying to be in a difficult patient because some of these patients, he asked them 50 different questions. They won't answer any of them. So anyway, sorry about well.
[doctor]  That's okay.
[patient]  to explain, but this is what I deal with every single day.
[doctor]  Absolutely.
[patient]  A lot of pain, you know, what my pain is eight out of ten, it goes in the back, goes into the hip side of the leg side of the calf, goes to the big toe of my foot, kind of drags. When I walk, I've been having to use a cane. Nothing seems to make it better. But very few patients will give you the perfect history, and most people will start talking about you know when something happened or go back to 30 years ago, and you want to redirect them to their current. Symptom, but the patients won't rarely ever. Tell you what the chief complaint is you got to pull out of them.
[doctor]  So let's take a quick look at you here, okay? Let's do a physical exam real quick. So your vitals look good, which is a good thing now in your back exam. I don't see any bony abnormalities, no redness, or no, and no bruising present now. Do you have pain when I press here?
[patient]  No it's right here.
[doctor]  Okay, so positive for pain to palpation at the L4 vertebrae. And if you bend forward, do you have pain there?
[patient]  It hurts all the time, especially sitting in these run office desks.
[doctor]  Okay, so you are positive for pain with flexion and extension of your back. I'm going to go ahead and test the strength of your legs now. Push out against my hands for me, please.
[patient]  Okay, that's it, that's all I got.
[doctor]  Alright, so 4 out of 5 strength in the left and 5 out of 5 on the right just look like that reflexes are brisk and motor, and sensory is intact in both lower extremities. I do want to review the results of your MRI. The MRI shows a disc herniation at the level of L4L5 vertebrae, and it is associated with some nerve-route impingement, and what that means is the nerve is being compressed by that herniation, so let me tell you a little bit about my assessment, and plan, okay, so for the diagnosis. Of a acute disc herniation at L4L5 with that nerve-route impingement that's causing that pain down your leg and your lower back pain, now I know you've tried NSI DS in the past without relief, and you've done some point. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to recommend an epidural steroid injection, and we're going to do that today for you. If you agree to it, what that means is going to place some anti-inflammatory medication, right? At the spot of inflammation, and once that's in place, I want to refer you back to. Point, and we want to strengthen that area, I'm K, you're young, and otherwise healthy. I think you'll do well, but it can take about two to three weeks for that injection really to take full effect, so then I want you to see point, and I want you to see me again in about a month, are you okay with that treatment plan?
[patient]  Sure sounds good.
[doctor]  All right, sounds good. I'm going to have the nurse come in and get you prepped and then we'll get that injection for you.","HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Matthew Hill is a pleasant 44-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of back pain. The patient was referred from his primary care physician. The onset of his pain began 30 years ago, when he fell off of a roof. He endorses that it was very bothersome and he was unable to play football. He states that he was told that he may have a fracture at that time. The patient reports that his pain has worsened 1 month ago. He locates his pain to his lower back, which radiates into his left hip, down his left leg, on the side of his calf, and into his left big toe. The patient describes his pain as an ""electrical tooth ache"" that radiates down his entire left leg. He notes that he has to use a cane to walk as his left foot drags when he walks. He rates his pain level as a 6 to 8 out of 10, however it can get to a 13 out of 10 at its worst. He states that he did not take any medication before his appointment so it did not affect his pain during our visit. The patient notes that he was in the waiting room for 30 minutes today and states that it made his symptoms worse. His pain is aggravated by standing, ambulating, coughing, and sneezing. The patient states that he is unable to tie his shoes secondary to the pain. The patient states that his pain is alleviated by lying down. He also reports weakness in his bilateral legs and his back. The patient denies any numbness or tingling. The patient has attempted NSAIDs in the past without relief. He has also attended physical therapy.

PHYSICAL EXAM

CONSTITUTIONAL: Vitals look good.
MSK: Examination of the lumbar spine: No bony abnormalities. No redness. No bruising present. Pain with palpation at the L4 vertebrae. Positive for pain with flexion and extension of the back. 4/5 strength on the left, 5/5 strength on the right. Reflexes are brisk. Motor and sensory are intact throughout the bilateral lower extremities.

RESULTS

The MRI of the lumbar spine was reviewed today. It revealed a disc herniation at the level of the L4-5 vertebrae. It is associated with some nerve root impingement.

ASSESSMENT

Acute disc herniation at L4-5 with nerve root impingement.

PLAN

I have recommended that we treat the patient conservatively with a epidural steroid injection and formal physical therapy. With the patient's consent, we will proceed with a epidural steroid injection into the lumbar spine today. He will follow up with me in 4 weeks to check on his progress."
aci,ACI033,"[patient]  Miss Edwards is here for evaluation of facial pain. This is a 54 year old male.
[doctor]  How are you doing Dr. Cruz nice to see you today?
[patient]  Good to see you, Mr. Edwards, I'm Doctor.
[doctor]  Tell me what's been going on yet, so I've got the stabbing shooting pain I've had for a while you know and it had especially right here in my right face right in that cheekbone area. It's sometimes it gets super hot I've had it for I think a couple of months now and I went to my family doctor and they said I should come see you.
[patient]  Okay, great. I would like to ask you a little bit more about that.
[doctor]  How in your face do you remember how long that you had it probably for about two or three months just just came on slowly? I started noticing it, but now it's I have episodes where just shooting stabbing kind of a pain in my right cheekbone right face area.
[patient]  Emimhm, do you have any sensory loss meaning like numbness or tingling in that part of your face?
[doctor]  Not that I've noticed. No, okay. Do you have any symptoms like this anywhere else on your face, including the other side of your face?
[patient]  No, it's just on the right side, mostly not on the left side, just on the right side of my face.
[doctor]  Have you noticed any weakness on that side of the face like when you smile? Or, while you're doing other things any weakness, they're not really. I mean, I've tried to know when I smile, my smile seems equal on both sides. My eyes, I don't have any weakness. Their my vision seems to be unchanged. But just the stabbing severe pain, it's just like excruciating pain that I get sometimes does it happen on its own. Or there are certain things that trigger it.
[patient]  Sometimes if I'm of certain temperatures seem to trigger it sometimes or if it's super where it's cold I get triggered sometimes.
[doctor]  Sometimes certain kind of sensory outside of the wind, sometimes that seems to trigger it, but that's about it.
[patient]  Okay, and anything that you've done to that helps for a little bit when you.
[doctor]  Pain Excess.
[patient]  You know, I've tried ibuprofen and motrin that had really hasn't helped it just comes on suddenly and then it's kind of stabbing, excruciating pain. I've tried rubbing some, you know, some tiger balm on it that didn't work.
[doctor]  But that's, you know, so I went to my family doctor and he said, you know, I really need to see a neurosurgeon.
[patient]  Gotta how long do these episodes last these pain.
[doctor]  You know it can last for anywhere from a few minutes to sometimes about an hour, but generally, generally a few minutes.
[patient]  Any history of something like multiple sclerosis or any brain tumors that you know?
[doctor]  No nothing like that. I'll write any other kind of headache symptoms that have anything like you had migraines or anything related to the headaches. I mean, I get occasional headaches, but not really I don't have a history of migraines, but I occasionally get headaches like everybody else. I take some Tylenol that usually goes away, but this is different.
[patient]  How severe is the pain on a scale of 1 to 10?
[doctor]  When it comes on, it's like a 10, it's like somebody is stabbing you with an ice pick, and but usually you know after a few minutes, usually it goes away. But sometimes it can last up to an hour great. So, Mr. I would like to do a physical exam if that's okay with you.
[patient]  Sure.
[doctor]  I would like you to follow my finger here and I see that you're following my finger in in both directions. Can you show me your teeth?
[patient]  That looks nice and symmetric. I'm going to rub my fingers next to your ear. Can you hear that?
[doctor]  Yep.
[patient]  You can hear it on the other side as well.
[doctor]  Yep.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  I'm going to take this cotton tape and run it along the side of your face. Can you feel that okay?
[patient]  It's a little bit numb on my right side, not so much on my left side.
[doctor]  Okay, alright, I'm going to use this little needle here and I'm going to poke here and I want to see if you feel like it's being sharp or dull on that part of your face. Does that feel different or normal?
[patient]  It feels a little bit dull on my left, on my right side, my left side. It feels sharp.
[doctor]  Alright good, well I had a chance to look at your MRI.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  And I look to your MRI and it appears to have small blood vessel that is a budding and perhaps even pinching the trigeminal nerve, the trigeminal nerve is nerve that comes from the brain stem that goes out to the face and provides the sensory inflammation from the face. And you may have a condition called trigeminal neuralgia.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  where the nerve compression causes this kind of shooting electrical pain. In the face, how do we treat it?
[patient]  While the first line would be to try some medications, usually we start with medications that are called GABA PINN.
[doctor]  or tegritol these are medications that really help reduce the excitability of the nerve.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Most people can get the pain control with that, but there are some people where the medications aren't going to be enough, and in that situation we would consider surgery, I wouldn't I wouldn't recommend that now we usually try the medications first.
[patient]  for considering a surgery to decompress the nerve the root cause of the problem is the compression of the blood vessel against the nerve.
[doctor]  Okay, so we should be tried which one would you recommend the tegritol? Or yeah, I think we could start with the tegritol. To start with, I just want to make sure that you understand some of the potential side effects that you can have with this.
[patient]  Sure.
[doctor]  It's always a little bit of trial and error to figure out what the right dosing that would work for you. But some common side effects can include, you know, memory loss tingling and balance. Some people can actually have, like, dermatologic.
[patient]  skin reaction to this medication and particularly people who have you staking descent so that we may do some genetic testing just to make sure that it will be safe for you.
[doctor]  Okay, sounds good. Let's do it.
[patient]  Okay, so I will prescribe that for you, and then we will see how that goes. And if your pain continues, we can talk about different surgical options to treat the pain.
[doctor]  Yeah, I think I would like to try the Tegritall first, and if that doesn't work then I can come back. And so, one should I come back, and just to kind of check back with you, and see if you know if it's had enough time for a fact or not.
[patient]  I think one month would be a great time to follow up.
[doctor]  Okay, sounds good. So if you want to send that prescription over my pharmacy, that would be fine. And then why don't I come back in about a month and we'll go from there?
[patient]  Great, I'll see you then.
[doctor]  Alright.","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Right-sided facial pain.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Eyes: Denies vision changes or weakness in right eye.
HENT: Reports right sided facial pain. Denies left sided facial pain. Neurological: Reports headaches. Denies sensory loss, numbness, or tingling in the right cheek. Denies right sided facial weakness.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Neurological
- Orientation: Light touch testing of the right side of the face reveals numbness when compared to the contralateral side. Pinprick testing is sharp on the left side of the face; dull on the right side of the face.

Ears, Nose, Mouth, and Throat
Bilateral finger rub test is negative.
- Examination of Mouth: Teeth are symmetric.

RESULTS

MRI of the head is reviewed today. This demonstrates a small blood vessel that is abutting, and perhaps even pinching, the right trigeminal nerve.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Trigeminal neuralgia.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient has been experiencing facial pain for 2 to 3 months. A recent MRI revealed a small blood vessel abutting, or perhaps even pinching, the right trigeminal nerve. The root cause of his facial pain is the compression of the blood vessel against this nerve.
- Patient Education and Counseling: The patient and I discussed treatment options including medicating with gabapentin or Tegretol. I explained the common side effects associated with these medications can include memory loss, tingling, and imbalance. We discussed the need for genetic testing due to the possible side effect of dermatologic reactions in people of East Asian descent. We also briefly discussed surgical treatment to decompress the nerve, but this is not recommended at this time.
- Medical Treatment: A prescription for Tegretol will be sent to the patient’s pharmacy.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me in 1 month. If at that time his facial pain persists, we may further discuss surgical options."
aci,ACI043,"[doctor]  Hey Betty, how are you doing?
[patient]  I'm doing okay. I've just been really frustrated because with my asthma, and it just seems like I can never catch a break, never get better. I'm always, it seems like I'm always coughing and wheezing.
[doctor]  I'm sorry to hear that what normally triggers your asmetype symptoms.
[patient]  I find it's really really when I get sick if I get sick with a cold. I almost always know that my asthma is gonna flare. I did notice one time though that when I went to my aunt's house, I had a flare afterwards and I think it's because of her cat. So I try to avoid going there and I haven't really had an issue since.
[doctor]  Okay, so now you mentioned that that happens somewhat a lot how frequently does this occur that you have these breathing type problems.
[patient]  It seems like it happens really every month or every other month of the past six months. I usually end up going to urgent care a lot and get my primary care doctor. And so sometimes they'll give me antibiotics. Sometimes I'll get steroids one time. It was so bad I actually ended up going to the emergency department.
[doctor]  Wow, that can be a little bit scary. So you mentioned that your primary care provider or the urgent care provider gave you medications. What medications are you using for your asthma right now?
[patient]  I have two inhalers one, but I really just use one of them. It's a blue one. It seems like the only inhaler that helps me the other one. When I try to use it, it doesn't work.
[doctor]  Okay, so do you think that's the Albuterol inhaler? Is it do you remember the name like Ventilin or?
[patient]  Yes, yes, that's the name of it.
[doctor]  Is that okay? Alright. And then how often do you feel like you need to use that?
[patient]  I would say like almost every day, I feel like I'm using my inhaler because I'm always coughing and wheezing and a couple of times a night. I'll wake up as a couple of times a week, I'll end up waking up needing to use my inhaler as well.
[doctor]  Okay, and then when you use it, at that time does it help.
[patient]  It does.
[doctor]  Okay, and how many walk me through how you use that you just wake up and you take one puff or is it two puffs?
[patient]  Yeah, I take I usually take two paths.
[doctor]  Okay, but then you get enough relief that you can go back to sleep.
[patient]  Yeah, for the most part.
[doctor]  Okay, now have you ever needed to be hospitalized? Due to your asthma symptoms, you mentioned you've had to go to the ER.
[patient]  Yeah, for only once I can think of when I was young, I think like around eight years old. I had to be hospitalized, but nothing since then.
[doctor]  Okay, I do want to take a little bit of a deeper dive here into your ear and urgent care visits. Can you tell me a little bit more about those?
[patient]  Yeah, I feel like I've had several. I don't remember the exact number, but I've had several this past year. They almost always have to start me on Prednisone.
[doctor]  Okay, like a prednisone taper pack that type of thing.
[patient]  Yeah, sometimes they'll just give me like a large dose over five days.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  And then sometimes they make me take less and less and less, so the over like nine or ten days.
[doctor]  Okay so both the dose back and then also the high dose as well okay.
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  And then when was your last exacerbation?
[patient]  Probably about a month ago.
[doctor]  Okay, so just out of curiosity, you mentioned that you have trouble when you go over to your aunt's house because of your cat now, I see here that you really like to go outside and walk and do those type of things. Do you have any other type of issues whenever you go outside, any any seasonal allergies or anything like that?
[patient]  No, not really.
[doctor]  Okay, so you don't have any history of seasonal allergies, which is good. So it looks like here that you put down that you enjoyed hiking, so you don't have any trouble getting out and going hiking, and have you tried the new trails there behind, behind the rec center.
[patient]  Yeah, I'm really excited, I mean I have to be careful because I know with my coughing, my wheezing, but I'm really looking forward to getting better, so I can really start hiking again.
[doctor]  Okay, now I really need you to be truthful when you answer these next questions. This is important for taking a good history. Do you smoke any type of cigarette or tobacco product and have you ever smoked or do smoke marijuana on a regular basis?
[patient]  No, I've never smoked and I don't vape either or yeah, don't smoke cigarettes from marijuana.
[doctor]  Okay, and then you said you don't vape, so no vaping or e-cigarette use it all.
[patient]  Hmm.
[doctor]  Okay, and then are you routinely in an area where there is a lot of airborne particular like smoking in bars or around any type of a, you know, like racetracks or anything like that?
[patient]  Sometimes I go to the bars with some friends, and yeah, the smoking does irritate me.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  So, I'm going to try to go there often.
[doctor]  Okay, thank you for sharing that with me, so if it's okay with you, I'd like to go ahead and do a quick physical exam.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Now I reviewed your vitals for today, and your blood pressure is good. It's 128 over 82 your respiratory rate is 16, and your oxygen saturation is 99% on room air, which is a good thing I'm going to take a listen to. Your heart here, your heart is regular rate and rhythm, and I don't appreciate any ectopic beats or, and I don't hear anything like rubs, murmurs or gallops, which is good, so I'm going to go take. And listen to your lungs here on your lung exam. I do appreciate some diminished lung sounds throughout with the occasional slight expiratory wheeze, and that's bilaterally. So I hear that on both sides, I'm going to go do a quick neck exam here, neck is suppletrakeia, is midline. I don't appreciate any lymphed anapathy taking a listen. Here I don't appreciate any carotid brute. Now I'm also going to take a look at your hands. Here I note strong bilateral pulses. I don't appreciate any clubbing on. Any of your fingertips, which is which is important, and I also note brisk capillary refill. I'm going to go ahead and review the results of your pulmonary function test that I had you do when you came into the office today. And reviewing those results, I do see that they're consistent with somebody who would be diagnosed with asthma. So let me go ahead and tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan. So now for your first problem of asthma, your symptoms are consistent with moderate to intermediate or I'm sorry moderate, moderate intermittent asthma. And it's going to be really important for us to be consistent with your inhaled inhaled steroid inhaler. So I'm going to need you to take that as prescribed. And that's really going to help cut down on those daily symptoms and needing to use that rescue inhaler that albuterol inhaler as frequently. So the more you take and more consistently you take your inhaled steroid inhaler, the less you will use your albuterol. Now it's not a fast acting. Inhaler like your albuterol. But what is important is is going to be what? Helps you long term now if you do have an acute exacerbation. So if you're having an acute issue with your breathing, I do want you to continue to use your albuterol inhaler one to two puffs. And then I want you to wait and see how you're breathing. Is before you would take an additional one to two puffs, we hope you have less of those acute exacerbations. As you continue to use your inhaled steroid, I'm also going to put together an asthma action plan for you. And that's going to help us look at your symptoms. Symptoms see where your pain points can be, you know, like those being having issues with with cats or dust that type of thing. And we'll work on how to handle those symptoms through that asthma action plan. So do you have any questions, comments or concerns? Otherwise, I will see you in 30 days.
[patient]  All right, thank you.
[doctor]  You're welcome.
[doctor]  So let me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan for your first problem of asthma, your symptoms are consistent with moderate intermittent nasma. I'm going to start you on Flove Ant 110 micrograms, one puff twice per day. That's going to be important for you to be consistent with your inhaled steroid inhaler. This is going to help prevent those daily symptoms and from needing for you to use your albuterol. Inhaler or that rescue inhaler less frequently, you can continue using your Ventiline inhaler and that would be two puffs every four to six hours PRN. I'm also going to put together an asthma action plan for you. So we know what to do based on your symptoms I'd like to see you again in a month or sooner if you have any worsening symptoms. Does that sound okay?
[patient]  It does thank you.
[doctor]  You're welcome, I'll see you in a month.
[patient]  Alright, thanks.","CHIEF COMPLAINT

aci,ACI045,"[doctor]  Alright.
[patient]  Good morning, Julie. How are you doing today?
[doctor]  I'm doing okay. I'm just a little nervous about what's been going on with my headaches.
[patient]  Okay, so I know you were sent here by your PCP. What was your understanding of why you were sent here?
[doctor]  Yes, so I actually have been someone who's been struggling with headaches for years now ever since I was a teenager and they used to be around my when I would have my menstrual, my mencise, but as I got older I noticed that it has been with that and also I can get it when I'm really stressed but recently and why I went to her is because my headaches have been getting a lot more, they've just been happening a lot more frequently and a lot more severe.
[patient]  Okay, can you tell me a little bit about them? What, how do they feel when they come on?
[doctor]  So they say mostly on my right side. And it even seems like it's like behind my eye and it just like this pulsing like this really bad pulsing sensation.
[patient]  Okay, do you notice these any activities or time of the day that makes them worse? I know you said that they seem to get worse around your menstrual periods, but is there any time of the day or that makes them worse?
[doctor]  I have noticed that you know I've been trying to exercise more in order to lose weight, but I can't even really exercise for very long because I start of as soon as I start to jog, I my headaches, the headaches come back on a lot worse. So I notice it when I'm exercising.
[patient]  Okay, and do you seem to have any other symptoms when you get these headaches? I've been having a ringing in my ears for a few months now. And then what really scared me is that now I'm starting to get some blurred vision. It's not all the time, but it will come and go, but some blurred like on the...
[doctor]  in my own side of my vision.
[patient]  Okay, okay, and have you experienced any numbness or tingling to your hands or feet or your face?
[doctor]  No, I haven't.
[patient]  Okay, so you like to run a lot. What kind of do you do you use a eight-good shoe? You know, what kind of shoes do you use for your running?
[doctor]  Yeah, I am starting to get back into it. I'm a big new balanced person in A6. So yeah, those are the two brands I like to wear. Yeah. So right now I'm using A6.
[patient]  Okay, yeah, I like to run too and I use Nike.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  I used to get tumor guy, but I really kind of moved over Nike.
[doctor]  Hmm.
[patient]  That's good you know what is running is a great exercise.
[doctor]  It is.
[patient]  So have you had any, let's get back to the exam here. Have you had a recent MRI of your brain? I saw one from a few years ago. But as Dr. White said, anything about getting a more recent MRI.
[doctor]  Yes, she was going to put one in, but she wanted me to see you first and urgently, so they haven't called me yet for the MRI.
[patient]  Okay, so that's good, I think we will follow up with Adam or I. But let's go ahead and take a do a quick physical exam here. I reviewed your vitals that the assistant collected when you came in and everything that looks good, including your blood pressure, you know, with symptoms like that. That's one of those things that I'd be concerned about.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  Now on your heart exam, it sounds like it's normal sinus rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. So that's good as I listen on a go ahead and look here in your eyes, the fundoscopic exam shows papalodema. And that's just some of swelling behind there in the eye. And this let me do neurological exam. This will take a few minutes you get up to follow my instructions as we go through that. Okay. On neurological exam. Craneal nerves, one through 12 are intact, including a normal cranial reflex. And just want to watch you walk across the room here.
[doctor]  Okay, turn around, come back, and okay, so on musculoskeletal exam your gate is normal.
[doctor]  Okay, go ahead, sorry.
[patient]  That's okay for your first problem. Your headaches, your symptoms are concerning for what we call idiopathic intracranial hypertension. And this is a condition that you have increased pressure in the end of your head and your brain without any known cause for it. Now, patient also presents with often present with symptoms such as yours, you know, headaches worsening with activity, ringing in the ears changes in your vision. So I'm pretty confident that that's what we're having here now why we get. Concerned is if the pressure continues to increase this can lead to some permanent changes in your vision. So I do want to get a few more tests just so we can confirm that diagnosis. And the first one that we just talked about is an MRI. I think it's really important to get that a check for any other condition that could be contributing to your symptoms now. Once I have that result, I'm going to be doing also doing a spinal tap, which will help me evaluate the pressure in the brain and it can also help you feel better if you do have an increased pressure by taking the decreasing the amount of that pressure. Just by taking a little bit of fluid off of that. And lastly, I want you to be seen by a neuro-oft homologist for a complete, I exam now. I know that sounded a lot of information, but I think it's really important we get that accomplished. Do you have any questions for me?
[doctor]  Yeah, that is a lot. And so I am sure I'll have more that comes up, but so let's say we do all this test. And it confirms what you're saying does that mean was I referred to you? Because that means I will need surgery.
[patient]  Not necessarily if you have idiopathic intracranial hypertension, there are a number of medications that we can try to help decrease that pressure in your brain. And this will also help you have less headaches when you exercise as exercise and weight loss are also an important part of the treatment.
[doctor]  Okay, all right, all right, and I'll probably add something about so is this something I'll be doing soon? Is this all things I'll be doing this week?
[patient]  Yeah, that's a great question here. I'm going to go ahead and we're going to, for the MRI, I'll have to get a pre-approval from your insurance company. I will work on that my, my, my team in the front office will get that pre-approved. And then once that's done, we'll call you to help schedule that MRI.
[doctor]  Okay, alright, thank you bye.
[patient]  Sorry","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Julie Jenkins is a pleasant 33-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of headaches. The patient was referred from her primary care physician. The patient states that she was seen by Dr. White a few years ago and was going to obtain an MRI; however, Dr. White wanted her to see me first and urgently.

The onset of her headaches began when she was a teenager. Initially, her headaches appeared during menses, however she now experiences them more frequently and with more severity. Her pain is aggravated by physical activities. The patient states that she has been trying to exercise more in order to lose weight, however she is unable to exercise for prolonged periods of time secondary to the headaches. The patient locates her pain to the right side of her head and behind her eye. She describes her pain as a pulsing sensation. She also reports intermittent ringing in her ears for the last few months. Additionally, she reports intermittent blurred vision on the lateral aspect of her vision. She denies any numbness or tingling in her hands, feet, or face.

The patient enjoys running and wears either New Balance or Asics shoes.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Neurological: Reports headaches. Denies numbness or tingling in her hands, feet, or face.

VITALS

Vitals are within normal limits.

PHYSICAL EXAM

CV: Normal head rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
NEURO: Cranial nerves I through XII are intact distally, including a normal cranial reflex.
MSK: Gait is normal.
Funduscopic exam: Positive for papilledema.

ASSESSMENT

Headaches, concern for idiopathic intracranial hypertension.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regard to her current symptoms. I have recommended that we obtain an urgent MRI of the brain to evaluate for any other condition that could be contributing to her symptoms. We will contact her to schedule this after approved by insurance. Once the MRI results are available for review and further discussion, I will also perform a spinal tap to evaluate the pressure in the brain. I have also advised her to be seen by a neuro ophthalmologist for a complete eye exam. Questions were invited and answered today. The patient agrees to the treatment plan.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me once the MRI results are available for review and further recommendations."

So hey there Mark, nice to see you again. Listen, sorry you're having some elbow pain, let's talk about it. But I would like to record this conversation with this cool app that I'm using that's going to help me focus on you a bit more wood that be all right with you.
[patient]  Yeah, that sounds great.
[doctor]  Okay great, so mark tell me about your right elbow pain, what's been happening.
[patient]  So I've been playing a lot of tennis recently, buddy of mine. You know you're always telling me to get off the couch. And be more active. So a buddy of mine asked me if I wanted to go play tennis, he just joined a country club. I've been hitting the court a lot more. And it's just been killing me for the last three weeks or so.
[doctor]  Okay, alright. And where in your elbow is it hurting?
[patient]  outside port.
[doctor]  Okay, does the pain radiate anywhere like down to your arm up to your shoulder or anywhere else?
[patient]  No, it doesn't.
[doctor]  Okay, and what would you say the pain is you know on a scale of 0 to 10?
[patient]  It's probably an 8 when I'm just when I'm using it even if it's to get something out of the cupboard and it's a 3 when I'm just kind of resting.
[doctor]  Okay, and do you say it's a sharp pain stabbing pain aching throbbing? How would you describe it?
[patient]  all of the above shooting stabbing very sharp.
[doctor]  Okay, alright, and you let's see other than the the tennis, you know, increase in tennis activity you haven't had any trauma recently falling on it or you know, fell to pop anywhere, or anything like that have you.
[patient]  Not that I can recall.
[doctor]  Okay, and you said it's its worst with movement better with rest. Is there anything else that makes it makes it worse or makes it better?
[patient]  I've taken some Tylenol and ibuprofen, but as soon as those were off it comes right back, so they don't really help.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  And I did try a little ice, I probably should ice it more, but I didn't notice it helping much.
[doctor]  Okay, okay, all right, yeah, well, I definitely am glad you're getting some exercise now that's good for your diabetes and all that and out there playing tennis kind of back back to the back to the old days for you, right, did you I recall that weren't you a big tennis player back in the day like state champ in high school or something.
[patient]  Yeah, yeah, that was 100 years ago. I can't, I try to play like that. And I can't, I can't do that anymore. But yeah, good memory, that's a good memory.
[doctor]  Now
[patient]  Kind of tennis guy too, right did you see that the Australia opened?
[doctor]  I did I did yeah, that was that was crazy. That was a great tournament what a what a finish unbelievable.
[patient]  Yeah, how did you see the masters I know your golfer?
[doctor]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't get out as often as I as as I like to but but the masters yeah that was that was amazing That was a lot of fun to a lot of fun. Did you catch it too?
[patient]  I did.
[doctor]  Yeah
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  Yeah
[patient]  But that's what I couldn't believe Tiger went out there, of course he did.
[doctor]  Right.
[patient]  It was cool to see nothing.
[doctor]  Yep, yep, agreed, agreed. And so while listening, we'll hopefully get you feeling better here and get you back out on the court and out on the course. And we'll talk about that. But let's let me ask you about your diabetes a little bit a little bit here. So how have your blood sugars been running? Mark, have they been what in the low 100s, 200s? Where are they?
[patient]  They're like 151.60, you know we just had Easter and my kids got a whole bunch of candies. So I keep eating that.
[doctor]  Okay, yeah, yeah, understood. So those cowboy eggs they'll get you every time to write.
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  Boy my gosh, yeah those are the best. So those are those are deadly don't tell my cardiologist. So okay, so listen You know I see that we have you on met four men 500 milligrams once a day no actually last visit We increased it so I've got you on met four men 500 milligrams twice a day correct. You're still taking that
[patient]  Yes, twice a day.
[doctor]  Okay, and but your blood sugars are a bit off, you know, maybe those the Cadbury eggs. So how about your asthma? How has that been doing? You know, have you had any asthma attacks? You're still taking flow event twice a day and the albuterol is needed.
[patient]  You're not going to want my asthma is pretty much under control.
[doctor]  Okay, excellent, excellent, alright. And I recall, you know, just kind of review a few things I think you've got an allergy to penicillin, is that correct?
[patient]  That's correct, yes.
[doctor]  Okay, and then you know your surgical history, you had your gallbladder out what about 10 years ago? I think by Dr. Nelson correct.
[patient]  Yes, that's right.
[doctor]  Okay, and then let's go ahead and examine you alright. So mark your exam is pretty much you know for the most part normal with a few exceptions on your heart exam. You still have a grade three out of six is Stolic ejection murmur. And that's unchanged from prior exam we're watching that. And so that just means I hear some some heart sounds as your heart is beating there I'm not too concerned about it, as as that's not changed otherwise normal. Cardiovascular exam and your physical exam otherwise on. Your musculoskeletal exam on your right elbow you do have moderate lateral epicondler tenderness of the right elbow. And how about when I move this when I move your elbow like this does that hurt you.
[patient]  Kills.
[doctor]  Okay, sorry about that, so you've got moderate pain with passive range of motion of the right elbow. There is no palpable joint effusion, and now what if I press against your wrist like, so does that hurt you?
[patient]  It hurts a little bit.
[doctor]  Okay, all right, sorry. So that's you have mild pain with resisted extension of the right wrist, as well, okay? Otherwise, normal, unremarkable exam. And let's talk about your results now. So your right elbow x-ray today shows no acute fracture or other bony abnormality. So that's good. There's no malalignment or sign of joint effusion. And otherwise, it's a normal right elbow x-ray. So that's reassuring, okay? And hey, you know I meant to ask you. No. And do you have any history of fever recently? You know. Along with the elbow pain, you had noticed a fever.
[patient]  know what i think so
[doctor]  Okay, great excellent. Alright, so tell you what let's let's talk about my assessment and your plan here so for your first problem my assessment is is that you have a cute lateral epicondylitis of your right elbow and this is also known as tennis elbow go figure right. So this is due to overuse likely the increase in your tennis activity which normally would be good but maybe we're overdoing it a little bit. So I have a few recommendations I'd like you to rest your right arm as much as you can I want you to stop tennis for the next four to six weeks and please avoid repetitive stress in that right arm as well. I want you to ice that right elbow for 20 minutes at least three times per day and this should reduce the pain and inflammation and then I'm also going to give you a brace for your right forearm and my nurse will give this to you before you leave that should help with the discomfort okay in that right elbow. I will also write you a prescription for ultram and this should help with the pain. I'll write you a prescription ultram 50 milligrams once per day that should help with your elbow pain so then I want to see you and follow up in four weeks and so we'll reevaluate your elbow at that time and if you will consider some additional imaging if needed possibly a physical therapy referral depending on how you're doing MK now for your second problem of diabetes type two my assessment is is that your blood sugar is a little bit out of control MK so we need to make some adjustments I'm going to increase your metformin to 1000 milligrams twice per day and I want you to check your blood sugar twice daily for the next two weeks and then let me know how your blood sugar is running and we can make some additional adjustments if needed but I will increase your metformin to 1000 milligrams twice a day now I'm going to also order a hemoglobin a1c level and and a cbc blood test today and and so we'll check those results the hemoglobin a1c and the cbc and then I'm going to also check a chem 12 blood test as well and now for your third problem of the mild acute intermittent Nazmi umi assessment is that it really remains under good control so let's keep you on that flow vent and the albuterol no changes there and you can use those as tolerated it does look like you need a refill on your albuterol so I'm going to write you a prescription for a refill of the albuterol and you can pick that up your pharmacy as well so how does that all sound any questions for me
[patient]  It sounds pretty good I can't believe it's just tennis elbow feel like a looser coming in here, but it's okay. I get it.
[doctor]  Yeah, yeah, well.
[patient]  I'm not I'm not young anymore.
[doctor]  Yeah, well let's keep you active, but take a break for a bit, and let's ease back into it okay. So it's great to see you, and I'll see you back in for weeks. Let me know if you have other problems in the meantime.

aci,ACI052,"[doctor]  Alright, so how are you doing today Angela?
[patient]  I'm doing pretty well.
[doctor]  All right, so looking here at your appointment notes, it says, you're here, you think you have a kidney stone, you had some in the past. So we're going to take a look at that. And then you also have a past medical history of hypertension and diabetes. We want to take a look at those as well. So first thing what's going on with your kidneys, you as what how long ago have you been feeling pain? And how's all that?
[patient]  Pain's been up and down. I went to the emergency room last week, but now I think I'm doing a little bit better.
[doctor]  Okay, so the case of kidney stones. So have you had you said you've had them in the past and how often would you say?
[patient]  I don't know why this is probably like my seventh or eighth kidney stone.
[doctor]  Seven or eight kidney stones. So do you think you passed it yet or is it still in there?
[patient]  I think this one passed ya.
[doctor]  This one passed how long would you say it took to?
[patient]  Well, I went last week and then I think it passed about three days ago.
[doctor]  Okay, so are you still noticing any blood in your urine?
[patient]  No, no more blood.
[doctor]  All right, are you still having pain?
[patient]  Nope.
[doctor]  Yeah
[patient]  The pain's gone.
[doctor]  Okay, that's really good. Did they do anything for you at the hospital giving you any medications?
[patient]  They gave me some pain medicine.
[doctor]  Okay, do you remember what it was?
[patient]  i think it was percussed
[doctor]  Okay, well that's good. I'm very glad to see that you were able to pass that stone have you seen a urologist before about this.
[patient]  I haven't seen one in a while, but yes I saw someone maybe a year ago.
[doctor]  Okay, so yeah, I know you keep having these recurrent kidney stones, so I definitely think we can get you a referral to urology just to check up on that and also want to do some labs as well.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  So I also see you're here for you have a past medical history of a hypertension. And when you came in today, your blood pressure was a little bit high. It was a 150 over 90. I'm reading here in your chart. You're on 2.5 of Norbask.
[patient]  Hmm.
[doctor]  Now have you been taking that regularly?
[patient]  I have, but at home I blood pressure is always great.
[doctor]  Okay, maybe you have a little white coat syndrome, some of my patients do have it, I have it myself, and I'm a provider. So I definitely understand, yeah, I know what we talked about last time, you're getting a blood pressure cuff, and taking those about two to three times a week. So what have those readings, but I'm usually like 130 to 140 over 60 to 70.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  That's not too bad. I think when you first came and you were around 180. So it seems to be that that norvask is working for you. How about your diet? I know you were having a little issue eating some fast food. And in cakes and cookies, and have you been able to get that under control?
[patient]  It's hard to give up the fast food altogether because it's a lot of on the go, you know.
[doctor]  Okay, so do you think you would be able to get that under control by yourself or would you do you think you would need help with that maybe a dietician be able to help you out?
[patient]  Yeah, I don't know if I can make another appointment. I just add to the extra.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  Let's start to make food so.
[doctor]  Yeah, yeah, definitely understand.
[patient]  MM
[doctor]  Alright, so I mean that's one thing we just got to work one. As your diet, we try to keep you at least just 2300 milligrams or less of sodium per day I know that's hard for a lot of salads. And stuff I know it's hard for a lot of people especially with all like the pre-packaged foods we have around today. So that's definitely something we should work on.
[patient]  MM
[doctor]  So let's also look here you have a history of diabetes, and so you're on that 500 milligrams of metformin daily. Now have you been taking that as well?
[patient]  Yeah, I take my myth form in.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  So what have your blood sugars been running daily?
[patient]  Well, I don't check it very often.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  But I think they've been pretty good.
[doctor]  Okay, so I'm looking here I think last after your last visit you got A1C now is 6. Seven so it's a little bit high, it's gone down a little bit since you were first diagnosed with the Type 2 diabetes a year ago. So I'm glad we're making progress with that as well alright. So I'm just going to do a quick physical exam on you before I do just want to make sure you're having any chest pain today.
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Alright, any any belly pain.
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Alright, so I'm going to listen to your lungs, your lungs are clear bilaterally. I don't hear any crackles listen to your heart. So on your heart exam, I do hear that grade two out of six histolic ejection murmur, and we already knew about that previously, so it hasn't gotten any worse, so that's good. So I'm going to just press here in your abdomen because that you did have those kidney stones. Does that hurt?
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Alright, I'm going to press here on your back.
[patient]  No pain.
[doctor]  Okay, so on your abdomen exam of your abdomen, I'm showing no tenderness to palpation of the abdomen or tenderness of the CVA either on the right side, so that that's good I think that's pretty much cleared up. So let's we'll talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you. And so my assessment you did have to those kidney stones, but I think they're past this time, but I do want to get a couple of labs, so we'll get a urinalysis.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Alright, we'll get a urine culture just to make sure everything is as cleared up, I also want to give you a referral to referral to urology.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  because you do keep having these all the time and so maybe there's something else going wrong and so they can help get that under control.
[patient]  Can I see Dr. Harris?
[doctor]  Of course, yeah, we can get you that road to Dr. Harris and...
[patient]  He's not like.
[doctor]  He's great. He's he's he's great. I've heard he does really good work. So that'll be good. So for the hypertension, you seem to be doing well on the two. Five of Norvask. So we are not going to make any changes to that. Do you need any refills right now?
[patient]  No usually the pharmacy just sends them through when I call.
[doctor]  Okay great, so we will give you refills with that I do want to give you a consult to nutrition.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  just to help you with that diet.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Because I think that's a major factor of us eventually getting you off of all medications.
[patient]  Hmm.
[doctor]  And then for your diabetes, I'm just keep you on that on that 500-metre form and okay. I think you're doing well with that as well also, but I do want you to start taking your blood sugars if you can take them before every meal.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Just a gauge where you are so you can tell how much food you should actually be be eating.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Alright.
[patient]  I could try that.
[doctor]  So, how does that sound?
[patient]  It sounds like a plan, which should I come back and see you.
[doctor]  So you can come back in three months and we'll check up again. I forgot you did tell me last time that you were having some issues with insomnia.
[patient]  Hmm.
[doctor]  How is that going for you? Is it still happening?
[patient]  I mean sometimes I stay awake just kind of worrying about things but I've tried some meditation apps and that helps.
[doctor]  Okay, alright, and I know we talked a little bit before about practicing proper sleep hygiene, you know, just making sure that all of your electronics are off, you know, dark room.
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  Cool room, have you been doing that?
[patient]  Why do I like to sleep with the TV on and my phone is right by my bed? Because I never know if someone's gonna call me, you know.
[doctor]  Yeah, I know I'm like Apple, I don't know if you have an iPhone or not, but I know Apple has this to the sleep mode now do that disturbance so you put that on.
[patient]  It's a good idea.
[doctor]  interrupt you.
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  Okay have you tried taking melatonin to sleep?
[patient]  I use it a couple times, but it didn't seem to help that much.
[doctor]  Okay, how about I don't think I've prescribed you anything, yet do think you would need anything.
[patient]  I don't really want to take any sleeping pills.
[doctor]  Okay, that's understandable. Alright, so for the last issue for the insomnia, I'm just gonna have you take 10 milligrams of melatonin as needed.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  And just try I guess the best is possible to practice the proper sleep hygiene so you can get to sleep at night and then feel pretty rested.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Alright.
[patient]  MM
[doctor]  So, do you have anything any other questions for me?
[patient]  No, that's all.
[doctor]  Alright, so we will see you in three months.
[patient]  Okay sounds good.
[doctor]  Alright.

aci,ACI060,"[doctor]  Hey Khaled's nice to see you today, can you tell me a little bit about what brought you in?
[patient]  Yeah, I want to see my PCP for a cough, which they diagnosed as bronchitis, but then they did that chest x-ray to make sure I didn't have pneumonia and they found this lung nodule. I went for a CAT scan that confirmed it and they refer me here to you. I'm really nervous document.
[doctor]  Okay, well first of all, and I'm sorry that you're nervous and what we're going to do is we're going to partner together. And I'm going to be right by your side the whole time to hopefully make you a little less nervous and recognize the fact that we're going to have a big support team around you.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  So let's talk a little bit about how long you've had that cough before you want to see your doctor.
[patient]  You know, often I've had it for about three months. I first noticed it when I was loading some pay. I have horses and I bought you know for a hundred bills a day and when I spend a day loading it and then it's I just started coughing a lot more I think around that time and after that I just got a cold so that's what's simming my PCP now. I do exercise, I do a lot of biking and I typically don't get sick and my cough has gone away.
[doctor]  Okay, that's good to hear you mentioned exercise and biking I love to bike myself. I've got a track 7100 hybrid. Have you been on the new trails? They open it was the old, the old rail, the old railroad. Right away they've opened that up. It's like 60 miles of trails.
[patient]  I love that road, just I don't like riding on the road, so I prefer to do those rails the trails type.
[doctor]  Yeah
[patient]  And it's just so phenomenal I do that a lot.
[doctor]  Yeah, I love riding over their way. We will get you all fixed up we will have to go for a bike ride.
[patient]  Absolutely, I'd love it.
[doctor]  That'd be great. So I see here on your medical history that you also have a history of rheumatoid arthritis is that under control at this time. And what do you do to take care of your eye?
[patient]  Yeah, it's its fear you know arthritis never really goes away, but I take methotrexate.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  I think it's 7.5 milligrams every week, and as long as I'm keeping active, my joints feel okay. And if I do have any problems, it's mostly with my hands, but I haven't had any recent flares. So I'm okay right now.
[doctor]  Okay, that's good. I also see here that you marked down that you were a previous smoker and and when when did you when did you stop smoking?
[patient]  I stopped smoking probably about seven years ago.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  and I was young and should have stopped the way before that my kids were on me all the time. But you know I got a new start and finally was able to stop and I felt better after stopping.
[doctor]  Okay, that's good. And I'm glad to hear that you were able to to stop and and stay to back o' free that that's great to hear do you have any pain or any shortness of breath or anything like that.
[patient]  No not at all.
[doctor]  Okay, and I would like to talk about your familial history here. For just a second, do you have any family history of lung cancer or any other type of malignancies?
[patient]  No lung cancer my mom did have breast cancer, but she's doing well now.
[doctor]  Okay, alright, and then things like lung infections or pneumonia. Do you have any previous history of that?
[patient]  No, no, not not anything that I'm aware of.
[doctor]  Okay, if it's okay with you, I'm going to do a quick physical exam. Your vital signs look good today. Blood pressure of 124 over 76 heart rate of 70 respiration rate of 16, oh, two sat on room air of 98 percent. And you are 8th, so you don't have a fever today. I'm going to take a quick listen to your lungs. Here your lungs are clear and equal bilateral when I listen to them or when I osculate your lungs. Now listening to your heart regular rate and rhythm no clicks, rubs or murmurs, and I don't appreciate any extra beats doing a quick extremity exam your skin as pink warm and dry. I don't appreciate any edema to your lower extremities. It looks like you do have a little bit of swelling to tear knuckles there on your third digit on each hand, which can be normal for somebody who is RA. However, pulses are intact in all extremities and capillary refill is brisk. So a quick review of your results. Now you had a chest CT before you came into see me and the results of that chest CT do show a solitary two centimeter nodule in the lateral aspect of the right upper lobe now. It appears the nodule is smooth in appearance and no evidence of any type of emphysemitis disease is present, which is good now for my assessment and plan for you. So you do have an incidentally found right upper lobe lung nodule. I'm going to order some PFT, which is pulmonary function test. I just want to a check and a baseline for your lung function. I'm also going to schedule a pet CT. This is going to help to determine if that nodule is metabolically active meaning if it lights up it, it can suggest that it's cancer or inflammatory. I'm going to go ahead and suggest that we do remove this during or by a video assisted thoracoscopy, which means it's just going to be three small incisions made on the side of your right chest. I'm going to go in with a camera and a scope and we'll remove that along with a very small portion of your lung. You're going to be under general anesthesia and it'll take about an hour and a half or so post procedure you're going to be admitted and you'll have a chest tube and until the following day and I'm going to go ahead and take that out then at bedside. Most likely you're going to be in the hospital for one night and go home the next day. It could be a benign nodule, but because you're smoking history, I really do think it's going to be best that you have that removed now for your secondary concern of your rheumatoid arthritis. I want you to continue to follow up with your rheumatologist and continue your medication therapy as has been previously outlined for you. Now do you have any questions, comments or concerns before before we get the paperwork signed to start the treatment process?
[patient]  No, I don't think so. I think I'll be okay. I'm scared.
[doctor]  I know you're scared, but we'll be right here with you the whole way.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Alright, we'll get some paperwork and I'll see you again in a few minutes.
[patient]  Okay, thank you.","CHIEF COMPLAINT

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Respiratory: Denies cough or shortness of breath.

VITALS

Blood Pressure: 124/76 mmHg.
Heart Rate: 70 beats per minute.
Respiratory Rate: 16 breaths per minute.
Oxygen Saturation: 98% on room air.
Body Temperature: Afebrile.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Respiratory
- Auscultation of Lungs: Clear and equal bilaterally.

Cardiovascular
- Auscultation of Heart: Regular rate and rhythm. No clicks, rubs, or murmurs. Pulses are intact in all extremities.

Musculoskeletal
- Examination: No lower extremity edema. Mild swelling to the 3rd digit knuckles on the bilateral hands, consistent with RA.

Integumentary
- Examination: Skin is pink, warm, and dry. Capillary refill is brisk.

RESULTS

CT scan of chest, obtained at an outside facility, is reviewed today and demonstrates a solitary 2 cm nodule in the lateral aspect of the right upper lobe. It appears the nodule is smooth in appearance. No evidence of any type of emphysematous disease is present.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Right upper lobe lung nodule.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient has incidentally found right upper lobe lung nodule visible on his chest CT. It could be a benign nodule, but because of his smoking history, I think it is best that he has it surgically removed.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I had a thorough discussion with the patient concerning surgical treatment. Surgery will require general anesthesia and will take approximately 1.5 hours. I explained to the patient that his procedure will consist of 3 small incisions being made on the side of his right chest. I will then insert a camera and scope to assist in removing the nodule along with a very small portion of his lung. He was advised that he will be admitted for most likely an overnight stay. He will have a chest tube in until the following day when I remove it at his bedside. All questions were answered.
- Medical Treatment: Pulmonary function test ordered today to obtain patient's baseline. PET CT will also be scheduled to determine if the nodule is metabolically active, which can suggest if it is cancerous or inflammatory. Nodule will be removed via video assisted thoracoscopy.

2. Rheumatoid arthritis.
- Medical Reasoning: Stable.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged the patient to continue to follow up with his rheumatologist.
- Medical Treatment: Continue medication therapy and routine follow up with rheumatologist as previously outlined.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

aci,ACI062,"[doctor]  Okay, highway and will I understand your here for you've got a sore on your foot that's not healing is that right?
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  So can you tell me about that how are you doing?
[patient]  Well, I've been doing okay, but I've had this wound on my right foot for a couple of weeks, and it's not getting better, I saw my PCP, and they referred me to UI, I used to see a podiatrist a couple of years ago, but they moved and I wasn't able to get another one.
[doctor]  Okay, and how long have you had the wound?
[patient]  about 2-3 weeks.
[doctor]  Okay, have you had any kind of trauma to that foot?
[patient]  No, I bought a new pair of shoes to travel with and then a rapathy. I guess I didn't feel that they were too tight at first. It was just a blister, but it looked a lot worse now. I've been putting a bandaid on it. And...
[doctor]  Okay, and so did your doctor put you on any antibiotics when they saw your foot.
[patient]  Yes, I finished the course yesterday, the wound looked about the same though.
[doctor]  Okay, now does it hurt?
[patient]  No, I can't feel it.
[doctor]  Okay, now have you had any other symptoms like fever chills drainage from the wound or anything along those lines?
[patient]  Now, but when I take my sock off, sometimes it sticks to the wound, even when I put a bandaid on.
[doctor]  Okay, while you're still wearing those same shoes that cause the problem.
[patient]  No I'm upset.
[doctor]  I'm so upset, too I love those shoes.
[patient]  Now I'm so upset, I love those shoes.
[doctor]  Okay, so what kind of shoes are they?
[patient]  they're Hokies!
[doctor]  Also, where did you get them?
[patient]  I got them at Ray a couple of years ago.
[doctor]  They're pretty good about helping you to fit your fit you in a shoe, aren't they?
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  So, what do you like about them?
[patient]  They are comfortable, they are easy to take on and off, and they provide good stability.
[doctor]  That's good, so you've had some issues with stability sometimes, or...
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  Okay, okay. Well, another question I want to ask you is how is your diabetes doing?
[patient]  I don't think it's too bad my last Himo Globe in a 1C was a little over 8.
[doctor]  Okay, all right. Well, let me just do a quick physical exam. Okay. For vital signs, your temperature is 98. When your vital signs look good, your heart rate is 72 respirations, 16 blood pressure is 110 over 65. Okay. So on your foot exam, let's see there is a 1 by 2-inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot. It is just proximal to the right fifth to the fifth empty P joint. And there is some yellow slew present with minimal granulation tissue. There's no surrounding erythema or cellulitis. And there's no evidence of fluid collection. There's no necrosis there. Is no odor? I do not appreciate any bony exposure on on vascular exam. There are palpable bilateral femoral and pupletial pulses. There are no palpable DP or point pulses. But Doppler signs are present okay. So does this hurt when I touch it here?
[patient]  No, it's okay.
[doctor]  Okay, all right. So I've reviewed the results, your right foot x-ray that we did before you. I came in the room and this shows no evidence of osteomyelitis, which means there is no evidence of bone infection. So that's really good. So let me tell you a little about my assessment and plan for you. So for your first problem, your diabetic foot ulcer. So I want to order an ankle-break ill index ABI to determine the blood supply to your foot too. See if you can heal this wound. I'm also going to perform a debridement here in the office to take off some of the dead tissue. And then next I'm going to prescribe a collagenase ointment to be applied to the wound once daily and then cover with a dry sterile dressing. Now we will continue this until we see the wound shrinking and a nice pink tissue is present. And I want you to wear a surgical shoe to take pressure off of the area. Okay, so I don't think any more antibiotics are needed at this time. And I want to see you again in two weeks. So we may need to refer you to a vascular specialist. If the ABI indicates your blood supply is not optimal for wound healing okay.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Okay, so for your diabetes, it's going to be very important to get your diabetes under control in order to get the wound to heal. So we might even go ahead and get a diabetic consult so that we can go over some some maybe some ways you can modify your diet without it being too much, but maybe that can bring down your hemoglobin A1C into a little bit better level, okay?
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Alright, do you have any other questions?
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Okay.","HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Wayne Jenkins is a pleasant 43-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of a right foot wound, onset 2 to 3 weeks ago. He was seen by his primary care physician who referred him to our office. His last visit with a podiatrist was 2 years ago, however they moved, and he has been unable to get another podiatrist. He denies any specific injury.

The patient purchased a new pair of shoes and was breaking them in prior to traveling. Initially, he did not feel that the shoes were too tight, however a blister formed on his right foot. The patient does have neuropathy and notes this might be why he did not notice the tightness. His blister soon became a wound and he was seen by his PCP. He was placed on a round of antibiotics, which he completed yesterday. He denies any changes to the appearance of the wound. The patient denies pain or drainage. His sock will occasionally stick to his wound, regardless of if he has a Band-Aid covering it. The patient has discontinued the use of these shoes. Occasionally, he has issues with stability, which was a primary purpose of purchasing these shoes. He denies any fever or chills.

Regarding his diabetes, his last hemoglobin A1C was 8.

Blood pressure: 110/65 mm Hg.

PHYSICAL EXAM

CV: Palpable bilateral femoral and popliteal pulses. No palpable DP or PT pulses but Doppler signs are present. No evidence of fluid collection.
SKIN: On the right foot, there is a 1 x 2 inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot that is just proximal to the 5th MTP joint. There is some yellow slough present with minimal granulation tissue. No surrounding erythema or cellulitis. No necrosis. No odor.

RESULTS

3 views of the right foot were taken today. These reveal no evidence of osteomyelitis.

ASSESSMENT

1. Right foot diabetic ulcer.
2. Diabetes.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient regarding his current symptoms. I have explained to him that his x-rays did not reveal any evidence of osteomyelitis. At this time, I have recommended that we obtain an ankle brachial index ABI to determine the blood supply to his foot to see if he can heal this wound. I have also performed a debridement in the office to remove some of the dead tissue. I have prescribed a collagenase ointment to be applied to the wound 1 time daily and instructed him to cover with a dry sterile dressing. He will continue this until we see the wound shrinking and the nice pink tissue is present. I have also recommended that the patient be placed in a surgical shoe to take pressure off the area. I do not think that antibiotics are needed at this time. He may need to see a vascular specialist if the ABI indicates that his blood supply is not optimal for wound healing.

Regarding his diabetes, I explained the need for controlling his diabetes and the effects this will have on wound healing. I have recommended a diabetic consultation to discuss diet modifications to bring his hemoglobin A1c to a better level.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me in 2 weeks to check on his progress."
aci,ACI066,"[doctor]  Hey Charles, I'm using this cool new recording device to help me with my documentation. Is that okay with you?
[patient]  Sure.
[doctor]  Awesome, how are you doing today?

[doctor]  I love it lots of deer around awesome.
[patient]  You be Hunter.
[doctor]  Huge Hunter I love Hunter ya.
[patient]  I have a refrigerator full of venison at home.
[doctor]  D.U.
[patient]  MM
[doctor]  You want to carry share shore? Yeah, we can switch.
[patient]  Nice, but so the thing is I have noticed that for some reason my breathing.
[doctor]  isn't what it used to be.
[patient]  Sure.
[doctor]  Yeah, it's you know I seem to catch my breath a lot more than I used to, and I consider myself to be pretty healthy.
[patient]  You look pretty healthy.
[doctor]  Thanks so, do you think you're feeling short of breath?
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  Okay, is there you know? Is there any other symptoms that you have with that I get like, you know, mid-shortness of breath suddenly? For some reason, I'm not quite sure why.
[patient]  Hmm.
[doctor]  Eyes their water doesn't make very much sense to me.
[patient]  MM
[doctor]  I always think it's allergies.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Mostly could be.
[patient]  I have a dog that eyes water like that she always gets eyebuggers.
[doctor]  Yeah, I get eyebuggers too.
[patient]  Ah
[doctor]  Crazy, other last time it happened, I went to the urgent care and they gave me a nebulizer that helped.
[patient]  They prescribed me an inhaler that I use now when I feel the symptoms coming on.
[doctor]  Okay, great. Do you ever notice a rash with any of this?
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Do you have any nausea vomiting?
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Besides, when you go out heavy drinking right.
[patient]  I mean, I die, Rhea. Quite a bit once I go out.
[doctor]  I understand that.
[patient]  Heavy drinking.
[doctor]  Yet you ever get lip or throat swelling.
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Have you ever had any issues with allergies in the past?
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  What situations do you notice the symptoms come on when is it when you're near your cat or outside the house?
[patient]  I have noticed them in all three situations.
[doctor]  Hmm.
[patient]  In the house when the cat isn't around and outside as well.
[doctor]  Hmm, yeah, I'm not a big cat person.
[patient]  No neither.
[doctor]  Do you have any symptoms now, while which is?
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  No no travels and no symptoms right now.
[patient]  MM
[doctor]  Okay.
[doctor]  Okay, all right. So I'm going to do a physical exam for you right now. Your vital signs look good. Your pulse is okay. And yeah, your pulse ox is normal. So that's good. You don't appear in any distress. You maybe might be a little bit nervous to come in. And see me, but looks pretty good. I do not appreciate any rash on your body. There is no angiodema, which is just swelling of your lips like you mentioned no audible strider, which is a bad noise in your airway when it gets swollen. So that's good news if you just want to take a deep breath listening to your lungs on your lungs exam. I do appreciate some faint expiratory weezing bilaterally in all lung fields. So I know you had a chest x-ray. When you came and I'm looking at that chest x-ray right now, and your pulmonary function test. And they were both normal. So let's talk a little bit about what I think is going on for your first problem. You have newly diagnosed allergic asthma. So I want you to continue the albuterol inhaler. I don't want you to wait until your symptoms flare up or are bad take it. As soon as you start to feel any symptoms at all, I'm going to prescribe something else called singular 10 milligrams. You might have seen some commercial sport.
[patient]  Hmm.
[doctor]  You take that once daily and that's going to help decrease the occurrences of your asthma.
[patient]  Hmm.
[doctor]  I also am going to proceed with allergy testing have you ever had an allergy test before?
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Okay, we'll start with skin testing and we'll see if we can target what the triggers and hopes and hopes that we can avoid any any other management. And this can be successful if we can't figure out what it is from that we'll have to discuss more testing in your blood and do immunotherapy. So I want to see you next week to schedule the skin testing. Do you have any questions for me?
[patient]  Should I come, I can't?
[doctor]  Yes.","CHIEF COMPLAINT

[patient]  Well, we had a long spring and the other day we got some snow and ice I was walking to my car and I slipped and my left ankle kind of turned underneath me.
[doctor]  Okay, and so this happened a couple days ago or how many days ago?
[patient]  Two days ago.
[doctor]  Two days ago, okay, and so it's your left ankle and it kind of just twisted underneath you on the kind of on the inside.

[doctor]  And did you fall down or did you just kind of cut-catch yourself?
[patient]  No I fell.
[doctor]  Okay, and were you able to get up afterwards or somebody helped you up?
[patient]  I was but it was very sore and then started swelling in quite a bit of pain, so it's hard to walk.
[doctor]  Sure, have you tried anything for pain or the swelling or anything like that?
[patient]  I be profan some ice and elevation.
[doctor]  Okay, has that helped much or not really?
[patient]  A little bit.
[doctor]  Okay, and any pain above your ankle does it hurt on your on your calf or your lower leg at all or knee at all?
[patient]  Now it's mostly just the outside of my ankle.
[doctor]  Okay got it and no bleeding or I'm sure it's a little swollen probably.
[patient]  It's swollen but no bleeding.
[doctor]  Well, I'll have you take off your shoes in a second. We'll examine you in a second, but since you're here, and I wanted to talk about some of your other things that you know we have and I haven't seen you in a year. So let's talk about your history of diabetes, as well are you taking the metformin house your blood sugars, been how how are you managing that any issues with that?
[patient]  No, they've been pretty stable.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  so with my diet.
[doctor]  Good.
[patient]  So
[doctor]  You're checking your sugars regularly as well.
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  Okay, your hemoglobin A1c last time I looked at Epic was about 6. A, which is really good. So I think you're doing a great job. We had talked about, you know, cutting off the sweets and sugars and stuff like that and exercising. So it sounds like you're doing a pretty good job, but that have you seen the off-the-mologist recently for your eye exam for your diabetes checkup or no?
[patient]  I am due for one of those in the next couple of weeks.
[doctor]  Okay, all right. So, Will, so you do you already have an appointment or do you need to make an appointment for that?
[patient]  I have an appointment.
[doctor]  Perfect excellent, okay. And how is your blood pressure been? I know we watching it your blood pressure today looks pretty good. It's about 170 over, I'm sorry, 120 over 70. You're taking norbask any issues with that. Any do need any refills or anything.
[patient]  I need a refill on that, yes.
[doctor]  Okay, all right. Well, let me examine you here for a second. So I'm going to go ahead and do my match exam and I'm just going to verbalize some of my findings. So I can put that into my record. Okay. So your neck exam is fine. There is no roots. Your lungs are clear. Your heart exam is normal. You do have a two over six histolic ejection murmur. You had that in the past unchanged from before. So that's not really worried about that. Your belly exam is good on your ankle exam on your left ankle. You do have some tenderness over the lateral maliolis and you do also have some tenderness over this bone here, which is the fifth metatarsal. So I don't see any. There is some swelling. There's some redness, but there is some pain with valgus dressing of your ankle as well. And let me turn off my phone here and also you do have otherwise normal sensation normal pulses. So on your so my diagnosis for your ankle is I think you probably have an ankle sprained, but I would like to order an x-ray of your ankle because you do have some tenderness over this bone. And I'm sometimes worried about a fracture. So I'm going to go ahead and get an x-ray. I'm going to put you in a split. We're going to put you in an air splint. And I'll give you some crutches until I get the x-ray back. I want you to do just avoid weight bearing. Just to make sure there is no fracture there. I will give you some nappers and 500 milligrams twice a day for pain control. Keep it elevated. Put some ice on it. I think those are all good things. And if the x-ray shows a fracture, I'm going to go ahead and give you a call back and we'll send you to orthopedics. But right now let's try this air splint. If there is no fracture, I will probably have you take off the air splint and do some partial weight bearing. And see how it goes. Does that sound like a reasonable plan for you?
[patient]  At a great plan, I need to get back to exercising so.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  Thank you.
[doctor]  Perfect, and for the diabetes, keep the eye appointment that you already have, you know, continue with the metformin. I'm going to order another hemoglobin. A1c today will check some baseline labs as well since it's been a while since we checked them. And then once if you have any issues or you know, give me a call, we can get you into the office. And for the high blood pressure, I'll go ahead and refill the norvask today. You're doing a great job with that. It sounds like continue to monitor that if something changes, certainly call me.

aci,ACI077,"[doctor]  Hi Jacqueline, how are you doing today?
[patient]  I'm doing okay. I'm just really anxious about my recent blood work that my PCP did and said that I have hepatitis C. I'm just really surprised because I've been feeling fine.
[doctor]  Okay, so were you ever told in the past that you have hepatitis C?
[patient]  No never.
[doctor]  Okay, and do you have any history like for drug use known that you know or do you have any known to have any like hepatitis C positive partners?
[patient]  I mean like years ago I used to party a lot and even used four drugs but I've been clean for over 15 years now.
[doctor]  Okay, well very good you know congratulations on that. That's that's a great great achievement. So tell me though how about alcohol use?
[patient]  I used to drink a lot, a lot more alcohol. Now, I probably would say I drink about a beer a day.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  and maybe slightly more on the weekends, but nothing like how I used to.
[doctor]  Okay, alright, how about smoking have you ever smoked?
[patient]  I do smoke I'm down to one at two cigarettes a day. It's just really been tough to just get rid of those too. But I've cut down a lot I used to I was up to one point or a pack and half a day.
[doctor]  Wow, okay, alright, so yeah, you definitely have decreased that, so that's again good for you on that one, so hopefully you keep you keep that up.
[patient]  Thing.
[doctor]  So, tell me do you have any other medication conditions?
[patient]  Do I know otherwise, I'm feeling pretty good? I had my physical. There was nothing else to the only thing I was telling my PCP. As I do feel like, it's going to be really tired at the end of the day after working. But otherwise, I've been good.
[doctor]  Okay, and has work been not hard lately you've been busy it sounds like.
[patient]  I know I've been busy, but not really much more than usual.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  So that's why I was kind of marking because I mean I used to be able to be fine, but I just lately have been feeling like I'm getting enough sleep, but I still get very tired at the end of the day.
[doctor]  Okay, all right, well I hope you're not working too much and then you'll able to at least find some time with the family.
[patient]  Yeah, am I, yeah, I tend to be a workaholic, but yes, I am working on that.
[doctor]  Okay, well I hope kids are doing okay.
[patient]  There, thank you.
[doctor]  Okay, good. So tell me what conditions, what kind of conditions run in your family? Like, is there, do you have hypertension diabetes or?
[patient]  Y'all have all of the above.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  hypertension diabetes and also depression.
[doctor]  Okay, and depression, okay? All right, well let's go ahead and do a quick physical exam on you here. I reviewed your vitals and everything there looks good. So that's good. And now on general appearance, you appear in no distress and no jaundice on skin exam. Let me go ahead and listen to your heart here, great on your heart exam. You have a nice regular rate and rhythm with a two out of six, six, systolic murmur appreciate appreciated. That's that hasn't changed from last year. So we will just continue to monitor that monitor that as well. Okay.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  All right, now let me listen to your lungs here very good, so your lungs are clear with no weasers, rals or a ronkey, and let me go ahead and listen to your abdomen, great your bowel sounds, or present your abdomen as soft with no hepatosplino splenomegaly, can't talk to appreciate it. So let me now check your musculoskeletal exam. Here great, I didn't see any gate disturbance and no edema, so that's great, so jackal and I did. Review the results of your recent blood blood work and your HCV antibody. Test was positive and your liver panel that was done showing an elevated AST at 39, but your all-tell, buman and total bilirubin were all within normal limits. So what that all means, and let me go ahead and tell you about my assessment, and plan here for your first problem of hepatitis C, your initial labs are consistent with hepatitis C, so based on the the once I just discussed with you there now, hepatitis C, is a viral infection that affects the liver, so you most likely may have had it for. Years now, so the next step that I would like to do is to confirm the diagnosis with some additional blood work that includes checking the hepat C RNA and also the HCV genotype okay. Now I would also like to determine the severity of your liver disease by checking for fibrosis of a liver and I'm going to do this by ordering a special ultrasound and with this information I'm going to be able to know how to proceed as far as treatment.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  All right, now I know that was a lot of information. Do you have any questions for me?
[patient]  Yeah, so should I be worried about my wife and my kids? Should they be tested as well?
[doctor]  Yes, so we can start with the same screening that you have had for you for all of them first okay.
[patient]  Okay, all right, so we'll make sure I'll have them set up an appointment with our family doctor.
[doctor]  Okay, great. So if you don't have any other questions, I'm going to have the nurse check you out and get all that scheduled and I'm going to see you in about three weeks.
[patient]  Alright, perfect.
[doctor]  Alright.
[patient]  Thank you.

aci,ACI084,"[doctor]  So Tyler is a 56-year-old male who presents today complaining of difficulty swallowing and has a past medical history of diabetes and high blood pressure. So Tyler tell me what's going on with your swallowing problem.
[patient]  Well, it's just been something that I have noticed over the last, you know, for the five weeks, it seems like something is always stuck in my throat. And, you know, just I kind of go about my day and it kind of bothers me. You know, a little bit sometimes a little painful. And when I try to eat, it just seems like I have to, I don't know when it's something solid. I kind of have to wash it down on occasion. I've never really fully choked, but I have to admit that I've thought about potentially choking.
[doctor]  Okay, and is it seem to be stuck in your throat or does it seem to go in your lungs area or are you coughing with this at all or just mostly when you're swallowing?
[patient]  No coughing, just kind of when I swallow, it's all okay with liquids. But when I kind of swallow, you know, like a bite of sandwich, sometimes it just feels like, like, I just need a little help pushing it down.
[doctor]  Okay, and is it more kind of like heart like steaks or heart like larger solid like things that are that you have to chew more or is it even soft stuff like you know to eat yogurt and stuff like that?
[patient]  I'm not 100% sure, but I think it's probably more with solids.
[doctor]  Okay, how about have you noticed anything different with when you're swallowing cold or or or hot liquids? Is there is there a temperature change any modification to that?
[patient]  It's really just about solids.
[doctor]  Okay, all right, so have you noticed any blood in any place or blood in your stools or are you vomiting anything up at all?
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Okay, that's so no vomiting blood, no coughing up blood, or anything like that any weight loss or changes in your weight at all.
[patient]  Not that I want.
[doctor]  Okay, yeah, I mean, I think we all like to lose a little bit of weight, but yeah, it says it's a struggle. So no, no chest pain or shortness of breath with this.
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Okay, so I am going to talk about that in a second. I'll look at your throat as well and see what we need to do. But it sounds like we may have to send you to a specialist to take a look at that and see if there is something causing this. How about how are you doing with your diabetes? By the way, since I haven't seen you in a while, I know we have you on met form in 500 milligrams twice a day. We checked your hemoglobin A1c last time. Was seven. For we talked about improving your diet and exercise how are things going.
[patient]  I think they're going great. I mean, I'm taking my meds, I'm sticking to them, and I feel pretty good otherwise.
[doctor]  Okay, are you checking your blood sugars in the morning or are you checking those at all?
[patient]  Yeah, I don't mean once in a while I'm in a hurry and I skip it, but I have to say I probably do so about 80% of the time.
[doctor]  and how are the numbers looking?
[patient]  They're looking you know okay, they are all within you know the range that we are targeting.
[doctor]  Okay, all right. And any any no nausea vomiting or diarrhea or any other side effects from the metformin or anything like that.
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Okay, good. So I think we should probably repeat your hemoglobin A1C. It sounds like you've you know you've improved your diet and it sounds like you've you're following the regimen. So maybe the numbers will be better this time and we don't have to change your medication. So that will be awesome. How are you doing with your blood pressure? I know we have you on norvask. We ask that you check it like you know once a week or more than that if you have time blood pressure looks good today in the office. It's about 150. I'm sorry 120 over 50 right now so no nothing here in the office. Hard things at home.
[patient]  I get to now every once in a while you know the lower numbers a little bit you know higher, but it's not you know usually it's either close or on-range.
[doctor]  Okay, all right, good. So let me examine you now. So Tyler, I'm examining you now. I'm going to just verbalize some of my findings. Your neck is fine. I don't see any swelling in your neck. Your thyroid feels normal. I don't feel any masses in your neck. There's no lymph nodes. I'm looking at your throat. And that looks okay. There is no masses or any swelling that I can see. There is no redness. Yeah, there is no carotid brute. Your lung exam is clear. Your heart exam is normal. No murmurs on your belly exam. You have some epicastric tenderness right here in the right here where I'm pressing, but I don't feel any masses or any significant swelling back. There are no normal back exam. Your extremity exam looks normal. Your neurological exam is fine. So for this difficulty swallowing, I'm concerned that you may have a narrowing in your throat that's causing this. And sometimes it can be from a structure where some narrowing of the esophagus. And sometimes I need to go in and dilate that so I'm going to go ahead and send you. Give you a referral for gastroenterology and have them do a scope and take a look down there. I'm going to recommend we put you on some prilosec. Sometimes also reflux medicine. Can if you have reflux, sometimes that can also exacerbate this sometimes. So I'm going to put you on some prilosec 20 milligrams. Once a day again, I'm going to recommend that you chew your foods frequently and make sure you have it, you know, especially if you're eating something hard like steak or meat chew them really well. So they don't get tend to get stuck. Some people have sometimes things get stuck and they don't go down. And if that happens as an emergency, you do have to go to the emergency department. But seems like you know things are going down. They just seem to sometimes slow down or get stuck temporarily. So why don't I get you a referral for GI? We will start you on the prilosec. And then we will have you know if you know if you have any other symptoms or worsening's give my office a call. We will get you in or get you referred to the ER if needed any questions about that.
[patient]  No, that sounds great.
[doctor]  Okay, and for the diabetes, I'm going to order another hemoglobin. A1C, I'm going to order some more blood work today. We'll check a kidney function. And I notice that you have not had an eye referral. So I'm going to also give you an eye referral to ophthalmology to check your eyes for your diabetic, for your for any retinopathy, continue them at foreman. I'll have you come back in about a month. And that way we'll have the results back for the blood. Test if we need to make any adjustments we can, but I want to see. You back in about a month, and I think that's it for that. Any questions about that?
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Okay, and the high blood pressure, I think you're doing great continue with the Norvask. If you have any issues, certainly call me, but otherwise there is really nothing else to add for that. Did we forget anything or do need refills for anything?
[patient]  You know, I think I'm low on the Norvask, so if you could send something to my pharmacy, that would be great.
[doctor]  Okay, sure I'll get you a refill for Norvask. We'll get that sent over to the pharmacy, okay?
[patient]  Thank you.
[doctor]  Alright, thanks. Good seeing you. Thanks for coming into them.","SUBJECTIVE

aci,ACI086,"[doctor]  So, Brian, it's nice to see you again in the office today. What's going on?
[patient]  I was in my yard yesterday and I was raking leaves and I felt fine. And then when I got into my house about two hours later my back started tightening up and I started getting pins and needles in my right foot.
[doctor]  All right, have you ever had this type of back pain before?
[patient]  I had it once about three years ago, but it went away after a day.
[doctor]  Okay, and did you try anything for the pain yet did you take anything or have you have you tried icing?
[patient]  Put some ice on it and I tried two adveels and it didn't help.
[doctor]  Okay, does it get better when you're laying down sitting standing?
[patient]  Yeah, I think the only thing that helped was a hot shower and it feels a little better when I sit.
[doctor]  Okay, all right, so you said you were raking leaves and now it's been kind of that weather outside for cleaning out the yard. Have you been doing a lot of yard work lately?
[patient]  I normally don't do any physical activity.
[doctor]  Yeah, I hear you, I make a, I make my husband do all the yard work too. So all right, let me take a look at that low back. If you bend over, does that hurt?
[patient]  It hurts a little bit when I bend over yes.
[doctor]  Okay, how about when you stand back up?
[patient]  No pain.
[doctor]  Okay, so no pain on extension, some pain on flexion. How about when I push right here on your back?
[patient]  Yeah, that hurts.
[doctor]  Okay, so some pain to palpation right around the L5. Can I have that?
[patient]  What happens when family members shine in like I'm doing right now? Because I actually think it was it hurts more when he stands up, because I've watched him bend over, but it's when he stands up that it really hurts.
[doctor]  Okay, and what's your relationship?
[patient]  Partners
[doctor]  Okay, so your partner is here with you today and reports that he is also having pain when you are standing up.
[patient]  I've spent so many times you know who I am.
[doctor]  So that's right, you always come in together, have you noticed anything else partner when when he is?
[patient]  I'm worried about it because he as he know his pain tolerance is so high and he wouldn't be saying anything if it really wasn't a problem because it's not at all like last week when he thought about raking leaves, but didn't actually rake leaves, but then his back didn't hurt as much, but this time it really hurts.
[doctor]  Okay, so you think this is more of a long term injury.
[patient]  No, he was just thinking about it hurting when he thought about raking, but it didn't.
[doctor]  Okay, alright, and have you noticed any any prior pain with the back?
[patient]  I don't want to take this away, you better go back to talking to him.
[doctor]  That's all right, let's see how it turns out okay. So how about if you if I push down on both your feet like this, can you push back up on my hands?
[patient]  Can you repeat that?
[doctor]  If I'm pushing down on your feet, can you push push your feet back?
[patient]  Bye.
[doctor]  Alright, so your dorsiflexion is normal looks like pulses are equal in all extremities. You said you had a little bit of a tingling sensation in which leg.
[patient]  That would be my right leg.
[doctor]  Okay, so some tingling in your right leg. All right, so I know that you had an x-ray when you came in because we always do x-rays when we have our patients come in of your low back and everything looks normal from that perspective. So for your back pain, sounds like you probably sprained your low back. So I what I want you to do is let's rest and I'm going to prescribe some molloxochem. Have you taken that before?
[patient]  I have not taken a loxacam.
[doctor]  Alright, so I'll prescribe that I'm also going to prescribe some physical therapy. I know you said you haven't been overly active and your partner reported the same thing for a long time. So we might want to get you into some point and hopefully get you back back in shape, get you some stretches that you can do and some exercises. And then, you know, if it's not improving, I want you to send me a message. And we can possibly look into see if there is anything else going on potentially. And then Mariah, if it's still not. Improving does that sound like an okay plan.
[patient]  It sounds reasonable.
[doctor]  Alright.
[patient]  I think you should have an MRI now. I think he had surgery yesterday. I think you should have an MRI now. This has been hurting for like six hours now. And she had an MRI. We are really worried about it.
[doctor]  Alright, you know, let's give it a couple of weeks and let's give it two weeks and then call me back and we'll get you an MRI if it's still not improving.
[patient]  Good answer.
[doctor]  Alright, alright, hope you feel better.","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Low back pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Approximately 2 hours after he finished raking leaves yesterday, the patient began to feel a tightening sensation in his low back and tingling in his right foot. Prior to this, he recalls a similar episode approximately 3 years ago in which his symptoms resolved after 1 day. Ice and Advil provided no relief, but his pain is less severe when he is in a seated position and taking a hot shower helped alleviate his pain. The patient's partner reports that his pain seems to worsen when he stands up.

Musculoskeletal: Reports low back pain.
Neurological: Reports tingling in the right foot.

PHYSICAL EXAM

NEURO: Normal strength and sensation.
MSK: Examination of the lumbar spine: No pain on extension. Some pain with flexion. Pain with palpation around L5. Dorsiflexion is normal. Pulses are equal in all extremities.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up in 2 weeks."
aci,ACI088,"[doctor]  Hey, Hi Bobby, how are you doing?
[patient]  I'm doing good, how are you?
[doctor]  I'm doing fine so I understand you're here having some left or some right shoulder pain that you've had for a few weeks now.
[patient]  It was I was doing some work in my backyard and a lot of different projects going on and you know I was obviously sore all over the next couple of days but my right shoulder just keeps on bothering me and it keeps it's just really sore and it just hasn't been going away.
[doctor]  Okay, so have you had ever had any pain in that shoulder before?
[patient]  A little bit, I you know, I hurt that same shoulder because it's my dominant hand, my right hand, I hurt a playing baseball when I was younger.
[doctor]  Hmm.
[patient]  So, I've always had a little bit issues, but this is it doesn't feel like it's in the rotator cuff, it's kind of more on the outside, and it's kind of like it's more tender on the outside when I raise my arm up so.
[doctor]  Okay, yeah are you able to move your arm very well or not?
[patient]  Yeah, there's no restriction with my arm. It just, I definitely feel some pain on the outside of it.
[doctor]  Okay, and are you having pain all the time? Or just or does it come and go?
[patient]  Just whenever I move it if I'm sitting still I really don't notice anything. But whenever I move it then I can definitely feel some pain.
[doctor]  Okay, how about at night? Is it bothering you at night also?
[patient]  a little bit because I sleep on that side so.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  Of course.
[doctor]  Okay, and I may mis-did you say what have you been taking for pain for that?
[patient]  I've just been taking some Advil and then icing as much as I can. So that's about it.
[doctor]  Okay, and does that seem to help or?
[patient]  A little bit, yeah, a little bit. I mean, it's still like, you know, sort of touch, but it definitely dulls a little bit.
[doctor]  Well, sounds like you have quite a few projects going on, what all are you doing for your yard? And...
[patient]  I will let's see I've been putting an outdoor shower and we're extending our patio putting making some flower boxes putting down some you know for stone and all the flower beds so my wife's really put me to work I got a laundry lift
[doctor]  Wow, it sounds like a variety of projects, but if you're putting down stone, you're probably lifting those as well. And then...
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  Yai Bet that is sore now. Tell me this have you experienced any numbness in your arm or your hands or?
[patient]  No not really no numbness that I can think of.
[doctor]  Okay, all right. So CM and I'd like to do just a quick physical exam and I've reviewed your vitals, those look good, you're no fever. So that's good, you're 97. 8. And your heart rate looks good at 62 respirations, 16, your blood pressures, 116 over 84 that looks fine, your oxygen saturation is real good at 99%. So that all looks good. So let's take a look at your left at your right shoulder. So you have limited active and passive range of motion and there is some tenderness at the great tuberosity of the humerus. There's no tenderness at the sternoclavicular or acroecromioclavicular joints you do have a good hand grip. Okay, and on neurovascular exam of your right arm, your capillary refill is less than three seconds and your sensation to touch is intact. So I've reviewed the results of your shoulder x-ray and there is no fracture. So that's good. So let me tell you a little bit about my assessment and planned. So for your first problem, the right shoulder pain, your symptoms are most likely due to this rotator cuff rotator cuff tendonopathy. That means you that you injured, injured the tendons of the muscles that help make your shoulder muscles. I think we had to go ahead and ordered just an MRI since you have had some problems before as well to make sure there's nothing else going on with it. And I also want to refer you to physical therapy for approximately six to eight weeks. And so during that time, continue the Tylenol and if your symptoms don't improve, we can go ahead and consider a steroid injection of your shoulder, which could provide. Some relief. Do you have any questions about your plan?
[patient]  No, that sounds good.
[doctor]  Okay, all right, yeah, a lot of patients, it's very successful with the physical therapy, so I really hope that we'll do it. And so we'll just start there, okay.
[patient]  Sounds great.
[doctor]  Okay, thanks.
[patient]  Thanks.
[doctor]  Did you have any other, any other problems, any other injuries that went along with this or?
[patient]  My both my my feet are actually really sore too. I obviously have been doing a lot of other yard work. So, you know, it's kind of really stiff and stuff. And then you know my ankle joints as well. My wife seems to think that I don't drink enough water. So it could be something along that lines. But I don't know they're kind of this. They're just really sore and stuff. So I've been trying to put them up and kind of put ice on them. Keep them elevated and it seems to be helping out a little bit. But...
[doctor]  Yes, so if you don't feel that you did anything to injure it, we might start just maybe do some Epsom salts. Have you tried soaking your feet in Epsom salts that will tend to kind of pull out what's going on in there and just help you those muscles to relax and the soreness to go away you might try that?
[patient]  Okay, that sounds like a plan that sounds good.","CHIEF COMPLAINT

RESULTS

3 views of the right shoulder were taken. These reveal no fracture or dislocation. No abnormalities noted.

ASSESSMENT

1. Right shoulder rotator cuff tendinopathy.
2. Bilateral foot pain.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. I have explained to him that his x-rays did not reveal any signs of a fracture. I have recommended that we obtain an MRI of the right shoulder to evaluate for a possible rotator cuff tear. I have also recommended that the patient attend formal physical therapy for 6 to 8 weeks. He can continue taking Tylenol as needed for pain. If his symptoms do not improve with physical therapy, I will recommend a cortisone injection.

In regards to his bilateral feet pain, I have recommended that we treat the patient conservatively. I am recommending the patient soak his feet in an Epsom salt soak as well as elevate as needed.

[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  And I've tried so many things and just nothing seems to work.
[doctor]  I'm sorry to hear that now do you remember what caused the pain initially?
[patient]  You know, I never fell or was an accident, but I do remember it all happened like I started having back pain after I was moving furniture one weekend.
[doctor]  Okay, and now can you describe the pain for me?
[patient]  It feels like a sharp stabbing pain in my back and it does go down, even down in my right leg. Sometimes all the way down to my toe, it feels like my big toe.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  And I also feel like I just can't get comfortable, which is worse when I sit down, okay, yeah.
[doctor]  Okay now with that do you have any numbness or tingling associated with your back pain.
[patient]  Yeah, I do get some numbness and tingling especially to my right leg that goes down to my foot.
[doctor]  Okay.

[doctor]  Okay sure so tell me what is your day like.
[patient]  My day, so I try to be as active as I can, but of course it's been difficult with my back pain. And so because of that I have gained some weight over the past years.

[patient]  Yeah, and you know golf is relatively new for me. I've been trying to get into it, but this has definitely set me back.
[doctor]  yeah i'm sorry yet probably now at the peak of you know just learning it and being able to do more with it this comes and this happens right
[patient]  Exactly.
[doctor]  Well, let's see what we can do for you here. So you can go out into the You Know the Golf Course again. Now, do you tell me do you have any family members with spine conditions?
[patient]  No, I can't recall any family members.
[doctor]  Okay alright, and do you smoke?
[patient]  Not now, I quit about 20 years ago.
[doctor]  Okay, all right, well, all right, well, I like to do a quick physical exam on you here.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  I'm going to go ahead here, I reviewed your vitals and they overall look pretty good. So that's a good sign now on your musculoskeletal back exam. There is no overlying erythema and that just means redness or echinosis and that just means bruising of the skin now there is midline tenderness at L4 L5 disc space with right-sided lumbar paravertibral tenderness. So do me a favor and I'm going to just have you know bend forward and straighten up a bit.
[patient]  Okay, that's painful.
[doctor]  Sorry, so definitely some pain with lumbar flexion and supine straight leg test is positive. So on your neurological examination there is decreased sensation to light touch at the right lateral thigh at all for dermatome, okay? And I'm just going to take a look at your knees here real quick and then your ankles so patellar and Achilles reflexes are symmetrical so good. Now I reviewed the results of your MRI and it shows disc herniation with nerve impingement. So let me tell you about my assessment and plan here Larry so for your problem of chronic lumbar back pain so based on your symptoms your exam and reviewing your MRI results your symptoms are consistent with an l4l5 herniated disc with radical reticulopathy. So this means that one of your discs that sits between your spinal vertebrae is bulging out and this bulge is pinching on some nerves and that's why you feel that tingling in your leg. So yay so I am recommending a spinal injection with a strong inflammatory medication called a corticosteroid and what I do is I will inject the corticosteroid into that lumbar spine under fluoroscopy which you can think of you know an x-ray to help localize to the exact area of your pain now this should this should help the inflammation that is causing the pain. So what do you think about that?
[patient]  Is there something I'm going to have to do all the time?
[doctor]  Well, you know patients are different, so what we do is we will monitor you and we see how you respond to the injection, and the patient's intervals can be different as well, but we usually do not do more than four times a year.
[patient]  Okay, okay.
[doctor]  Alright, and it's not a long procedure, it's relatively quick and common, and you should be out of the office within an hour.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  Alright, sounds good.
[doctor]  Alright, well let's go ahead and get you started on the first one today if that works for you if not we'll get you scheduled to start your first injection.
[patient]  All right, thank you.
[doctor]  All right, thank you.
[patient]  Bye.","HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

aci,ACI107,"[doctor]  Alright, so hey, it's nice to see you, Jack. I know you've been experiencing some neck pain. Could you tell me what happened?
[patient]  Yeah, so I was an A car accident.
[doctor]  Hmm.
[patient]  And I hid in the back and my neck went forward and my head went forward really quick and so I've been having some pain ever since.
[doctor]  Okay, and so, with this pain how long ago was the car accident?
[patient]  That was about a week ago.
[doctor]  Okay, with this pain like on a scale of 1 to 10, how severe is it?
[patient]  I would say it's about a seven.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  It's not a constant pain, but whenever I move my head, which is like a lot I feel it.
[doctor]  Alright so, where exactly is it on the side on the back?
[patient]  It's in the back of my neck.
[doctor]  Okay, has anything made it better?
[patient]  I mean, I've tried some ibuprofen to help a little bit, but not too much.
[doctor]  Hmm.
[patient]  just about 5 out of 10.
[doctor]  Don't worry, and did you say whether the pain was getting worse?
[patient]  I mean it's been staying the same, it just gets worse when I'm moving my neck.
[doctor]  Okay are you able to turn your neck from side to side?
[patient]  Mostly, but there is there is pain with it.
[doctor]  Okay, and then, do you have headaches?
[patient]  Yeah, I had a couple early on.
[doctor]  Ah, ah.
[patient]  I've had it lately.
[doctor]  Okay, and so does the pain move anywhere like your upper back your shoulder.
[patient]  No, it just stays on Monday.
[doctor]  Okay, and then any kind of hearing, any kind of hearing problems, visual disturbances.
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Okay, have you ever played sports before or had a sports accident before?
[patient]  Yeah, I played football.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  Years ago, but I didn't have any issues with my neck though.
[doctor]  Okay, and then when you got in the car accident, did you end up going to the emergency room?
[patient]  No, I mean I know that going to the emergency room that like the English rides like 500 bucks, so I didn't want to do that.
[doctor]  I understand I understand okay. Was there any like swelling or bruising on your neck?
[patient]  Not that I know about no other mag of my neck, I really can't see that.
[doctor]  Yeah, okay, no just checking, okay. So if you don't mind, I'm going to go ahead and do my physical exam. So when I press on here on the side of your neck, does it hurt?
[patient]  Yeah, a little bit.
[doctor]  OK positive pain to palpation of the soft tissues of the neck, what about when I press on your back or your shoulders?
[patient]  Now that's fine.
[doctor]  Okay, so when you flex your neck, when you're touching your chin to your chest does that hurt?
[patient]  MM
[doctor]  Alright, positive pain with flexion. What about when you move it back?
[patient]  Yeah, that hurts worse.
[doctor]  Okay, okay, severe positive pain to extension okay. So can you turn your head from side to side? Does that hurt?
[patient]  Yeah, a little bit.
[doctor]  OK, positive pain with rotation, and then can you touch your ear to your shoulders.
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Okay, all right, so positive pain on lateral bending. Wow, this is pretty, this is pretty serious, not serious necessarily sorry about that. So I reviewed the results of your x-ray, but the results show no signs of fracture or bony abnormalities. But let's go ahead and talk about my assessment and plan for you. I believe what you have is something called next strain for your neck pain. I sorry treatments. We are going to go ahead and treat this a bit. Conservatively, you're I'm going to put you on anti-inflammatories. Motron 600 milligrams and you're going to take that every six to eight hours. I also want to give you a muscle relaxant called flexural and it's going to be 10 milligrams and you'll take that every 12 hours is needed. I'm going to want you to try your best to like relax your neck. I'm sorry not to strain your neck anymore. Like to be conservative with how you move about and everything like that. I also want to order an MRI just because you said you didn't go to the hospital or anything like that. I just want to make sure that you're not suffering from like a concussion, but this is something that's commonly referred to as like whiplash, right? Your head just like it. It just wiped essentially like back and forth to so severely. And that's probably what's causing your pain. I think I want to refer you to either physical rehab or a chiropractor once we get the results of the MRI just to make sure that there isn't any impingement of like the nerves or anything like that. Do you have any questions?
[patient]  I heard the chiropractors will shake they work.
[doctor]  I do understand that some people have like reservations about going to the chiropractor, but you know we do have some good ones that have like longstanding histories and patients that have had positive results from the experience. But if you if you don't like the idea of that we can consider other options like that rehab and physical therapy.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  All right, any other questions?
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  All right, thank you.","CHIEF COMPLAINT
