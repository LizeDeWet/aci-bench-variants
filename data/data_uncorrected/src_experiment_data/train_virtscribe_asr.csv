virtscribe,VS006,"[doctor]  Next patient is Christine Hernandez. Date of birth is January 13, 1982. Hey, Miss Christine, how are you doing today?
[patient]  I'm good thanks how are you?
[doctor]  I'm pretty good. So it looks like you've completed the COVID vaccine. That's great.
[patient]  Yes, I did.
[doctor]  Anything new since your last visit?
[patient]  No, I did all the tests that you had recommended me to take. I haven't been able to take the thyroid medicine. The one that you prescribed as I'm still taking my old one, the price is a little high on the new one.
[doctor]  Okay, so, did... did you try the coupon that I gave you?
[patient]  I did not try the coupon. There was a charge of $75.
[doctor]  Okay, well next time that, that coupon should help, but it should only be about $3.
[patient]  Okay, I don't have it. Do you happen to have another one you can give me?
[doctor]  Yep, right here.
[patient]  Wonderful. Thank you so much and and then the gel they are charging me $100 for it. So I don't know if this is because it's a it's Walmart or if I should try somewhere else or maybe you know how or where I could get a cheaper.
[doctor]  Yeah, let's try something else. Sometimes it can be cheaper if we just prescribe you the individual ingredients of a medication rather than the combined medication itself.
[patient]  That would be great.
[doctor]  So that's Clinton, Mice and Gel and Benzlal Paroxide, maybe by doing them separately. They could be a lot cheaper so that we can do the Unitroid with the discount code should only be about $9 for 90 days.
[patient]  Okay, that would be great. Yeah, they were charging me $75 and I just couldn't pay that.
[doctor]  Maybe we try a different pharmacy as well.
[patient]  Okay, so do you think that my weight gain could have been the birth control that I was taking before that cost it?
[doctor]  Maybe. I don't really see an endocrine cause for it at least, so I would need to see that the hyper and dragonism, or high testosterone, or a high DHEA to cause acne or hair growth or any of that stuff. But the numbers aren't showing about a range.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  I really don't see any endocrine cause for it. Like I said, your growth hormone was fine, but we definitely want to and need to treat it. I don't know if we talked about maybe a little weight loss study.
[patient]  You mentioned the weight loss study, and you mentioned that I have some meal plans that you had given me. I still have those too.
[doctor]  Have you tried to make any changes in the diet since the last time we spoke?
[patient]  I'm trying to get better. I will start back at the gym in July, because of my contract, I had to put a hold on it until then.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  So I don't want to start doing that. I will be a little freer since I'll be on vacation after July 8th.
[doctor]  Okay, good.
[patient]  And then my cousin was telling me to ask you about CLA because it's supposed to help your metabolism. Is that okay to take?
[doctor]  I'm not sure. What is the CLA?
[patient]  I'm not sure what it is either.
[doctor]  Okay. Well, I'm unfamiliar with it. So...
[patient]  Okay, I also have a co-worker who has a thyroid issue too, and she suggested to try chromium for weight loss.
[doctor]  so that likely will not help too much. You could try it either if you really want to, but then they will not accept you into the weight loss study if you try those too.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Chromium is just a supplement and it won't help that much.
[patient]  It won't okay, thank you.
[doctor]  It won't hurt like I shouldn't say that it won't hurt, but it also won't help that much. So it's up to you.
[patient]  Okay, and so my cousin also suggested amino acids and that I might find them in certain foods, I guess, for my workout.
[doctor]  Yeah, amino acids are fine. They won't really help with weight loss either, but it might help you replenish and just kind of feel hydrated.
[patient]  Okay, are they proteins? My cousin said she had lost some weight and has been working out every day, but she doesn't work, so I don't know.
[doctor]  Yes, I mean acids are what make up the protein, which is in any food you eat with any protein, so meat, dairy, nuts, any of that sort of thing.
[patient]  Okay, thank you got it.
[doctor]  All right, are you allergic to any medications?
[patient]  No, not that I know of.
[doctor]  Okay. Is your skin pretty sensitive?
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  Alright.
[patient]  Yeah, on my sides, I will start getting rashes with different products.
[doctor]  And have you ever tried clindamycin topical as an antibiotic for your acne?
[patient]  No, I've never tried anything for it.
[doctor]  Okay. We may give you some of that.
[patient]  Okay, and I also want to mention that my feet do swell up a lot.
[doctor]  Okay, I'm going to take a look at that for just a moment. Any constipation?
[patient]  Yes, I also do have that problem.
[doctor]  Alright, Miralax will definitely help with that.
[patient]  Okay, yes, my doctor did also recommend that.
[doctor]  Great! Alright, let's do an exam real quick. Please have a seat on this table and I'm going to listen to your lungs and heart.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Alright, deep breath alright again.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Alright sounds good.
[patient]  Great!
[doctor]  Let me take a look at your feet and ankles.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Alright, they look okay right now. Certainly let your doctor know about this if it gets any worse or reacurs.
[patient]  Okay, I'll do that.
[doctor]  Now, let's go over your lab work. So when you took that pill, the Dexamethasone test you passed, which means you don't have crushing syndrome on that test at least. The salivary cortisol, though, unless you did one wrong, two of them were completely normal. One was abnormal, so we might need to repeat that in the future.
[patient]  Okay, that's okay.
[doctor]  Alright, so your cholesterol was quite high. The total cholesterol was 222. Good cholesterol was about 44. The bad was 153. And it should be less than 100. The non-HDL was about 178. And it should be less than 130. The good cholesterol should be over 50. And it was 44. So your screening for diabetes is fine. You do have a vitamin D deficiency. And I don't know if we started the vitamin D yet or not.
[patient]  Yes, we did. I... I don't need to take one today, though.
[doctor]  Okay, so I also checked a lot of other pituitary hormones, iron levels, everything else seemed to be pretty good, and in decent range.
[patient]  Okay, that sounds great. So I wanted to also show you my liver enzymes because I haven't come back since then, but I was also happy because one of them was back to normal.
[doctor]  Okay, great. Let's see them.
[patient]  Okay, so the one that's 30, that was almost 200, not so long ago.
[doctor]  Yeah, your alt was about 128.
[patient]  Okay, and back in October it was 254.
[doctor]  Yeah, this is much better.
[patient]  Okay, great. And then it dropped in January, and then it dropped a little more in March since I stopped taking the medicine in December.
[doctor]  Okay, that's good. So I'm proud of you with the course of your labs. So before I forget, I'm going to just put your labs into the computer today and I won't be checking your vitamin D level for some time.
[patient]  Okay, so with the thyroid and the low vitamin D, does that always happen together?
[doctor]  I do have a lot of people that have thyroid thyroid issues and they have vitamin D deficiency.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  This is what I'm going to do. I'm going to put print out your prescription so you can shop around at the pharmacies and see if you can find better prices.
[patient]  Okay, that way I can go ask them and try CVS.
[doctor]  Yeah, that sounds like a plan.
[patient]  Okay, good. So the weight loss study that you mentioned, when does that start or how does that work?
[doctor]  So we are about to start as we just got approval last week and we are just waiting on our paperwork so we can get started.
[patient]  Okay, and what's involved with that?
[doctor]  So it'll involve you receiving a medication which has been used for diabetes treatment and it works mostly in the gut on satiety or satiety hormones. The most common side effects are going to be nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and constipation. There are six arms to the study. One is the placebo. The other ones are various, various dosages of the medication. Excuse me. You would receive an injection once a week, also keep in mind that most of the weight loss medications are not covered by insurance.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  So it's a way of getting them, but the odds of getting one of the arms with the medication that are in your favor, right, might be only one out of five of our 100 patients that we have on the list for the study that will receive the placebo.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Does that make sense?
[patient]  Yes, it does.
[doctor]  So we do expect pretty big weight loss because of what we learn in the diabetes study. So it's a year-long process and it's an injection once a week. You come in weekly for the first four or five weeks, I believe, and then after that it's once a month. You do get a stipend for participating in the study and parking is validated and whatever else that you need for the study.
[patient]  Okay, do you know how much the skypawn is?
[doctor]  I will have to double check for you and you don't have to be my patient. You just have to meet the criteria, so the criteria is a BMI greater than 30. If you don't have any other medical condition or a BMI greater than 27, if you do have other medical condition like your cholesterol BMI greater than 27 would qualify you.
[patient]  I have a friend who might be interested and she does have diabetes.
[doctor]  If she has the diabetes, then she won't qualify.
[patient]  Okay, you can't if you, if you have diabetes, got it.
[doctor]  Correct. Yeah, the only thing that they cannot have really is diabetes, severe psychiatric disease, or schizophrenia by polar things like that.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  But if they have hypertension, high cholesterol, things like that, they can definitely sign up.
[patient]  and they can. Okay, thank you for explaining that.
[doctor]  Of course, so do you want me to try to get you into that study or would you just like to try me to prescribe you something it's kind of up to you?
[patient]  I think I'll just wait for a little bit now.
[doctor]  All right, sounds good. I'll give you the information for the research. It's just in my office. It is a different phone number though, so then if you're interested, just call us within a month because I don't know how long the weight will be.
[patient]  Okay, we will do.
[doctor]  Perfect. So let me go grab your discount card for the Unitroid. When you go in to activate it, the instructions are on this card and then you use your insurance. Then show them this and ask how much it will cost. If it's too expensive, just let me know.
[patient]  I will. Thank you so much for your help on that.
[doctor]  You're welcome. Then what I did is I gave you a topical antibiotic plus I gave you the benzal peroxide, so the peroxide may bleach your sheets. But you want to make sure to take it and apply it at night so you don't have a reaction from the sun during the day.
[patient]  Okay, I can do that.
[doctor]  But you do also want to make sure that you don't mess up your sheets.
[patient]  Okay, sounds good.
[doctor]  So that's that, and then let's see how you do on the other medications. I think this will get better. In the meantime, a low-carb diet, avoid alcohol and fatty foods and low cholesterol foods.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  And again, once you finish your dose of vitamin D for the vitamin D deficiency, you're going to start with the 2000 International Units daily so that you're able to maintain those levels sound good.
[patient]  Yes, that sounds great.
[doctor]  I really think your liver enzymes are going to get better once you lose the weight though.
[patient]  Okay, that'll be great.
[doctor]  Since we stopped your birth control, we can try one called fexi, which is kind of like a spermicide basically.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  and you just apply it before intercourse.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  If you need some, just let me know.
[patient]  Okay, I will, I will let you know.
[doctor]  Okay, perfect. So stay put for me now. I'm going to go see if they have a discount samples and bring you that prescription. And then I'm going to order the labs for next time.
[patient]  Okay, great. Thank you so much.
[doctor]  You're welcome. So under the plan, under abnormal liver enzymes, they have improved since discontinuation of her birth control. Under abnormal weight gain, her dexamethasone suppression test was normal. Two out of three solid choral tests were normal, not consistent with cushings, and therefore, ruling out cushings. Under her hersutism, her androgen levels were normal. For the acne vulgaris, the epigewa was not covered. So we will try benzoyl peroxide with clindamycin and remove the previous information on the hypothyroidism. We will print out her prescriptions unithyroid should be better priced with the discount card, and we will repeat levels of everything before next visit. Thanks.","CHIEF COMPLAINT

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Christine Hernandez is a 39-year-old female who presents today for evaluation and management of abnormal liver enzymes and hypothyroidism.

When the patient was last seen, her thyroid medicine was changed to Unithroid, but due to the cost of $75, she has not yet started the new medicine and continues taking her previous thyroid medicine. She denies utilizing the coupon that was previously recommended for the Unithroid. Similarly, the patient was prescribed Epiduo for her acne vulgaris, which she did not fill due to the cost of $100. She tried filling both prescriptions at Walmart.

Mrs. Hernandez still presents with abnormal weight gain. She questioned if her oral contraceptive Microgestin, which was discontinued, could have been the cause. Additional symptoms included acne, hirsutism. She is attempting to modify her intake and plans to resume her gym membership in July as she will be on vacation. She inquired about the impact on weight loss of chromium, CLA, and amino acids.

The patient confirmed that she is taking her high dose Vitamin D as prescribed. She does suffer from constipation and she treats with MiraLAX.

She denies previous treatment for her acne vulgaris. She denies ever using clindamycin topical antibiotic. She reports having sensitive skin, developing rashes with various skin products.

PLAN

Hypothyroidism
The patient will again attempt to initiate Unithroid. I have printed out the prescription and a discount card, which should result in a reduced price. She will contact my office if she encounters additional issues.

Abnormal liver enzymes
We have seen improvement since the discontinuation of Microgestin. I recommended the spermicide Phexxi for alternative birth control. The patient will also continue working on weight loss, which should additionally improve her liver enzymes.

Abnormal weight gain
Cushing’s Syndrome has been ruled out. I reviewed the weight loss study with the patient, she will call within a month if she is interested in participating. I advised her to follow a low carbohydrate, low cholesterol, abstain from alcohol, and reduce fatty foods diet.

Acne vulgaris
Epiduo was not covered and too expensive. The patient will try benzoyl peroxide and Clindamycin separately to see if the price improves.

Vitamin D deficiency
The patient will complete the high dose vitamin D and then should start vitamin D 2000 IU per day to maintain her levels.

Hirsutism
Her androgen levels were normal.

INSTRUCTIONS

virtscribe,VS010,"[patient]  Next patient is Nicole Miller. Data birth is September 18, 1949. Patient was called for a follow up with me for chronic congestive heart failure with diastolic dysfunction. BNP has been 3,000 in March and is about six was up to 6,000 in April. She was increasingly dyspneic. We changed her furostomide and torsomide 20 milligrams by mouth daily. To note the patient is not currently on potassium supplement. Her lycinopryl has also been increased up to 10 milligrams daily in March. Also, when I saw her in last April, she had reported being interested in having her right knee replace this summer at East Metro. So it was recommended that we work to control her cardiovascular status before surgery.
[doctor]  Hey Miss Miller, how are you today?
[patient]  I'm doing okay. Thank you.
[doctor]  I asked you to come in today because we want to keep, we want you to have this knee surgery this summer, but we want to keep a close eye on you to make sure a week before your surgery. You don't suddenly go into congestive heart failure and it gets postponed.
[patient]  Yeah, that would not be good.
[doctor]  I see your scheduled on the 24th for surgery.
[patient]  Yeah, that's right.
[doctor]  Okay, good. Well, it looks like you have lost about 3, 3 and a half pounds since I saw you last in April. Some of that might be water weight, but still this is positive.
[patient]  Yeah, I noticed that too. I think the Oxebutinin is helping as well. My urgency to use the bathroom is much better.
[doctor]  Well, that's great.
[patient]  Yeah, I'm pleased about it too.
[doctor]  Do you ever get leg or finger cramps or anything like that?
[patient]  Yeah, I had leg cramps the other day, but I thought it might was maybe just because I was cold as I had my ceiling fan on and fell asleep. I had cramps when I woke up in both legs right here. I drank pickle juice and it went right away.
[doctor]  Well, don't. Don't go crazy with the pill juice because of all the salt in it.
[patient]  Well, I know. I only drink about four ounces or so.
[doctor]  Okay, good.
[patient]  It went away, so I didn't drink anymore. I find it works a lot better than trying to put some cream on my leg.
[doctor]  Sure, just keep it in moderation.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  And then are you still on an iron supplement? And are you using the bathroom okay?
[patient]  Yes, everything is good.
[doctor]  Good. How is your heartburn doing? Any problems with that?
[patient]  No, it did get bad for a while. So I tried to take some Prylasek and then stop that other one.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  I did that for like gosh, I think it was two weeks back in January and haven't had any problems since.
[doctor]  Great!
[patient]  And after I start taking that I went back to the stomach one. So I'm doing good now.
[doctor]  Okay, and you're still due for a colonoscopy, correct?
[patient]  Yeah, that's right.
[doctor]  Alright, let's review your blood work real quick. I checked your hemoglobin level because you have had some anemia in the past, but that is still doing great.
[patient]  Good, that's a relief to hear.
[doctor]  Your potassium is 3.9, so it's holding steady on the torsimide. Your creatinine was 0.7, 9.8, so you're doing well with kidney numbers. You're your bun.
[patient]  Maybe a tiny bit elevated at 23, which the number we look for for dehydration, sometimes the kidneys, but it's not terrible.
[doctor]  So when I look at your numbers as a whole, I think you're tolerating the torsimide okay at the current dose. I also sent out to look at the heart failure number. I sent out to look at your heart failure number.
[patient]  There's a test called a B&P that I was monitoring, and in March it was up to 3000, and then went up to 6000 in April before I made the change, and I'm still waiting for those results. Okay.
[doctor]  All in all I think you're doing good on paper though.
[patient]  What about what's a call they one see does that show up?
[doctor]  I don't think I ordered it, but I could. Your last A1C was 5.5 in March.
[patient]  Already.
[doctor]  So your blood sugar is a little bit high. It was 169 today, but that kind of depends on what you ate and you weren't fasting for the blood check. So I might have to repeat that test for pre-op, but I don't think we need to do it today.
[patient]  Alrighty, that sounds good. I check your magnesium level because sometimes you you urinate out magnesium and with the water pills, but it was normal at 1.7 in your your blood pressure is also looking good. Okay great, that all sounds awesome.
[doctor]  Alright, let's take a quick listen. Use my general physical exam template and take a couple of deep breaths for me. Your lungs sound pretty good to me. So keep doing what you're doing like I said. I think you're doing good overall, but let's just talk about a few things.
[patient]  Alrighty.
[doctor]  So, we often like to keep people with heart problems on magnesium.
[patient]  and get their levels up to around the two ish range. Yours is a little bit less than two, and we want that two ish range because it can help stabilize the heart muscle. So I might recommend putting you on a magnesium supplement. It's to be twice a day, so that's kind of annoying. But I know you're on other medicines twice a day too, so I think you do fine. Yeah, that will be okay. Great now before surgery. We'll have to get you off your clopidigral for a week beforehand. Yes, okay. I have everything written down on my phone, and I have a letter taped aside of my bed to remind me.
[doctor]  Perfect. We will give you a reminder as well. We will also need to complete a pre-op check within two weeks after surgery during the first or second week of June.
[patient]  Okay, I'll put that down. You might also have to repeat an EKG before surgery, which we could do today. I know I'm sure it feels like you're doing, you're always doing EKGs, we don't need to do any X-rays of your chest because you had one recently and we don't need any more blood work because we did that today. Yeah, I do a lot of EKGs. I'm basically a regular, but I'm happy to do one today, no problem.
[doctor]  Lastly, once we get your knee surgery, we should think about getting you a colonoscopy. We can do it here locally because you have Medicare. Do you have private insurance also?
[patient]  Yeah, I have both.
[doctor]  Okay, so yes, you can get it your colonoscopy wherever you'd like. Okay, well my husband's insurance may be running out. Might we be able to get the procedure done sooner maybe in the next 30 days? Is that okay?
[patient]  I could put in right now for for counting for the next 30 days and then might be able to get you in within the next few weeks. It should not take it should not make you an eligible for the surgery. In other words, completing the colonoscopy would not delay your surgery.
[doctor]  Okay good.
[patient]  So let me see, I've been doing one of two things and everyone and everyone is great, so it depends more on timing and availability of there, or for the colonoscopy, we can send you to Dr. Martin for the surgery, who is at county surgical services down here, or the other option is valley medical, and they do it Springfield.
[doctor]  Okay, that sounds good.
[patient]  I think either direction they're good technicians of the colon okay. Yeah, whatever you can get me in, that works great.
[doctor]  So I'll call around now if you get that done and they tell you 10 years then you'll be good to go.
[patient]  Great, thank you.
[doctor]  You're welcome. Have a great day and let us know if you need anything else. Okay.
[patient]  Sounds good. All right, assessment and plan, chronic CHF, mixed presentation, had an exacerbation of CF CHF earlier in the spring. We switch her from a ferozomide to torsomide, and symptomatically, she's doing a lot better. She's about three, three, one, slash two pounds down in weight. Breathing is non-labored and going to repeat EKG today, but otherwise continue her current regimen. Labs checked and creatinine is appropriate. Number two, pre-op examination. She is, she is having a right knee replacement in a June. Also, she would like to have a colonoscopy performed, which we will try to have done a county hospital in the next month prior to a change in her insurance. This is just a screening colonoscopy that she is overdue for. No family history of colon cancer. The next one is...
[doctor]  diabetes. A1c is 5.1 on the last check, so no need for further A1c today. She may need another one prior to her surgery next month though. Thanks.","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Follow-up.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Nicole Miller is a 71-year-old female who presents for follow-up. The patient was called in for a follow up with me for chronic congestive heart failure with diastolic dysfunction. Her BNP had been 3000 in 03/2021, up to 6000 in 04/2021. She was increasingly dyspneic. We had changed her furosemide to torsemide at 20 mg by mouth daily. The patient is not on a potassium supplement currently. Her lisinopril had also been increased up to 10 mg daily in 03/2021.

I last saw her in 04/2021, and she had reported being interested in having her right knee replaced this summer at East Metropolitan Hospital, so it was recommended that we work to control her cardiovascular status prior to surgery. She is currently scheduled to have surgery on 06/24/2021. She plans to discontinue clopidogrel a week before her surgery.

The patient states that she has lost approximately 3 to 3.5 pounds since her last visit in 04/2021. Some of which may be water weight decreasing. She did report experiencing bilateral leg cramps which she treated with consumption of pickle juice, which did resolve the cramps. She thought the cramps were related to her being cold.

She is still taking iron supplementation. She denies any concerns with defecation.

Regarding her prior symptoms of heartburn, she denies any recent gastrointestinal issues. She notes that her heartburn was severe at one point but resolved after trying Prilosec for 2 weeks in 01/2021. She denies any issues with heartburn since that time and has stopped taking Prilosec altogether. She has since transitioned back to her original ""stomach medication"".

The patient is due for a colonoscopy. She is currently double covered with Medicare and private insurance.

PAST HISTORY

Medical
Chronic Congestive Heart Failure.
Iron deficiency Anemia.

Medications
Prilosec.

FAMILY HISTORY

No family history of colon cancer.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

Torsemide 20 mg by mouth daily.
Lisinopril 10 mg daily.

RESULTS

Magnesium 1.7, hemoglobin WNL, potassium 3.9, creatinine 0.7, BUN 23.
03/2020 Hgb A1c 5.5.

ASSESSMENT

• Chronic congestive heart failure with mixed presentation.
• Preop examination.
• Diabetes mellitus.
• Colonoscopy

PLAN

Chronic congestive heart failure with mixed presentation.
She had an exacerbation of CHF earlier in the spring. We switched her from furosemide to torsemide and symptomatically, she is doing a lot better. She is about 1.5 kg down in weight. Her breathing is nonlabored. We are going to repeat an EKG today. Otherwise, continue her current regimen. Labs were checked and creatinine is appropriate. Her magnesium is below the preferred 2 at 1.7, with some occurrence of bilateral leg cramping, therefore we will start her on magnesium supplement.

Preop examination.
She is going to be having a right knee replacement at the end of 06/2021. We will schedule a preop check the first week or two of June prior to the surgery. She will discontinue clopidogrel for one week prior to knee replacement surgery; we will provide a reminder to patient of this as well.

Diabetes mellitus.
A1c is 5.5 on last check, so there is no need for a further A1c today. She may need another one prior to her surgery next month.

Colonoscopy.
The patient is overdue for a colonoscopy, which we will try to have done at County Hospital in the next month, prior to a change in her insurance. This is just a screening colonoscopy that she is overdue for. No family history of colon cancer.

The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

INSTRUCTIONS

Complete EKG today. Schedule a preop checkup 1st or 2nd week of June. Start magnesium supplement. Call the clinic with any questions or new symptoms.

[patient]  Yes, I am.
[doctor]  Hi, my name is Dr. Edwards. Nice to meet you.
[patient]  Nice to meet you.
[doctor]  Welcome to the GI Specialty Clinic.
[patient]  Thank you.
[doctor]  Did you have any problems finding this?
[patient]  No, I've been here with my sister once before.
[doctor]  Good, so how can I help you today? The referral I have is for Dominal Pain and Diarrhea.
[patient]  Right, so I've been having this pain right here in my stomach like right around here.
[doctor]  So in the area of your mid abdomen, just below the belly button.
[patient]  Correct. I've had the pain on and off for about two years. I finally went to the ER in a few months ago and they did a CT scan.
[doctor]  I saw that.
[patient]  Yeah, this said they didn't really see anything on the scan.
[doctor]  Yes, I agree it looked normal.
[patient]  and the problem is I'm either constipated or have explosive diarrhea.
[doctor]  Is the pain there all the time?
[patient]  It's a nagging feeling and it just depends. Sometimes it bothers me. Sometimes it doesn't.
[doctor]  Has this been the case over the past two years as well?
[patient]  More recently in the past couple of months, at least with the constipation and diarrhea.
[doctor]  And before that, how are your bowel movements?
[patient]  They were normal.
[doctor]  Okay, so any blood in your stool?
[patient]  Nope.
[doctor]  Do you feel like you have more constipation or diarrhea?
[patient]  Probably more constipation.
[doctor]  Okay, so when you're constipated, do you not have a bowel movement or is the stool hard?
[patient]  I usually don't go, but when I do, it's hard.
[doctor]  And how often do you have a bowel movement when you're constipated?
[patient]  About 3 to 4 times a week, it's like when I need to go to the bathroom if I can massage it. It feels like it's moving some and I can eventually go.
[doctor]  Okay, and when you have a bowel movement, does the pain change?
[patient]  Yeah, it gets a little better.
[doctor]  And are you eating and drinking okay? An inaja or vomiting, heartburn or indigestion?
[patient]  None of that.
[doctor]  Okay, so tell me about the diaria. How often do you get it?
[patient]  It kind of just depends on what I eat. I think I have a very sensitive stomach. If I eat pasta with a creamy sauce, I'm probably going to have diarrhea.
[doctor]  Okay, and does it happen for multiple days in a row? Or is it just one time?
[patient]  It's usually just one time and then it's over.
[doctor]  and how has your weight been any fluctuation?
[patient]  No, it's been pretty stable, although I could stand to lose about 25 pounds.
[doctor]  Okay, and is there any family history of GI issues that you know of?
[patient]  not that I can think of. Well, actually my sister does have problems with her stomach too. She has irritable bowel syndrome and that is kind of what I always thought. I had even though I have never been diagnosed with it.
[doctor]  Okay, and is there any family history of GI cancer or liver disease?
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Have you ever had any surgeries on your abdomen?
[patient]  I have never had any surgery.
[doctor]  Okay, so your gallbladder, appendix, all of those are still intact?
[patient]  Yep.
[doctor]  and have you ever had a colonoscopy?
[patient]  No, I thought that happened when you turned 50.
[doctor]  Well, that's for colon cancer screening, but there are other reasons to have a colonoscopy, like unexplained abdominal pain, and changes in bowel habits.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Well, come have a seat here and lay back so I can examine you.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  I'm going to start by listening to your belly with my stethoscope.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  And I hear vowel sounds in all four quadrants.
[patient]  What does that mean is everything okay?
[doctor]  It just means that I can hear little noises in all areas of your belly, which means your bowels are active and working.
[patient]  Okay, good.
[doctor]  So now I'm going to push on your upper and lower abdomen. Let me know if you have any pain.
[patient]  It hurts a little when you push right there on the left side, near my belly button.
[doctor]  Okay, I do feel stool in your lower colon, which would coincide with constipation, but I also feel a slight enlargement of your liver here on the upper right side. Have you had any lab work done recently?
[patient]  Yes, I had a physical about four months ago and then I had blood drawn then.
[doctor]  Okay, and did your primary care physicians say anything about the lab results?
[patient]  He said I had some very slightly elevated liver enzymes, but we would recheck them in about six months.
[doctor]  And do you remember what enzymes were elevated, ALT, AST, ALP?
[patient]  He said the all and the AST were elevated.
[doctor]  And do you take any medications either prescription or over the counter?
[patient]  I take Crestore and an Olmissarton Daily and then Tylenol for occasional, occasional pain.
[doctor]  And how frequently do you take the Tylenol?
[patient]  Hardly ever, maybe once a month.
[doctor]  And, do you consume alcohol?
[patient]  Yes, but only a couple of beers after working in the yard on Saturdays.
[doctor]  Okay, and no previous history of heavy alcohol or drug use.
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  And have you had any recent issues with excessive bruising or bleeding?
[patient]  Nope.
[doctor]  And how about any issues with your ankles or feet swelling?
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Okay, I'm gonna take a look at your eyes and skin. I don't see any jaundice.
[patient]  What would cause that?
[doctor]  Issues with your liver. Let me take a quick listen to your heart and lungs.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Lungs are clear bilateral. Hearts sounds are normal. No murmurs, gallops, or rubs noted.
[patient]  That's good.
[doctor]  Yes, the rest of your physical exam is normal other than what seems to be an increased stool burden in your colon and a slight hepatomegaly.
[patient]  What's that?
[doctor]  Increased stool burden means that there is a lot of stool sitting in your colon.
[patient]  And that's the constipation, right? But what about the other thing?
[doctor]  The hepatomegally means the liver is enlarged.
[patient]  But you said mom was slightly enlarged.
[doctor]  Correct.
[patient]  So what does that mean?
[doctor]  Well, let's talk about what we found, and then some possible next steps if you're in agreement.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  So, as I said, the heptomegally means your liver is enlarged.
[patient]  Could that be why my stomach is hurting and I'm having issues with the constipation and diarrhea?
[doctor]  No, I think you're constipated and have occasional bouts of diarrhea because of certain foods you eat, and we can get you started right away on a fiber supplement that should help with that.
[patient]  So what about my liver? Why is it enlarged?
[doctor]  Well, there are many reasons why people can have an elevated liver enzymes and also an enlarged liver. Some possible causes are certain medications that can be toxic to the liver. Alcohol abuse, fatty liver disease, hepatitis, cirrhosis, and other liver diseases like Wilson's disease.
[patient]  So what I need to do.
[doctor]  Well, I think since it's been about four months since your blood work was done, we should check your liver enzymes in addition to a few other labs.
[patient]  Okay, and then what?
[doctor]  We will get those drawn today, and then depending upon the results, you may need an ultrasound of your liver. I think we need to talk about your medications too.
[patient]  which medications?
[doctor]  Crestor, how long have you been taking that?
[patient]  about 18 months.
[doctor]  Okay, well, Crestor is one of the medications that can cause liver toxicity, so it may be a good idea to discuss other alternatives.
[patient]  Should I talk to my primary care, or can you change it?
[doctor]  I would recommend calling your primary care and discuss that with him since he follows you for your blood pressure and cholesterol.
[patient]  Okay, I'll call in this afternoon.
[doctor]  Great! I also think we should go ahead and get you scheduled for a liver ultrasound. If your blood work looks good, then we can always cancel that.
[patient]  Okay, when you think I'll be able to get the ultrasound done.
[doctor]  Hopefully within the next two weeks, you'll receive a call from the radiology scheduling this afternoon to get it set up.
[patient]  Okay, and then what happens?
[doctor]  When I get the results from the tests, I'll contact you and depending upon what we find, we'll come up with our next steps.
[patient]  And what should I see you again?
[doctor]  Let's schedule an appointment when you check out to return in four weeks. We'll discuss how you're doing with the Fiber Supplement and your constipation and review test results to determine if we need to do further testing on your liver.
[patient]  Okay, is there anything else I can do to help with these issues?
[doctor]  Definitely refrain from drinking any alcohol. Increase your water intake to at least 48 ounces a day. In addition to taking the fiber supplement to help with your constipation, and be mindful of eating foods that you are sensitive to so you can avoid the bouts of diarrhea.
[patient]  Okay, and I will talk to my primary care about my crestor.
[doctor]  Excellent. And do you have any other questions for me?
[patient]  I don't think so.
[doctor]  Great! So remember when you check out at the front desk, schedule a follow-up appointment with me for four weeks, and then go to the lab to get your blood work drawn.
[patient]  Okay, sounds good.
[doctor]  and expect a call from Radiology Scheduling about setting up your ultrasound.
[patient]  Alright, thanks Dr. Edwards.
[doctor]  Thank you Mr. Allen.","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Abdominal pain and diarrhea.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Patrick Allen is a 42-year-old male who presents for a new patient visit for chronic abdominal pain, constipation, and diarrhea.

Mr. Allen reports experiencing intermittent mid-abdominal pain for approximately 2 years. The pain is localized just inferior to the umbilicus and he describes it as a “nagging feeling” when it is present. The pain sometimes improves following a bowel movement. Unfortunately, Mr. Allen reports that the pain has been present more often in the past 2 months. In 01/2020, the patient presented to the emergency room due to the pain and underwent a CT scan.

In addition to the abdominal pain, Mr. Allen complains of constipation and episodic severe diarrhea for the past 2 months; however, he estimates that the constipation is more frequent than the diarrhea. When he is constipated, he has a bowel movement 3-4 times a week and the stools are hard. Regarding his diarrhea, he has noticed that it seems to be associated with certain foods. In particular, he notes that pasta with a creamy sauce is likely to prompt an episode of diarrhea. When this occurs, he usually has just 1 bowel movement of diarrhea and then it resolves. The patient states that, prior to 2 months ago, his bowel movements were normal. Mr. Allen notes that massaging his abdomen has sometimes been helpful in producing a bowel movement.

The patient’s last physical was 4 months ago, and he confirms that he did have bloodwork that day. Mr. Allen reports that his primary care provider notified him that his AST and ALT were mildly elevated and advised that they would need to recheck his liver enzymes in 6 months. The patient’s medication list includes Crestor and olmesartan daily and he estimates that he has been taking the Crestor for approximately 18 months. He also takes Tylenol as needed for pain, approximately once a month. The patient states that he drinks 2 beers once a week and denies a history of heavy alcohol or drug use. He also denies excessive bruising or bleeding and any lower extremity edema.

The patient denies blood in his stools, nausea, vomiting, heartburn, and indigestion. He confirms that he is eating and drinking normally, and his weight has been stable. He does acknowledge that he would like to lose 25 pounds, however. He has no family history of gastrointestinal cancer or liver disease; however, his sister has irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The patient has not had any prior abdominal surgeries and he has never had a colonoscopy.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Respiratory
Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.

Cardiovascular
No murmurs, gallops, or rubs.

Abdomen
Normoactive bowel sounds in all 4 quadrants. There is mild left periumbilical tenderness to palpation, mild hepatomegaly, and increased stool burden in colon.

RESULTS

CT of Abdomen, 01/23/2020.
Impression: Normal CT of abdomen.

ASSESSMENT

• Constipation
• Mild hepatomegaly

PLAN

Patrick Allen is a 42-year-old male who presents for a new patient visit for chronic abdominal pain, constipation, and diarrhea. The most likely etiology of his abdominal pain is constipation given his history, exam with increased stool burden, and normal abdominal CT. Mild hepatomegaly was also noted on exam today and the patient reportedly had elevated liver enzymes on labs with his primary care provider 4 months ago. The patient is currently on Crestor which may be contributing to his elevated liver enzymes. We discussed findings, diagnosis, and next steps at length.

Constipation
• Start daily fiber supplement and increase water consumption to at least 48 ounces daily to help with bowel regularity.
• Avoid trigger foods that may cause episodes of diarrhea.

Mild Hepatomegaly
• Repeat liver enzyme labs today.
• Schedule a liver ultrasound pending lab results.
• Encouraged to cease alcohol consumption.
• Patient to contact his PCP to discuss alternative medications.

INSTRUCTIONS

Return to clinic in 4 weeks.

virtscribe,VS016,"[doctor]  Eugene Walker date of birth April 14, 1960, he is a 61-year-old male who presents today for routine follow-up of his chronic medical conditions of note the patient underwent an aortic valve replacement and ascending aortic aneurysm repair on January 22, 2013 regarding his blood work from April 10, 2021. The patient's alkaline phosphatase, phosphatase, ismy was elevated to 156. His lipid panel showed elevated total cholesterol of 247 HDL of 66 LDL of 166 and triglycerides at 70 for the patient's TSH was normal at 2.68. His CBC was unremarkable. His most recent vitamin D level was at the high end of normal at 94. Good morning, Mr. Walker. How are you doing? I mean, has been a crazy year. I'm doing fine for the most part, but there are a few things on cover today, sure drawn ahead.
[patient]  Well, I'm having more fatigue, but I don't know if it's age or if it's just, you know, drain at the end of the day, but I still ride my bike. I can't go as fast as I used to. I'm still riding and, you know, after a long bike ride, I'll sit down and then boom, I'm out, you know.
[doctor]  Yeah, what's a long bike ride do you?
[patient]  20 to 30 miles.
[doctor]  20 to 30 miles on a road bike?
[patient]  Yeah, road bike. I think it's a time thing. If I have more time, I would try to do my 40 miles, but I haven't done that. Obviously, we're too early in the season. So my typical ride is like 2030. And years back, I could do 40 on a good day. I could still do 20, but you know I'm tired and have to take a break when I get home.
[doctor]  Yeah, I understand.
[patient]  And Tyler is my buddy. He is always nice and waits for me. But I used to be able to beat him, but now he waits for me all the time. He is older than me, and it kills me.
[doctor]  Yeah, I can imagine that would help set me to.
[patient]  The last time you know you found a hard thing then, just making sure that the valve is holding out.
[doctor]  Right, so when was your last stress test?
[patient]  It was September 9th, 2019 because I'm eight years out from surgery and back then they said, you know it's on the last eight years and I'm at that year. So I just want to make sure. I asked Dr. Lewis for an echocardiogram to see how I'm doing.
[doctor]  Yeah.
[patient]  But it's not like nothing has changed drastically since I saw you.
[doctor]  Okay good. Do you still go down the Hopkins at all?
[patient]  No, not at all. I just get follow-ups intermittently here. Going there is just as too much stress.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  Zero one more thing. I want to make sure I don't forget. My wife and friends tell me that when I walk, I purse my lips when I'm breathing. Other doctors have said, did you notice your purse lips breathing? I don't know if that's a bad habit or what.
[doctor]  Okay. Is there any weising associated with that?
[patient]  No, no reason.
[doctor]  And you're able to bike 30 miles and mostly keep up with your friends Tyler, correct?
[patient]  Yeah, the only other thing I want to mention is it's not like I do routine testicular exams, but I know I have this little nodule on my right testicle.
[doctor]  on the testicle or the epididimus.
[patient]  Epiditimus. I really don't know. I'm not super concerned or read a little online. Just wanted to ask you.
[doctor]  And did you have a vestectomy?
[patient]  No, let me pull my notes out and make sure I'm mentioned everything I want to tell you. Those are the only things and it's not like my tiredness is depression or anything. I'm a pretty happy guy overall, you know? I just know you would ask those questions.
[doctor]  What time are you going to sleep? And about how many hours do you sleep at night?
[patient]  It varies usually I get six to seven hours of sleep. I get out of bed some days to be at work by seven lecture, and I try to work out in the morning. I don't, I'm not, I'm not really successful, and now what I do is I, I do make reservations twice a week for 545 swim in the morning.
[doctor]  Okay, so you're getting six to seven hours of sleep and has your wife ever mentioned if you snore or stop breathing at any time.
[patient]  I believe I snore a little bit, but she has never said anything about me not breathing.
[doctor]  Okay, so you're currently taking vitamin D3 around 5,000 units on Sundays and 2,000 or 50,000 units on Sundays, excuse me, and 2,000 on the other six days, and then clindamycin prior to dental procedures, correct?
[patient]  Yeah, that's right.
[doctor]  Have you had a COVID-19 shot yet?
[patient]  I receive both. My first dose on January 15th, 2021, and my second on February 5th, 2021.
[doctor]  Good. If you hop up here on the table, we're just going to do a physical exam. Well, Mr. Walker, overall you're doing well, I'm going to order an echocardiogram and a stress test. I also recommend that you follow up with cardiology. I think Dr. Vincent Sanchez would be a great fit for you.
[patient]  Alright.
[doctor]  Also, your recent labs showed an elevated alkaline phosphatase level at 156. Now this could be related to your liver, but most likely related to your bone health we are going to check a few labs today.
[patient]  You're gonna have them done today?
[doctor]  Yes, sir. And we will send the results through your patient portal unless something is way off. And we'll give you a call sounds good now. As far as your breathing, I observe the per-slip breathing and your exhalation is low, I think you should do a pulmonary function test to further evaluate. And I would evaluate as well now the nodule in your right testicle should be evaluated by urology. And we will place that referral today also.
[patient]  Sounds like you're going to be busy getting this all checked out.
[doctor]  Yes, sir, now you're due for your MMR, and I'm recommending you get the shingles vaccine as well. You have completed your COVID-19, so that's good. Now I'm going to have you return in about a year for your wellness visit. We'll see you back sooner if needed after I review all those labs and those other studies. Do you have any other questions for me?
[patient]  No, document. I think you covered it all.
[doctor]  Great okay, the nurse will be back in a minute to give you MMR today, and the front desk will line up the time to do the shingles vaccine next month. Thanks Doc, have a great day alright. Use my general physical exam template. For a respiratory, notate perst lip breathing, low exhalation phase, clear to osculation, no weezing. Genitalia no-she-ate right testicle with 2 to 3 millimeters palpable nodule. Does not feel as if it will does not feel as if with the epidid amus or varicoseal left testicle normal no-hernia, all other portions of the physical exam, our normal default assessment history of aortic aneurysm repair the patient underwent an aortic valve replacement and ascending aortic aneurysm repair on January 20th. 2013 he is doing well overall and currently asymptomatic. He is currently not seen by cardiology, routinely suggested following up and suggested Vincent Sanchez at this physician. We will perform an echocardiogram slash stress test elevated alkaline phosphatase, level most recent CMP showed elevation at 156 this could be related to his liver, but most likely related to his bone health I have ordered an alkaline phosphatase, and again a GT lung field of normal finding on exoliciting on examination the patient has been noted to purses lips while breathing he was.

virtscribe,VS026,"[doctor]  Donna Torres, date of birth August 1, 1980. Hi, Donna, how are you?
[patient]  I'm good, how about you?
[doctor]  I'm doing well. Thank you. And so I saw that Dr. Brown put you on busspur. Have you been on that before?
[patient]  No, that's new.
[doctor]  Okay. How is it working for you?
[patient]  My anxiety is going good now. Thankfully, I'm serious. It was brutal in November and December. Finally, I was like I cannot do this. I have no idea why it happened. Dr. Ward did put me on singular. She did say, we need to be careful because singular can cause anxiety. So I'm not sure if that was the issue or what.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  And I would start usually during the day at work.
[doctor]  I see.
[patient]  I mean I'm fine now.
[doctor]  Well, that's good that things have settled. I do wonder if some of what you were dealing with is hormonal, and that's why I was asking because you were on the progesterone, and I feel like you were having some irritability back then, too.
[patient]  I did.
[doctor]  And that was before we started the progesterone.
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  So, I know he started for regulating your periods, but perhaps it helped with this also.
[patient]  Yeah, and before November and December, I noticed that the week before my period, my anxiety would go through the roof, which then I knew my period was coming. Then it turned into my anxiety spiking, just at random times.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  and it seemed like it was for no reason.
[doctor]  but November and December you were on the progesterone at that time.
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  Alright, so not really a link there, alright.
[patient]  Yeah, I don't know.
[doctor]  Yeah, I don't know either. Sometimes with the aging process, that can happen too.
[patient]  I figured maybe that's what it was.
[doctor]  And we did go through the go live in November and December, so that can be pretty stressful also.
[patient]  Yeah, and that worked. And that's when I first started to leave the process of delivering the results to patients with COVID in the beginning of the whole pandemic. Patients would have to wait nine days before they get their results. And then we opened the evaluation centers and the COVID clinic. So I think it just took a toll on me.
[doctor]  Yeah, I can absolutely see that.
[patient]  Yeah, and then I was feeling selfish because I wasn't even on the front lines. I mean, I was supporting people sure, but I wasn't in the ICU. So I felt selfish and guilty. I mean, hands down. The physicians and nurses were in the thick of it. And there I was having anxiety and it's not ridiculous.
[doctor]  Well, honestly you feel how you feel and what you were doing wasn't easy as well. So but let's see, I need to just put this DAX back to work. Alright, so no other issues whatsoever.
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Have you lost weight?
[patient]  No, when I stopped taking the Camilla birth control, my hunger level was at a new high. I mean, I was eating constantly. I felt like what was going on.
[doctor]  Alright.
[patient]  And now I'm feeling better.
[doctor]  Okay, that's good. And your mask face though, it does look thinner.
[patient]  Well, in the past six months, I have lost some weight.
[doctor]  Okay, good. Anything else going on?
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Alright, so your PAP was in 2019. I don't think that we need to repeat that because it was negative, negative. Have you ever had an abnormal PAP?
[patient]  Not with you, but I did around 2009 and then I had to be seen every six months for a while and then I had a normal path.
[doctor]  Alright, well let's just repeat it then.
[patient]  Yeah, that's fine with me to be safe.
[doctor]  Okay, I know it sounds superstitious, but I feel like with all the immunocompromising, the pressure, the stress that people's bodies have been under and the potential for getting COVID, or the vaccine, I have actually seen some an increase in abnormal paps and people who have been fine for a while, so that's why I figure let's just check.
[patient]  Okay, and I fight the vaccine fight every day at home because my husband isn't ready to get it. Same with my daughter. She shares the same worries as her dad and how it will impact her when she gets older.
[doctor]  Have you had the vaccine?
[patient]  Yes, I have and so has my son. He's had his first already.
[doctor]  Okay, well you know you can only do what you can do.
[patient]  Yeah, I agree.
[doctor]  Alright, well, let's complete your exam.
[patient]  Alright.
[doctor]  So let's take a deep breath and again, alright you can breathe normally.
[patient]  Alright, and take one more deep breath.
[doctor]  Okay, now I'm going to touch your neck. Go ahead and swallow. Perfect, and just place your hand above your head. Okay, I do feel some little bumps.
[patient]  Yeah, but they're not as big as they were.
[doctor]  Okay, in this breast it does feel a little bit denser. Does it hurt at all?
[patient]  It does where your left hand just was.
[doctor]  Okay, right here?
[patient]  Yeah, down here, but whenever I breastfed it was always or there too, I had a clog and something else. The lumps do feel smaller, but they're still there unfortunately.
[doctor]  Yeah, they are well now I don't know because if it was the progesterone, they would have gone away.
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  Alright, we'll just let your knees just relax and open. How's the itching or discomfort? Are you still using the cream?
[patient]  Yes, and I actually need to get that refill for the first time ever.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  But yeah, I use it once a week and it does help.
[doctor]  Okay, great. Alright, looks good.
[patient]  Good.
[doctor]  You can go ahead and sit up.
[patient]  Thank you.
[doctor]  All right, so typically the lumps would often just shrink up pretty quickly after you've had one or two cycles and you've had two cycles so far. So I think let's just keep monitoring them for now.
[patient]  Okay, and what could that mean?
[doctor]  Well, so just like people have an increased risk of breast cancer, there is also an increased risk for breast issues. You know what I mean? So for example, cysts and lumps and fibroadenomas. Those are all benign things. They are annoying and require some workup, but they are all benign.
[patient]  And I'm just worried because I'm almost full. 40 and my mom was almost 45 when she was diagnosed with breast cancer. So I mean, I know there is nothing I can do about it, but it's just I feel like we had it under control and now it isn't.
[doctor]  Well, I wouldn't say that. I mean, I feel like we're at a point where we have a good cadence for you having surveillance on things. And I think you're more aware of your breasts than ever before, and things actually haven't changed.
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  So those are all good things.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Because if it was cancer, it would actually we would see some change.
[patient]  It would okay. Thank you for explaining that.
[doctor]  Yeah, so I know it's annoying and distressing, but I think that's where we're at. It's annoying that you have the breast issue and it's annoying that we have to follow them.
[patient]  Yeah, I agree there.
[doctor]  But the only extra that I could potentially do is we could get a breast specialist on the team and have you start to follow with them. And one of the advantages there is that they sometimes will do an ultrasound as an extension of their physical exam in the office to check out, check it out on their own. They also have a lot more experience and more willingness to sometimes perform procedures earlier if they think it needs, if they think it needs to be done. And I think they tend to be much quicker than, you know, like radiology is to biopsy it.
[patient]  Okay, I'll do whatever you think I should.
[doctor]  All right. Well, I think since you're feeling worried, let's go ahead and we can get them on board. I'll send out a referral and they'll call you within the next couple of business days to schedule.
[patient]  Okay, I think that sounds great.
[doctor]  All right, I do too. All right, well, any questions or anything else we can discuss today?
[patient]  No, I think I'm all set.
[doctor]  All right, good. All right. We'll have a good rest of your day and just give us a call if you need anything else.
[patient]  Alright, thank you. You have a good day too.
[doctor]  Alright.","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Follow-up bilateral breast cysts.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Donna Torres is a 40-year-old female who presents for follow-up surveillance of bilateral breast cysts.

The patient reports continual presence of “lumps” in bilateral breasts with some soreness. She is being seen today for surveillance of the cysts. The patient is taking progesterone, which was initially prescribed to support normalization of menstruation, which was effective. She is also still using vaginal cream one time per week which has improved symptoms of itching and discomfort.

Her last pap smear was in 2019, with negative/negative results. She did have an abnormal pap smear in 2009, which resulted in repeat pap smears per 6 months until her results normalized.

Mrs. Torres experienced increased anxiety in 11/2021 and 12/2021, stating “it was brutal” and felt she could not manage her symptoms and sought treatment. Dr. Brown started the patient on Buspar, which has successfully controlled her anxiety. The patient relates her anxiety to work related stress and possibly aging. Her work involves supporting Covid evaluation centers and clinics. She confirms receiving both Covid vaccinations. Initially, she was experiencing spikes in anxiety prior to menstruation, but her anxiety then became more random with an unclear cause. To note, the patient was started on Singulair, which the patient was told could also cause anxiety.

The patient discontinued Camila birth control, which did result in a significant increase in appetite. This has resolved and she reports she has lost weight in the past 6 months.

virtscribe,VS027,"[doctor]  Sophia Brown, date of birth March 17th, 1946. This is a new patient visit. She is here to establish care for history of DCIS. We'll go over the history with the patient. Hello, Miss Brown.
[patient]  Hi, yes, that's me.
[doctor]  Wonderful. I'm Dr. Stewart. It's lovely to meet you. You as well. So you've come to see me today because you had a right breast lump pectomy last year, is that right?
[patient]  Yes, on January 20th, 2020.
[doctor]  Okay, and how you've been since then? Any problems or concerns? No, I'm feeling good. I do myself breast exams religiously now and haven't felt anything since. Perfect. I want to back up and go over your history. So I can make sure everything in your chart is correct and I don't miss anything. So I will tell you what we have in your chart from your other providers and you tell me if anything is wrong or missing sound good.
[patient]  Sound good.
[doctor]  Great, so I have that you were found to have a calcification in your right breast during a mammogram in October 2019. Was that just a normal screening mammogram or was it done because you felt a lump? It was just a normal one. You were supposed to get every so often. I see. And then it looks like you had an ultrasound of your right breast on November 3rd, 2019, which revealed a mass at the two o'clock position 11 centimeters from the nipple in the retroireolar region. The report states the mass was.
[patient]  0.4 by 2 by 3 centimeters.
[doctor]  Yes, that sounds right hard to remember now though.
[patient]  Yeah, definitely.
[doctor]  Based on those results, they decided to do an ultrasound guided core needle biopsy on December 5, 2019. Pathology results during that biopsy came back as grade 2 or positive PR positive DCIS.
[patient]  or ductal carcinoma in situ.
[doctor]  Yes, unfortunately, I know scary stuff, but you had a lump pectomy on January 20th, 2020, which removed the 8mm tumor and margins were negative.
[patient]  The pathology confirmed DCIS looks like they also removed five lymph nodes, which thankfully were negative from a legacy. That's great.
[doctor]  Yeah, I was definitely very relieved. And your last mammogram was in January 2021, and that was normal.
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  Okay, so I feel like I have a good grasp of what's been going on with you now, and you're here today to establish.
[patient]  Care with me so I can continue to follow you and make sure you're doing well, right?
[doctor]  Yes, fingers crossed.
[patient]  Definitely, we'll keep a close eye on you and take good care of you.
[doctor]  Okay, sounds good. I have a few more questions for you. When was your last colonoscopy? I had one in 2018, and if I remember correctly, I had one polyp and that was removed, and it wasn't cancerous.
[patient]  Okay, yes, I see that report now. One polyp in the sigmoid colon, which had a benign tubular angioma. Okay, and when was your last menstrual period?
[doctor]  Gosh, it was probably around 30 years ago.
[patient]  Okay, do you have children?
[doctor]  I do, I have five.
[patient]  Big family then, that's nice.
[doctor]  Yes, and they're all having kids in their own now, so it's getting even bigger.
[patient]  I bet sounds like fun.
[doctor]  It is. Did you have any other pregnancies that were miscarriages or terminations?
[patient]  Believe I did not.
[doctor]  Okay, so for the record that's G5, P5. And now that your postmenopausal, are you currently or have you ever been on hormone replacement therapy?
[patient]  My primary care doctor gave me the option years ago, but I decided against it.
[doctor]  Okay. And on your review of systems form, you indicated that you've not had any recent weight loss or gain, headaches, bone pain, urinary symptoms, or blood in the stools, but you did indicate that you have some back pain, joint pain, and high cholesterol. Tell me some more about those. Okay. So I've seen doctors for all of those. They said, excuse me, the back and knee pain are age-related, and the cholesterol is a fairly new diagnosis. But I am working on exercise and cutting back on fatty foods to see if I can get it lower without any medication. Okay. And your primary care doctor is following you for that, right?
[patient]  That's correct.
[doctor]  Okay, for medications, I have that you take Coke 10, vitamin D, vitamin C, fish oil, and elderberry fruit. Is that all right?
[patient]  Yes, and that's all.
[doctor]  Okay, so for your medical history, it's high cholesterol and stage zero are PR positive, invasive ductal carcinoma of the right breast. Any surgeries other than the lumpectomy?
[patient]  I did have my tubes tied after my last baby, but that's all.
[doctor]  Okay, and how about family history?
[patient]  My mom had non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and my dad had prostate cancer and heart disease, but I think that's it.
[doctor]  Alright, any family history of breast cancer?
[patient]  None.
[doctor]  Did any of your children have medical issues or siblings with medical problems? I do not have any siblings and thankfully my children are all healthy. Wonderful. Do you have any history of smoking, illicit drug use, heavy alcohol consumption?
[patient]  No drugs. I do drink socially but never more than that.
[doctor]  And I used to smoke, but really everybody did back then. And I probably quit about 30 years ago.
[patient]  Excellent. I have that you're allergic to penicillin. Any other allergies?
[doctor]  No, just penicillin. Okay, I think that covers it. Hop up here and let me take a look at you. Okay, so let's use the normal new patient exam template. Only change to make is the breast exam. There are no palpable masses, however, there is skin thickening at the medial inferior aspect of the right breast, which may be radiation, skin changes.
[patient]  In a Result section note that her ECOG performance status today is zero. Do you have, did you have radiation after the lmpectomy?
[doctor]  I did. We also talked about endocrin therapy, but I decided against that. Okay, so your exam looks good. No masses, just some skin changes from that radiation. Now, let's go over the plan for you.
[patient]  Okay, sounds good.
[doctor]  As you know you had DCIS, which will list in my note is Stage 0 or Slash PR positive invasive ductal carcinoma of the right breast. Your status post-lumpectomy with removal of five lymph nodes that were benign. You also had radiation therapy, but declined endocrine therapy. Today's clinical examination shows no evidence of recurrence with the DCIS or other malignancy.
[patient]  and your mammogram in January 2021 was also negative for recurrence of malignancy. So based on all of that, we can just continue to observe you.
[doctor]  Okay, that sounds great. And when do I come back into CU? In a year. But you should have another mammogram in April 2022 before you come back to see me.
[patient]  Okay, I can do that.
[doctor]  Wonderful. I'm glad to see you doing so well. Do you have any questions or concerns I can address for you today?
[patient]  I don't think so.
[doctor]  Okay great. My nurse will be in shortly to discharge you. Take care. You as well.","CHIEF COMPLAINT

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Sophia Brown is a 75 y.o. female who presents today for a new patient evaluation due to her history of right DCIS. She is doing well but wishes to establish care today for continued monitoring.

The patient underwent a screening mammogram in 10/2019 and was found to have a calcification in the right breast. She then had a right breast ultrasound on 11/03/2019 which revealed a mass at the 2 o’clock position, 11 cm from the nipple, in the retroareolar region. The report states the mass was 0.4 by 2.0 by 3.0 centimeters. She subsequently had an ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy on 12/05/2019 and pathology results revealed grade 2 ER-positive, PR-positive DCIS. The patient then had a lumpectomy with lymphadenectomy performed on 01/20/2020. The tumor was 8 mm with negative margins and the 5 lymph nodes removed were all benign. Pathology from the tumor confirmed DCIS. Her lumpectomy was followed by adjuvant radiation therapy. Endocrine therapy was also offered but the patient declined. She has since had a mammogram in 01/2021 which was normal. The patient also reports that she performs self-breast exams regularly at home.

Mrs. Brown is a G5P5 female and estimates that her last menstrual period was approximately 30 years ago. She is not currently and has never been on hormone replacement therapy.

The patient’s last colonoscopy was done in 2018. She had a sigmoid polypectomy at that time and pathology showed a tubular adenoma.

Her cholesterol was recently noted to be elevated and the patient reports that she is exercising and reducing fatty food intake accordingly. This is being followed by her primary care provider.

virtscribe,VS028,"[doctor]  Next patient is Sophia Jackson, MRNR 472348. She is a 57-year-old female who is here for a surgical consult.
[patient]  Her dermatologist referred her. She biopsied a 0.7 millimeters lesion, which was located on the right inferior back. Pathology came back as melanoma.
[doctor]  Mrs. Jackson, it's good to meet you.
[patient]  Likewise, wish you were under better circumstances.
[doctor]  Yeah, I heard your dermatologist sent you too because she found the melanoma.
[patient]  Yes, that's what the biopsy said.
[doctor]  Okay, and when did you first notice the spot?
[patient]  My mom noticed it when I was visiting her last month.
[doctor]  I see. And so you wanted the dermatologist on April 10th to get a checked out, right?
[patient]  Yes, I wanted to be extra cautious because skin cancer does run in my family.
[doctor]  Well, I'm really glad you took a serious and got a check. Who in your family has had skin cancer? And do you know if it was melanoma or was it basal cell or squamous cell?
[patient]  My mom and her sister, I think they both had melanoma.
[doctor]  Okay. Do you have any other types of cancer in the family like breast or ovarian?
[patient]  My grandfather had pancreatic cancer.
[doctor]  Okay, and what about your mom or dad's father?
[patient]  Mothers.
[doctor]  Okay, and have you personally had any skin spots in the past that you got checked out? And they were cancerous or precancerous?
[patient]  No, this was the first time I've been to dermatologist, but my primary care doctor looks over all of my moles every year. My physical and hasn't said he is concerned about any of them before.
[doctor]  Good good. Let's go over your medical history here in your chart. I have that you are not taking any medications and don't have any health problems listed, but that you are allergic to augmenting. Is that right?
[patient]  Yes, that's correct.
[doctor]  Okay, and for social history, can you tell me what you do for work?
[patient]  I own an auto repair shop. Okay, and have you ever been a smoker? Yeah, I still smoke from time to time. I started that awful habit in my teens, and it's hard to break, but I'm trying.
[doctor]  I'm glad you're trying to quit. What about your surgical history? Have you had any surgeries?
[patient]  I had gallbladder and appendix.
[doctor]  Okay, great. We can get your chart up to date now. Thank you. And other than the melanoma, how has your health been? Any unintentional weight changes? Headaches? Fatigue? Nausea? Vomiting vision changes?
[patient]  No, I've been feeling great.
[doctor]  Good. Well, let me take a look at your back here where they did the biopsy if you don't mind.
[patient]  Sure.
[doctor]  Okay, I'm going to describe it in medical jargon, what I'm seeing here so that the recording can capture it, but you and I are going to go over it together in just a moment, okay?
[patient]  Okay, that's fine.
[doctor]  Alright, so on the right inferior back, there is a 1 cm shave biopsy site including all of the dermis with no residual pigmentation, there is no intrinsic or satellite lesions. No other suspicious moles. No axillary, cervical or superclivicular lymphedenopathy. There is a soft lymph node in the right groin, but it's nontender. Otherwise normal exam.
[patient]  Okay, you can sit up. So what I was saying there is that I see your biopsy side, but I don't see any other skin lumps or bumps that looks as spacious.
[doctor]  I also felt your lymph nodes to see if any of them felt abnormal. There is one in the right groin that felt slightly abnormal. It's very likely nothing, but I do want you to have an ultrasound of that area to confirm it's nothing. And, you know, make sure it's something we need to worry about the reason we are being extra cautious, is that melanoma can very rarely metastasize to the lymph nodes. The ultrasound can tell us if we need to look into this further.
[patient]  Okay, I should have worried too much then.
[doctor]  No, I have a low suspicion that it will show anything.
[patient]  Okay, good.
[doctor]  So assuming that the ultrasound is normal, the treatment for your melanoma is to cut out the area where the lesion was, with lesions that are 0.7 millimeters or less, and that's what we recommend, and yours was exactly 0.7 millimeters. If it were any bigger, we would have had to do a more complex surgery, but what I recommend for you is what we call a wide local incision, excuse me, excision meaning that I will make a long incision, and then cut out an area a bit wider than your current biopsy site. The incision is long, because that's what allows me to close the skin nicely. You'll have a fairly long scar from the incision.
[patient]  Okay, that is fine with me. I can't see back there anyways.
[doctor]  Yeah, your wife can tell you what it looks like, and she may need to help care for the incision at it as it heals. But since we are doing the more complex surgery, I actually don't need to see you back unless you want to check in with me or have any problems, however, it is very important that you continue to follow up with your dermatologist regularly, so she can monitor you. Your dermatologist will check if this one doesn't come back, but she will also check for other lesions that look suspicious. Unfortunately, since you had one melanoma, you are at a higher risk of developing another one somewhere else.
[patient]  Yeah, she did say she wanted to see me back.
[doctor]  Good, and I'm sure she has already told you, but it's very important that you apply sunscreen anytime and anywhere that your skin is exposed to sunlight.
[patient]  Yeah, she definitely went over that several times with me.
[doctor]  Good. Other than that, I think that's all for me. We'll get you set up for the ultrasound and the procedure. Do you have any questions for me?
[patient]  No, I can't think of any at this time.
[doctor]  Okay, my nurse will be in to get you scheduled. So sit tight. It was very good to meet you.
[patient]  Thank you. Nice to meet you as well.
[doctor]  Please add the following pathology to results of pathology, shave of right inferior back, malignant melanoma, invasive superficial spreading, histology, superficial spreading. Clark level four, breast-loathe thickness 0.7 millimeters, radial growth phase present, vertical growth phase not identified, mitotic features less than 1 mm superscript 2, ulceration not identified, regression not identified.
[patient]  Lymphatic invasion not identified. Pairing neural invasion not identified. Microscopic satelliteosis not identified. Infiltrating lymphocytes, breast.
[doctor]  Melanocytic Nevis, not identified, predominant cytology, epithelioid, peripheral margin positive, deep margin negative, stage I. Also note that I reviewed the dermatologist photo of the lesion, which showed an asymmetric black and brown Nevis with central asmolinotic component and a regular border. For assessment and plan, the patient presents today with newly diagnosed melanoma. Biopsy revealed an intermediate thickness melanoma. On examination today, there is right inguinal lymph node with slightly atypical consistency.
[patient]  I recommended an ultrasound to rule out metastatic disease. If the ultrasound is normal, the patient is a candidate for wide local excision with a 1 to 2 centimeters margin. Primary closure should be possible, but skin graph closure may be needed. The relationship between tumor histology and prognosis and treatment was carefully reviewed. The need for follow-up according to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network Guidelines was reviewed. We also reviewed the principles of sun avoidance, skin self-examination, and the ABCDS of mullservalance. After discussing the procedure, risk and expected outcomes and possible complications, questions were answered, and the patient expressed understanding and did choose to proceed.","CHIEF COMPLAINT

virtscribe,VS029,"[doctor]  This is Philip Gutierrez date of birth January 12, 1971. He is a 50-year-old male here for a second opinion regarding the index finger on the right hand.
[patient]  He had a hyper-extension injury of that index finger during a motor vehicle accident in March of this year. He was offered an injection of the A1 pulley region, but did not want any steroid because of the reaction to Dexamethasone, which causes his heart to race.
[doctor]  He was scheduled to see Dr. Alice Davis, which it doesn't appear he did. He had an MRI of that finger because there was concern about a capsular strain plus or minus rupture of FDS tendon end.
[patient]  He has been seen at point May orthopedics largely by the physical therapy staff and a PR pod that institution at that practice. An MRI was obtained on April 24th, 2021.
[doctor]  which showed just focal soft tissue swelling over the right index in CP joint partial thickness tear of the right FDS and fluid consistent with tenosinovitis around the FDP and FDS tendons. Radial and ulnar collateral ligaments of the index in CP joint were intact as the MCP joint capsule. Extensor tendons also deemed intact. His X-rays for views of the right hand today show no bony abnormalities. Joint congruency throughout all lesser digits on the right hand. No soft tissue shadows of concern. No arthritis. Hi, how are you, Mr? Gudieras? I'm good how about you?
[patient]  Well, how can I help you today? So I was a passenger in a car that was rear-ended, and we were hit multiple times. I felt two bumps which slugged me forward and caused me to stretch out my right index finger.
[doctor]  So hitting the car in front of you all made that finger go backwards.
[patient]  I don't really know. I just felt like it felt like I laid on my finger. And so I felt like it went back and it's been hurting since about March. And it's been like that ever, ever since the wreck happened. So I can't make a fist, but sometimes the pain is unbearable and like even driving hurts.
[doctor]  Okay, so this was March of this year. So maybe about three months ago?
[patient]  Yeah, and it's still swollen. So I was seeing an orthopedist and they sent me to an occupational therapist and I've been doing therapy with them and then they sent me to go back and get an MRI. So I went and got the MRI. Then they told me that the MRI came back and I said I had a tear in my finger, but he wasn't going to give me an injection because the injection was going to make the tear worse.
[doctor]  knock I know
[patient]  And then after he got the MRI, he said that I have a tear in my finger and that he didn't want to do surgery, but he would do an injection. Then I'm thinking that you told me you wouldn't do an injection in there. And then the occupational therapy says it's because of the tear and then they don't want me to keep rubbing the thing and doing things with my hand. So I feel like I'm not getting medical care really.
[doctor]  틈리아 아이스이다
[patient]  So I came to see if you could do anything for this hand because I am right-handed and I kind of need that hand.
[doctor]  And then what do you do for a living?
[patient]  I'm an X-ray tech.
[doctor]  Well, so do you have any diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis?
[patient]  Nope. Do you take any chronic medications of significance?
[doctor]  I do take a blood pressure pill and that's it.
[patient]  Okay, and it looks like you suffer from itching with the methyl prednisone.
[doctor]  That's correct. Alright, well, I'm going to scoot up closer and just take a quick look at your hand. Alright, so lean over here. Alright, so on this exam today, we have a very pleasant, cooperative, healthy male no distress. His heart rate is regular rate, rhythm, two plus radial pulse. No swelling or bruise, bruising in the palm over the volar surface of his index finger. Normal creases slightly diminished over the tip of the index finger, compared to the middle finger.
[patient]  His index finger rest in a 10 degree pit flex position. All right. Is that uncomfortable to correct that? And is it uncomfortable now here?
[doctor]  Yeah, when you push on it, yeah.
[patient]  Alright, how about here? There it's not.
[doctor]  Okay, not as bad.
[patient]  Yeah, it feels well known.
[doctor]  Gotcha, all right. Bend, bend the tip of this finger. Bend it as hard as you can keep bending, keep bending. All right, straighten it out.
[patient]  Alright, and now bend it for me as best you can. My goodness, feels like it's tearing in there. Okay, okay. Well, bend the tip of this finger and bend it as hard as you can. Keep bending. Alright, straighten that out, and now bend it for me as best as you can.
[doctor]  All right, good. Now bend that finger, and I'm gonna pull, put it down like this, and then bend that finger for me. Okay, sorry, can you bend it for me? All right, now make a fist, great. So relax the finger. All right, so just keep it, keep when I bend the finger. We're just gonna bend that finger where it meets the hand. Is that okay there?
[patient]  Power
[doctor]  Okay, okay, so all the hurt it seems is stretching because you haven't been doing this for so long, so you know what I mean so you're gonna have to start really doing that.
[patient]  Well, I've tried. I even bought myself a split.
[doctor]  Well, but a splint doesn't help move you. It actually immobilizes you.
[patient]  Okay, I thought it would strain it out.
[doctor]  No, no, so you really need to start bending the finger right here for me as hard as you can and keep going going. All right, so you're okay. All right, so I would say the following that there is a partial tear in one of the two flexor tendons. There is the FDP and the FDS and the FDS is the least important of the two. So the MRI shows that it's the FDS, the flexor digitorum, superficialis, which is the least important of the two.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Now there are two halves of it, so it's the partial tear of one half of a whole tendon. That's not that important, and the other one is just fine. So the good one is good.
[patient]  Yes, correct. So the one that goes all the way to the tip is good.
[doctor]  Okay, good.
[patient]  Yeah, so you know, I think what you have got so much scar tissue and inflammation around the FDS tendon.
[doctor]  blocking excursion of these other tendons that they can't get through to the pulley.
[patient]  Okay. Alright.
[doctor]  So what I would recommend, what we try is a cortisone injection, and I would avoid the dexamethasone because I saw you have a little reaction to that. But we could use the beta-methasone, which is a cellostone I've gotten another methyl prednisolone, and that itching like crazy.
[patient]  Did it? Yeah. This one is water soluble and I think it's fairly low toxicity, but high benefit and I think decreasing the pain will encourage you to move that finger.
[doctor]  Alright, we'll give it a try. Good. So you do the shot and it's going to take about three to five days before it starts feeling better and then probably over the next couple of weeks. It'll start feeling even better.
[patient]  Perfect.
[doctor]  Alright, so take advantage of that. You got to start moving the finger. You're not going to tear anything or break a bone because your intensers, extensors are intact. But your collateral ligaments are intact, so you got to sore finger. I'm going to try to help as much as I can with the soreness part, and then you have to do all the stiff part.
[patient]  The lady in occupational therapy tried some maneuvers to straighten the finger out, but it even hurt after I left. The whole thing just swelled up.
[doctor]  Okay, so it was injured and you had scar tissue and then you had post-traumatic inflammation and so this will help some with all of that. It's not gonna make it to where your finger is like my finger doesn't hurt at all, but it will make it to where at least tolerable to where you can make some gains and we actually might need to repeat this as well.
[patient]  We'll be able to drive. I drove myself here today, so...
[doctor]  Yeah, it may feel a little weird, but it's totally safe for you to drive. Okay, good.
[patient]  So from Mr. Gutierrez just put that he has a post-traumatic rather severe stenosing tenosanovitis of his right index finger.
[doctor]  And the plan is steroid injection today. Do a trigger injection, but I'm using a CC of beta-methasone. So, Mr. Gutiaras, do you have therapy scheduled or set up?
[patient]  Not the moment.
[doctor]  Alright, well, I mean you know that you need to move that finger, and I think to the degree that they can help you do that. So, I want you to move that finger finger, but I think it would be beneficial for you to have an accountability.
[patient]  So at least you know to check in with them once a week with somebody.
[doctor]  Okay, that's kinda why I'm here for you. Tell me what needs to be done, you know.
[patient]  Yeah, so I'll write you out.
[doctor]  and outpatient prescription. I think if you go back to the same people where you were before, I'm hoping that after this injection, you're going to be able to do a whole lot more with them. So let's do outpatient once a week for six weeks.
[patient]  and then full active and passive range of motion is the goal with no restrictions.
[doctor]  Alright sounds like a plan.
[patient]  All right, while I will have a nurse set up the injection procedure in wheel and I'll be back shortly.
[doctor]  Thanks document. Right, trigger finger injection template. Attended to inject one cubic centimeter of cellistone with half a CC of lidocaine, however, the patient had a dramatic and violent painful reaction to the introduction of the needle with contortions of the hand and with dangerously withdrawing the hand with concerns for secondary needle stick. Needle was withdrawn. The patient was counseled as to the importance of attempting to get some therapeutic steroid in the flexor tendon sheath. We attended a second time for a similar injection using the same technique with one cubic centimeter of cellistone and half a CC of lidocaine.
[patient]  A small Palmer Vane bled a scan amount, which was cleaned up and bandaid applied. Reassured on multiple occasions that no harm was done to his finger, recommended icing and at this evening and taking ibuprofen.","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Right index finger hyperextension injury.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Ms. Philip Gutierrez is a pleasant 50-year-old right-hand-dominant male here today for a 2nd opinion regarding evaluation of the right index finger hyperextension injury sustained during a motor vehicle accident in 03/2021.

In summary, the patient was the passenger in a vehicle that was rear-ended. He reports they were hit multiple times as he felt 2 bumps which caused his to sling forward hyperextending his right index finger. He was offered an injection of the A1 pulley region, but he did not want any steroid due to a reaction to dexamethasone that causes his heart to race. The patient was scheduled to see Dr. Alice Davis, but he has not seen his yet. The patient has been seen at Point May Orthopedics, by the physical therapy staff and a physician assistant at that practice. He underwent an MRI of the right index finger because they were concerned about a capsular strain plus or minus a rupture of the ""FDS tendon.""

The patient states that he is unable to make a fist secondary to pain and swelling in the right index finger. He describes a pulling, tearing sensation in the right index finger. The pain is exacerbated by driving. He notes that he has been wearing a right index finger splint.

The patient denies any history of diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis. He reports only taking medication for hypertension and denies taking any other chronic medications of significance. He also notes methylprednisolone causes his to itch.

Ms. Gutierrez is employed as an x-ray technician.

PAST HISTORY

Medical
Hypertension.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Employed as x-ray technician.

ALLERGIES

Methylprednisolone causes itching.
Dexamethasone causes palpitations.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

• Musculoskeletal: Right index finger pain.
• Endocrine: Denies diabetes.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Constitutional
Very pleasant, healthy appearing, cooperative male in no distress.

Neurological
Grossly intact. Slightly diminished sensation to light touch over the right PIP joint of the index finger compared to the middle finger.

Cardiovascular
Regular rate and rhythm.

Musculoskeletal
Exam of the right hand, there is no swelling or ecchymosis in the palm on the volar surface of his index finger. Normal creases are noted. Index finger rests in a 10 degree PIP joint flexed position with discomfort upon correction. Bilateral extremities 2+ radial pulses.

RESULTS

X-rays today, 4 views of the right hand, show no bony abnormalities. Joint congruency throughout all lesser digits on the right hand. No soft tissue shadows of concern. No arthritis.

MRI of the right index finger performed on 04/24/2021. Independent review of the images shows focal soft tissue swelling over the right index MCP joint, partial-thickness tear of the right FDS, and fluid consistent with tenosynovitis around the FDP and FDS tendons. Radial and ulnar collateral ligaments of the index MCP joint were intact as was the MCP joint capsule. The extensor tendons were also deemed intact.

ASSESSMENT

• Stenosing tenosynovitis of right index finger.

Ms. Philip Gutierrez is a pleasant 50-year-old right-hand-dominant male here today for a 2nd opinion of his right index finger hyperextension injury sustained during a motor vehicle accident in March of this year. The findings of his examination are consistent with rather severe post-traumatic stenosing tenosynovitis.

PLAN

The patient and I had a lengthy discussion regarding his history, symptoms, and radiographic findings. We discussed the pathophysiology and natural history of stenosing tenosynovitis and the anatomy of the flexor tendons and pulley system in the hand. I explained to the patient that the flexor digitorum superficialis tendon was clearly intact and that He is suffering from post-traumatic inflammation around the flexor digitorum superficialis tendon blocking excursion of the flexor tendons to the A1 pulley.

Treatment options were discussed including conservative management with corticosteroid injections and their statistical effectiveness. Surgical correction was also briefly discussed, although I recommend exhausting non-operative measures with a minimum of 2 injections before proceeding with surgery. I recommended a right index trigger finger cortisone injection today, and the patient elected to proceed. I also recommend that the patient report to occupational therapy once a week for the next 6 weeks to work on full active and passive right index finger range of motion with no restrictions.

The patient verbalizes understanding with the treatment plan and agrees. All questions were answered to the patient's satisfaction today.

PROCEDURE

Right index trigger finger injection.
The patient understands the risks and benefits and elected to proceed, signed consent obtained. An attempt was made to inject 1.0 cc of Celestone with 0.5 cc of lidocaine. However, the patient had a dramatic and violent painful reaction to the introduction of the needle with contortions of the hand and with dangerously withdrawing the hand with concerns for secondary needle stick. Therefore, the needle was withdrawn. The patient was counseled as to the importance of attempting to get some therapeutic steroid in the flexor tendon sheath. We attempted a 2nd time for a similar injection using the same technique with 1.0 cc of Celestone and 0.5 cc of lidocaine. There was a small palmar vein that bled a scant amount, which was cleaned up off the back of the patient's hand. A Band-Aid was applied. He was reassured on multiple occasions that no harm was done to his finger. I recommended icing it this evening and taking ibuprofen.

INSTRUCTIONS

Occupational therapy as prescribed.

[patient]  You're welcome. So what I think we're dealing with is right hip degenerative joint disease.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  And we do have some options. So first is to start some low impact exercises. I can provide you with a handout with what exercises you can do. You should take NSIDS as needed to help with the pain and discomfort, as well as use of a cane to help offload the right side. A cane will help support your painful side to help reduce the pain.
[doctor]  I don't love that idea, but I will give it a try.
[patient]  Okay, that would be great. And we can also try a Corteson injection into the right hip joint to see if that offers any relief.
[doctor]  I would like to definitely get that injection.
[patient]  Okay, we can take care of that today while you are here and then schedule a follow-up appointment in three months to see how you are doing and then receive another injection if needed.
[doctor]  Okay, that sounds good.
[patient]  Okay, and here are the risks associated with getting the injection. Please, just take a moment to review it and consent to the shot.
[doctor]  I'm good.
[patient]  Great, we'll get that set up for you. Alright, well I hope things feel better and we will see you back here in three months.

[doctor]  Deep tendon reflexes, one plus throughout. No focal motor weakness is noted. No focal sensory deficit noted. Can you please include the surgical list?
[patient]  Next radiographs, Mr. Arthurogram of the right hip, Dunn, June 3rd, 2021 show high grade Condromalacia involving the Antarose Superior right acetabulum with sub-condromarodema and cis formation. Plan options include low impact exercise program, use of an end-set, and use of the cane to offload the right. We discussed that she'd like to proceed with a cortisone injection in right hip joint. I explained the risks of injection, including needles, sterile, and COVID. She understood and decided to proceed with the injection.
[doctor]  She will follow up with me in three months for another injection if needed. End of dictation.","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Right hip pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Elizabeth Reyes is a 56-year-old female who presents for the evaluation of pain in her right hip and groin region. Her symptoms started on 02/2020 and has progressively worsened. She is employed as an RN and notes that her symptoms began while she was working and walking around the infusion room at Johnson. Initially the pain would only happen when she took a step back, but the pain has progressed and now occurs with any type of movement involving her right hip and groin.

virtscribe,VS032,"[doctor]  Dictating on Donald Clark date of birth March 4th, 1937, Chief Complaint is Left Arm Pain. Hello, how are you?
[patient]  Good morning.
[doctor]  It's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Miller.
[patient]  It's nice to meet you as well.
[doctor]  So, I hear you were having pain in this arm. Is that correct?
[patient]  That's correct.
[doctor]  Okay, and it seems like it's worse at night.
[patient]  Right now the hand is.
[doctor]  okay
[patient]  And the thing started about two weeks ago, I woke up about two o'clock in the morning and it was just hurting something awful.
[doctor]  AHH
[patient]  And then I laid some ice on it and it finally did ease up.
[doctor]  Okay, that's good.
[patient]  So I got up, I sat on the side of the bed and held my arm down, thinking it would like help the circulation, but it didn't.
[doctor]  Okay, I see.
[patient]  And so after a while, when it eased off maybe about 4 or 5am, I laid back down and it didn't start up again.
[doctor]  Yeah, I'm blabbed.
[patient]  I went back to sleep, but for several nights this happened like over and over. So I finally want to see the doctor and I don't really recall her name.
[doctor]  Okay. Yeah, I think I know who you're talking about though.
[patient]  She is the one who sent me to you. So I would think so. But when I went to her after the third time happened, then she checked me out. She said it was most likely coming from a pinch nerve.
[doctor]  Probably do notice that moving your neck or turning your head seems to bother your arm.
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Okay. Is moving your shoulder uncomfortable at all?
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  And do you notice it at other times besides during the night?
[patient]  Some days, if it bothers me at night, then the day following it usually will bother me some.
[doctor]  Okay, and do you just notice it in the hand or does it seem to be going down the whole arm?
[patient]  Well it starts there and goes all the way down the arm.
[doctor]  Okay. Have you noticed any weakness in your hand at all?
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  Kay, like in terms of gripping things?
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  This finger I heard it sometime ago as well.
[doctor]  Really?
[patient]  Yeah, it doesn't work properly or it works very rarely.
[doctor]  Gacha, and did I hear that she gave you some prednisone and some oral steroids or?
[patient]  While she gave me some numbing medicine, it helped a little bit. The other two were in neck pill and gabapin.
[doctor]  You should have a full list in your notes though since then it hasn't really bothered me at night. Also, just see now I am a VA and him 1% disabled from this leg issues from the knees down to my feet okay. Is it neuropathy? Gacha, that is good to know. All right, well let's go ahead and take a look.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Alright, so to start, I'm gonna have you do something for me. Just go ahead and tilt your chin as far as you can down to your chest. Okay, good. And now go the other way. Tilting your chin up as far as you can. Now does that seem to bother you at all? Okay, and now come back to normal. Just look and turn your head as far as you can that way, great. And now as far as you contoured that wall, does not seem to bother you at all now. Well, actually I do feel a little strain, okay? So you feel it in the neck a little bit yet as a little strain. Okay, now squeeze my fingers as hard as you can with both hands. Great, now hold your arms like this.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  And I'm going to try to straighten your arms and try and keep them as stiff as you can. Don't let me straighten it. Okay, good, good. Now, when I am just touching your hands like this, does it seem to feel about the same in both hands?
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  Okay, all right, so I do agree with Betty more than likely. This seems like it would be coming from your neck. That's the most common reason that causes what you're experiencing. And I looked at an x-ray of your neck and you do seem to have a lot of arthritis there and there does seem to be potential for a disc to be pushing on a nerve. And now what I don't have is an MRI which would show me kind of exactly where the nerve roots are getting pinched off.
[patient]  I see.
[doctor]  So, gabapenin can help a little bit with the nerve pain, and what I would like to do is potentially set you up for an epidural. And what that is, is it's a focused anti-inflammatory medicine excuse me that works behind the nerve roots. That nerve roots that we are thinking might be getting squished off. It can often help alleviate your symptoms, and I do need to get an MRI of your neck. I know we have had one of your lower back, but I need one of your neck to see exactly where the roots are getting pinched off. So what I can do is tentatively set you up for an epidural, but before you do that, we do need to get that MRI so I can see. Right where I need to put the medicine for your epidural. What do you think of that?
[patient]  I think that sounds good to me.
[doctor]  Okay, good, and just to confirm, do you take any blood thinners? I don't think I saw any on your medicine list.
[patient]  No, I don't.
[doctor]  Okay, good. And what I would have you do is continue with the GABA pen and are you taking 300 or 100?
[patient]  I'm not sure my lady friend helped me handle this stuff.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  I'm taking a liquid cell.
[doctor]  Okay, so whatever you are doing, you can just keep doing it and I'm going to set you up for the epidural and imaging study just so I know right up with the medicine and I will follow up with you after that and we can do the shot just to make sure your arm is feeling better sound good.
[patient]  Sounds good. For the last couple of nights though my neck has not been bothering me.
[doctor]  Okay, so presumably what's happening then is when you're sleeping your neck is kind of gets off tilt-tilter and it compresses the nerve roots there. Now, if you think you're doing fine, we could hold off, but at the very least, I'd like to update that MRI of yours and see what's going on because probably this is something that will likely flare up again.
[patient]  Yet it has been for the last week, so I understand. Okay, all right, well, do you want to do that work up and do the epidural? Or do you think you're doing fine and do you want to wait? Well, my hand is still bothering me. Okay, so you're saying your neck is not bothering you, but the hand is. Okay, so then let's just stick with the plan.
[doctor]  and arrive the neck so we can see where the nerve roots may be compressed that's giving your hand the issue and then we're going to set you up with the epidural.
[patient]  Okay, sounds good.
[doctor]  Alright, so keep going with the Gabba Penton. I will order the imaging of your neck, and the shot will hopefully help some with those symptoms in your hand, and then we will follow up afterwards.
[patient]  Alright, is the MRI today?
[doctor]  You probably can't do it today, but let me talk with Roy and see how soon we can get it done. Just give me a quick minute and then Roy will come in and get things scheduled as soon as we can. Alright.

Left arm pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

He reports that his left arm pain began approximately 2 weeks ago. He woke around 2:00 am with intense pain in his left arm and hand. He applied ice and after 2-3 hours, the pain improved and he was able to go back to sleep, the pain did not return until that evening. After several nights of experiencing the left arm and hand pain, he was seen by Betty Ross, PA-C. She suspected a pinched nerve and completed x-rays of the cervical spine, prescribed gabapentin and prednisone, and referred the patient to us. The patient has benefited from the gabapentin and prednisone, reporting improvement of pain at night.

The pain initially was encountered at night, but the patient notes that the symptoms carry into the next day. He denies pain when moving his neck, turning his head, and moving his shoulder.

[patient]  I've been doing good.
[doctor]  Great how about your breast today, doing alright? Great are you having any chills fever nausea or vomiting now good peak real quick sure how's life? Otherwise pretty good nothing new just enjoying summertime okay? How's your family?
[patient]  Very good.
[doctor]  Good alright, I'm gonna take a look at your breasts now. If you would just open up your gown for me, everything looks good, has her back pain. I'm not really having any more any hard spots lumps, or bumps that you've noticed I did when I came in last time when I saw your parruth santa's in March. She said, I she said she found a lump right here under my left breast, but I haven't felt it since then. But I did the massage's echo that that is good is probably. Just a scar tissue, but everything looks good. And you're healing wonderful. So I told her that the scar here was kind of bothering me, and I got for gel. I was using it every day, but I don't think I needed now. Yeah, that scar did widen a little bit. Let me take a closer look. Hang on. This one widened a little too. Your incisions are well healed though with no signs of infection or any redness on either breast. So I'm not concerned. But this one just bothered me a little bit more understanding culture gown. Now the only thing that is really going to help out that is to to cut it out and reclose it.
[doctor]  And you don't want that uh?
[patient]  I mean, not right now.
[doctor]  You want to come back and revisit maybe six months yet elliptal that I still have and I still have some more of the gel and I can try using that again, okay? Keep doing that twice a day. The gel is going to lighten the color a little bit, which is already pretty light, but just in that area and it's its high tension, so it's going to rub a little bit.
[patient]  Yeah, but it kind of bothers me a little bit.
[doctor]  I do see that like I said the only way to really fix that is to cut it out with a six months and then we'll go from their semi-a plan but we haven't had a full year yet I know I wouldn't do any revisions anyway for scar tissue until we're at least a year out anyway.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  So let's wait those six months. You can keep using the MetaMascar Gel twice a day. Massage and Scar Gel will help with the scars. You can put it on other scars too if you need.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  So that's what I would do. Let's just get some pictures today so we can keep up with them and keep an eye on the scars and then we will go from there.
[patient]  Sound good.
[doctor]  Alright, well it's good to see you. I'm glad you're doing well.
[patient]  Yeah, same here.
[doctor]  Alright, well I'm going to tell the front desk six months and we'll revisit those scars.
[patient]  Alright.
[doctor]  Thank you. I'm going to come and get your photos now, okay?

virtscribe,VS039,"[doctor]  Next patient is Paul. Date of birth is January 15th, 1962. This is a 59-year-old HIV positive gentleman here for hypogonatism. Patient was last seen on November 24th, 2020. He is.
[patient]  His notable things are number one. He is on one milliliter every 10 days. His levels were less than 300 to begin with. He is on finasteride currently. He also takes psialis daily. So he takes all his pills just for me. Patients other area of concern is gynecomastia, which we will discuss with him today. His last PSA was 0.66, and his last testosterone was greater than 1,500.
[doctor]  Hey, how are you today?
[patient]  Alright, how you been?
[doctor]  I'm good.
[patient]  Good good
[doctor]  Have you lost some weight or are you at least putting on some muscle? You look trump.
[patient]  No, I think I'm pretty much the same as I've always been.
[doctor]  Really? Okay, maybe it's just your black shirt. Make sure you look them.
[patient]  Yeah, I guess that's it.
[doctor]  So, health wise, how is everything going?
[patient]  Good, the testosterone is going well.
[doctor]  That's great.
[patient]  Help me out, I feel good, more vigorous, sleeping well, and I think it's having some positive effects. Not so much physically because like I said, I've been this way my whole life, but I'm seeing some good improvement to my blood work.
[doctor]  Okay, well, that's good.
[patient]  So the finasteride, I'm only taking half a pill, it's the 5 milligrams one.
[doctor]  Yeah, I remember you telling me that.
[patient]  In psialis on the days I work out, I take 5 milligrams, otherwise I take 2 and a half milligrams pills, but I have been out of it.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  But overall, I'm doing well. I'm actually taking the correct steps to get my life together.
[doctor]  Good. It's always great to hear. Let's look I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Please use my general exam template. Alright, just take a few breaths.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Now. Alright, everything sounds good. No concerns there.
[patient]  Great, so I wanted to show you something.
[doctor]  Sure.
[patient]  Look at this.
[doctor]  Okay, this is your cholesterol.
[patient]  Yeah, my cholesterol and triglycerides, I used to have high triglycerides, you see there were 265 milligrams per DL, then I took my first dose of the testosterone on the 28th.
[doctor]  Right.
[patient]  Now, five months later, look at my numbers.
[doctor]  Wow, that's remarkable.
[patient]  This is the test, it's the only change. I don't know, I haven't honestly seen many guys over the years that have cholesterol problems, and this I mean there's a big correlation between diabetic control and testosterone replacement, meaning those who get good levels of their test see their diabetic control improve.
[doctor]  Yeah, but I haven't seen a lot of data on the impact on cholesterol. Regardless, we will take it.
[patient]  I agree. I was very impressed with my triglycerides and was just wondering if the test maybe was helping.
[doctor]  Yeah, that's an unbelievable difference.
[patient]  145 milligrams per DL from 265 milligrams per DL is awesome. I also read that it's cardio protective.
[doctor]  Absolutely.
[patient]  My red blood cell count has increased.
[doctor]  Yeah, I saw that. It's fine though.
[patient]  stable
[doctor]  Your PSA at today is also is good also. It's 0.6 I think.
[patient]  Yeah?
[doctor]  Yeah, it was 0.5 last year and anything under 4 is good.
[patient]  Nice, such good news.
[doctor]  So, it just needs to be checked every year or so.
[patient]  So in terms of estrogen control, I've been hearing that in doll 3 carbonyl or broccoli extract, supposedly can improve my estrogen levels. Have you ever heard of it? Yeah, I've heard of it, but I haven't had anybody consistently use it. I mean your levels are fine and we checked your estrogen eye all, and it was not elevated, so. Okay.
[doctor]  I would argue that we could test that in the fall if you want, but we don't need to do any more tests, any more than tests once a year. Excuse me.
[patient]  Okay, what about increasing my testosterone to 175 milligrams? I'm at 140 now.
[doctor]  Well, your levels are high.
[patient]  Are they right now?
[doctor]  Well, I mean they were last time.
[patient]  Yeah, but I just injected though where I had right before that was taken.
[doctor]  I know, I know you had then. When did you inject this time?
[patient]  I figure I'm on my eighth day today.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  So I'm due to dose on Thursday or Friday.
[doctor]  Alright.
[patient]  I have a little med calendar and I put checks and tees on it that helps me.
[doctor]  That's a great idea. So look the biggest issue I've seen even if your levels today are around 700, is that your peaks are getting greater than 1500, putting you at a higher chance of needing to come off due to blood thickness, and your risk will only go up the higher the dose that we go on.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  You look well, your levels are good, and you are feeling well.
[patient]  Yeah, I'm feeling good.
[doctor]  I'm going to be blunt. Unfortunately, this happens often where you are feeling good, but you want to feel really good. I mean, I get it. And this is why people get into problems with this stuff, right? It's like back in the day when it wasn't prescribed by doctors and people would get it at gyms and stuff, and they would take huge doses, and then they would have a heart attack at 50.
[patient]  Yeah, they have to be taking a lot.
[doctor]  likely they are taking more than testosterone, but still.
[patient]  and they're taking stuff for a long time.
[doctor]  True, but right now I would not change your dose.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Make sense?
[patient]  It does, I appreciate the discussion.
[doctor]  No problem. What pharmacy are you using? Have you changed it or anything?
[patient]  No changes, I use Walmart Pharmacy. I don't need more psialis and finasteride.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  I would prefer the paper prescription.
[doctor]  for all of them.
[patient]  Sure.
[doctor]  Alright, we will do. Let me go get your prescriptions.
[patient]  Okay, thank you.","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Hypogonadism.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Mr. Paul Edwards is a 59-year-old male, an established patient, who presents to the clinic today for hypogonadism. He was last seen on 11/24/2020. The patient’s history includes positive for HIV, and today he is concerned with gynecomastia.

The patient is doing well, overall, and feels the testosterone is helping. He reports weight stability, feels lively, good, more vigorous, and he is sleeping well. He also thinks the testosterone is having a positive effect on his blood work. He endorses that his triglycerides have always been elevated and adds that they were as high as 265 mg/dL. The patient presented a copy of his bloodwork, showing a significant decrease in his cholesterol after 5 months. Mr. Edwards questioned if the changes in his blood work were due to the testosterone. He also noted that his red blood cell count has not increased. The patient inquired about possible benefits of Indole-3-carbinol, which is a broccoli extract for estrogen control.

Currently, the patient is dosing 140 ng/dL of testosterone per week and inquired if his dose could be increased to 175 ng/dL. He recalled that he had recently injected testosterone before his last testosterone blood work was performed; last testosterone levels were greater than 1500 ng/dL. The patient confirms continued daily use of Finasteride and Cialis, prescribed by me, and stated he needs a refill for both.

Mr. Edwards mentioned he is taking correct steps to get his life ""together."" He also uses a med calendar to help with medication compliance.

PAST HISTORY

Medical
HIV

SOCIAL HISTORY

Utilizes med calendar to support medication compliance.
Actively trying to get his life together.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

Cialis 5 mg tablet by mouth on days he exercises, 2.5 mg tablet by mouth on days without exercise.
Finasteride 5 mg half tablet daily.
Testosterone cypionate 140 mg.

RESULTS

PSA 0.6 ng/mL.
Triglycerides 145 mg/dL.
Total testosterone 1500 ng/dL, 11/24/2021.

ASSESSMENT

• Hypogonadism.

PLAN

I recommend maintaining current management. The patient’s last testosterone levels were greater than 1500 ng/dL, although this level was likely related to his recent injection. He requested an increase to his testosterone cypionate from 140 mg to 175 mg, which I denied due to his already high testosterone levels. I counseled the patient on the risks associated with high testosterone levels and Indole-3-carbinol and it’s lacking evidence to support his estrogen levels. The last time his estradiol levels were checked, they were normal; recommend annual screening.

I provided paper prescription refills for Cialis and Finasteride.
