virtassist,D2N168,"[doctor]  Hi, Diane, how are you?
[patient]  I'm doing okay, how are you?
[doctor]  I'm doing okay. So I know the nurse told you about DAX and I'd like to tell DAX a little bit about you okay?
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Diane is a 28-year-old female with a past medical history, significant for depression and hypertension who presents for emergency room follow-up.
[doctor]  So, Diane, what's going on? I heard that your blood pressure was really high in the emergency room. What happened?
[patient]  Yeah, so I ended up going for a walk yesterday because it was sunny and it was really great. And I just felt really light headed and I started to fall a bit and luckily I was with my boyfriend and he caught me and then we went right to the E to the ear.
[doctor]  Yeah, okay. Yeah, I saw that the blood pressure was pretty high, like in like the almost 200.
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  Did you have a headache?
[patient]  Yeah, I did.
[doctor]  Okay, all right. Have your blood pressures been running high in the past?
[patient]  Yeah, they have been. It's like once a week a month, it kind of just skyrockets.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  It usually ends up being I'm traveling a lot that week for work so I'm not eating as well.
[doctor]  You're not taking your blood pressures, I take it.
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  When you're traveling
[patient]  Yeah, no, I don't bring my cuff with me.
[doctor]  Okay, but you did buy the cuff like we talked about in the past.
[patient]  Yes, I did.
[doctor]  Okay, all right. And are you taking your medication? Are you taking the lysinopril?
[patient]  Yes, I am.
[doctor]  Okay, all right. So I think we had started you at a kind of a moderate dose. So we'll have to talk about that a little bit. Okay.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Then in terms of your depression, how are you doing? I know that we didn't start you on medication since you're on a bunch of other medications. What? What are your strategies for dealing with that? And how are you doing?
[patient]  So last year I started therapy and I've been going once a week and that's really helped.
[doctor]  Okay, all right, great. And how is your support system?
[patient]  Really great. My boyfriend, my mom, and my brother are, are S amazing and they're all super close to me. So it's been, it's been good.
[doctor]  Okay, well great. So I know you did a review of system sheet when you checked in, and I know that you had the headache and the lightheadedness yesterday. Do you have any other symptoms at this time? Chest pain, shortness of breath, anything like that?
[patient]  I have a little bit of nasal congestion, but that's just for my seasonal allergies.
[doctor]  Okay, all right. Well, I want to go ahead and do a quick physical exam, okay?
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Hey, Dragon, show me the blood pressure.
[doctor]  So yeah, looking at your blood pressure today here in the office, it does look a little elevated still, so we'll have to talk about that. So I'm just going to listen to your heart and your lungs, and we'll go from there, okay?
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  So on physical examination, I don't appreciate any carotid roots in your neck. Your heart on your heart exam. It does show that you have a slight two out of six systolic ejection murmur. You're there. Your lung exam shows nice clear lungs bilaterally, and you do have some trace pitting edema to your lower extremities bilaterally. So what that means is, I think ultimately, you know, we just need to get your blood pressure under better control, OK?
[patient]  MM
[doctor]  Let me just go ahead. I want to take a look at some of your results, okay?
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Hey Dragon, show me the ECG.
[doctor]  Yeah, so in reviewing the results of your EKG, it looks the same as last year. You do have just blood. Those changes from your chronic high blood pressure that will address, okay?
[doctor]  Hey, Dragon, show me the Echo Cardiogram.
[doctor]  And this is just the echocardiogram from just a few months ago that just, you know, show that you have that slightly leaky heart valve, nothing to do for it, and that the heart murmur is stable, okay?
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  So let's just talk a little bit about, you know, my assessment and my plan for you. So for your first problem, your high blood pressure, it's not controlled at this time. So I want to go ahead and increase the lysinopryl to 40 milligrams once a day. I want you to continue to check your blood pressures and report them to me through the patient portal and we'll have to make adjustments if necessary and maybe have to add a second agent, okay?
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  And then for your second problem, I want, you know, for your depression, I don't think that we need to start you on any medication. It sounds like you're doing really well from that standpoint, but you know that you can contact me if you need anything, okay?
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Do you have any questions?
[patient]  No, not at this time.

virtassist,D2N169,"[doctor]  Hi, Ellen, how are you?
[patient]  Hi, good to see you.
[doctor]  Good to see you as well. Are you ready to get started?
[patient]  Yes, I am.
[doctor]  So, Alan is a 61-year-old male. Here with complaints of shortness of breath.
[doctor]  So, Alan, what's going on?
[patient]  So over the weekend, I took a very long bike ride about three hours or so and I got back. I was very light-headed. I was short of breath and it really surprised me because I pretty much bike ride every morning and it was never an issue before. So I'm a little concerned about that.
[doctor]  Okay, and have you had any other symptoms? Have you had any fever?
[patient]  and
[doctor]  Chest pain
[patient]  No, but I felt very light-headed and it was hard to catch my breath afterwards, so maybe I did have a little chest pain, but it eventually went away after about an hour.
[doctor]  Okay, and anyone else sick in your in your family?
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Okay, and any cough?
[patient]  I had a little bit of a cough with my first cold in the last year and a half, but that went away after about a week or so.
[doctor]  Okay, all right. And any other symptoms? I know you went through the review of symptoms.
[patient]  MM
[doctor]  with the nurse but any nausea or vomiting or abdominal pain.
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Okay, alright. Well, I know that I've treated you for migraines in the past. How are you doing with those?
[patient]  That's been under control. I've taken medication, I've avoided bright lights and it's so far so good.
[doctor]  Okay, alright. And I think we had you on Imitrex for that. Have you?
[patient]  Yes, I'm still taking that.
[doctor]  Alright, and then your reflux, how are you doing with that?
[patient]  Managing that as well.
[doctor]  Okay, and everything's working out well with the Prodynix.
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  Okay, and then I know you had the cataract surgery about three months ago. Your vision is okay?
[patient]  That was about 4 and a half months ago, and it's been actually great ever since.
[doctor]  Okay great. Alright well we're gonna go ahead and do a quick physical exam. I want to see your vital signs first.
[patient]  Sure.
[doctor]  Hey Dragon, show me the vital signs.
[doctor]  Okay, so looking here everything looks quite good. Your oxygenation is perfect, which is wonderful. Let me just take a listen.
[doctor]  Deep breath. Another one. Good.
[doctor]  So, on your physical exam, your neck is nice and supple. I don't appreciate any jugular venous distension. Your heart is in a regular rhythm. I don't hear any murmur. Your lungs do have a slight wheeze, expiratory wheeze, bilaterally. I can hear it every time you breathe, and I see trace lower extremity edema in your lower extremities.
[doctor]  So what does all that mean? You know, you, uh, I'm not quite sure yet, but we're going to review some of your results. Hey, dragon, show me the chest X-ray.
[doctor]  So looking here, this is a very normal chest x-ray. I don't see any pulmonary edema. There's no pneumonia. So we're viewing your chest x-ray as it's a norm. It's normal.
[patient]  Good.
[doctor]  So, let's look at your pulmonary function test.
[doctor]  Hey, Dragon, show me your the PFTs. And looking here again, these look quite good. I'm quite encouraged by that. That's normal pulmonary function tests. Hey, Dragon, show me the labs. And all of your labs here look quite good here as well. So I'm very pleased. So right now my impression of you is that you may have had an asthma exacerbation from exercising and with the allergies. So at this point in time, I'd like to go ahead and prescribe you some albuterol inhaler.
[patient]  MM
[doctor]  Two puffs every four hours is needed for wheezing or for shortness of breath. And I'd like to go ahead and order a pulmonary referral for you, okay? Do you have any questions about that?
[patient]  No questions, thanks.
[doctor]  Hey Dragon, order a pulmonary referral. Hey Dragon, order a butyrol inhaler. Two puffs every four hours as needed for shortness of breath.
[doctor]  And then I think from your reflex standpoint, everything seems stable and your migraines. I think that we should just continue on with the imitrex as needed. Does that sound good to you?
[patient]  That sound fine.
[doctor]  I want to see you in a couple weeks and if you have the shortness of breath again, I want you to call me right away, okay?
[patient]  You got it.
[doctor]  All right, good to see you.

virtassist,D2N170,"[doctor]  Hi Joyce, how are you?
[patient]  I'm good. How are you?
[doctor]  I'm doing well. So I know the nurse told you about DAX. I'd like to tell DAX a little bit about you when we get started. Okay.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  All right. So, Joyce is a 50-year-old female with a past medical history, significant for COPD, congestive heart failure, who presents for follow-up to an abnormal lab finding. So, Joyce, I got the results of your lab, your labs, your hemoglobin was low. So, I asked them to schedule a follow-up appointment with me. So, how are you feeling?
[patient]  I've been feeling really tired lately. Over the past couple of months, I've noticed that my energy has really gone down. I used to be really active, just trying to be as healthy as I can be, running, climbing. I at least try to do an hour or two a day. And over the past month, it's gone slowly downhill. I've just been so tired and exhausted and I haven't been able to really keep up with the way I, I was G was going with my exercise.
[doctor]  Okay, alright. Um, now, have you had, have you noticed any blood in your stools at all?
[patient]  Oh no, not really. Not, not at this time.
[doctor]  Okay, and are your stools like dark or charry or black looking?
[patient]  No, not that I've noticed.
[doctor]  Okay, and are you spotting a lot with your periods?
[patient]  No, I'm not.
[doctor]  Okay, all right. Um, and do you have any other, I know that you are endorsing this fatigue and you feel kind of dizzy and that type of thing. Do you have any other symptoms like chest pain, shortness of breath, fever, chills, body aches, anything?
[patient]  No, nothing like that.
[doctor]  Okay. Anyway, it lost?
[patient]  I've noticed a little bit, but that's because I think I've been doing really well with my exercise. But nothing too significant.
[doctor]  Okay, all right. Well, let me ask you a little bit about how's the COPD doing. I know that you've stopped smoking several years ago, but you know, you still have that M, those Enthazima changes on your chest X-ray. So how are you doing with that? How's your breathing?
[patient]  It's been okay. I haven't been smoking. After I quit, I quit cold turkey and I haven't gone back since. So that's been doing well. I think during the changes of season, it gets a little bit harder for me to breathe, but I think that's just because of my allergies.
[doctor]  Okay, alright. And then from a congestive heart failure standpoint, are you watching your diet, you're watching your salt intake?
[patient]  Yeah, I've been doing really well with that. I've been staying away from the French fries and all the other salty foods that I love to eat and everything looks great.
[doctor]  So, French fries are one of my favorite foods, that in fried chicken so...
[doctor]  I give you a lot of credit for staying away from French fries.
[patient]  Thank you.
[doctor]  Okay, so you so no swelling in your legs or any anything like that
[patient]  No, not that I've noticed.
[doctor]  Okay, and you feel like you have a good support system?
[patient]  Yeah, my boyfriend is great and I have my brother right down the road.
[doctor]  Okay, all right. Good. I'm glad to hear that. So let's go ahead. I want to just do a quick physical exam, okay?
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Hey, Dragon, show me the vital signs. All right. Well, your vital signs here in the office look good, so I'm really happy to see that with the abnormal hemoglobin that we saw. Um, I'm going to just listen to your heart and lungs and press on your belly a little bit, and I'll let you know if I find anything, okay?
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  All right. Okay. All right. So on physical exam, you know, I don't appreciate anything's cervical lymphedena pathy. Your heart sounds really good, but I do hear a slight two out of six systolic heart murmur, systolic ejection murmur on your heart exam. Your lungs sound clear. Your abdomen, you know, you did have a little tenderness to palpation in your right lower quadrant on your abdominal exam, but I don't appreciate any lower extremity edema. So all that means that we, you know, we hear that heart murmur, which we heard in the past, and your belly had some tenderness. So we'll have to talk about that a little bit going forward. Okay.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Let's look at some of your results, okay?
[patient]  MM
[doctor]  Hey, Dragon, show me the hemoglobin. So here, looking at this, you know, your hemoglobin level is 8.2. Somebody like you should have a hemoglobin O of about 13, 14, okay?
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  So we need to investigate why it's low. Hey, Dragon, show me the Anemia Labs. Okay, so looking here at your labs, uh, everything looks good from, from this standpoint. I think some of your Anemia Labs are still pending at this time. That's part of the workup.
[patient]  MM
[doctor]  So let's go over a little bit about the assessment and plan for you. So you know, your main problem, this abnormal lab, this low hemoglobin that we found. So you're anemic and weenay. You know, I'm waiting for those anemia labs to come back to find out exactly, you know, what type of anemia you have. I'd like to go ahead and schedule you for an endoscopy, and a colonoscopy just to make sure that you're not bleeding from your inside your belly, okay? And I'll be in touch when those labs come back to see what further work up we need to do, okay?
[patient]  MM
[doctor]  For your next problem, the COPD, I think you're doing great. You know, I don't think that you need any further referrals at this time for that. I would just continue staying away from smoking. It doesn't sound to be like you need any inhalers at this time. For your third problem, your congestive heart failure, you know, I want to continue you on the toprol, continue you on the lysinoprol, and we'll continue you on your current diuretic dosing of 20, LASIX 20 milligrams a day.
[doctor]  I'm going to go ahead and order that referral to G to gastroenterology. They're the ones who will do the endoscopy and the colonoscopy, okay?
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Hey, Dragon, order the referral to gastroenterology. So, I'll be in touch. I'm going to stay in close contact with you over the next week or so, and we'll get this all sorted out, okay?
[patient]  Okay.

[doctor]  So Evelyn is a 56 year old female with a past medical history significant for coronary artery disease, prior carpal tunnel release, and a herniated disc who presents for her annual exam. So Evelyn, it's been a little while since I've seen you. How have you been doing over the last year?
[patient]  I've been doing okay. Everything with my herniated disc and my back has been doing really well. I haven't had any back pain or any limitations in movement, so that's been doing well.
[doctor]  Okay, yeah, I know that we have done a steroid injection for that a couple of months, several months ago, so that's doing well.
[patient]  Yeah, it is.
[doctor]  Okay, I'm glad to hear that. And then, how about your carpal tunnel issues? You had that fixed a couple of years ago. So are you having any recurrent issues or are you good? You back to work?
[patient]  I'm back to work. I haven't had any issues and I've had full range of motion and it feels really good.
[doctor]  Alright, so no numbing and tingling in your hands?
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Okay, that's good. And then, you know, I know that you've had a prior stenting in the past for you, for your heart and your heart vessels.
[patient]  MM
[doctor]  How are you doing from that standpoint? Have you had any chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, or vomiting?
[patient]  Over the last month I've been having a bit of chest pain, but I haven't had any of the other symptoms you mentioned.
[doctor]  Okay, does the chest pain happen when you walk?
[patient]  Yeah, it does.
[doctor]  Okay, and does it, does it go away if you, if you rest?
[patient]  Yeah, it does actually.
[doctor]  Okay, alright. Do you ever get it just sitting there at rest?
[patient]  No, I don't.
[doctor]  Okay, alright. Okay, and can you describe it?
[patient]  It's like a burn.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  It just feels like it's burning, nothing terribly concerning, not enough to send me to the urr, but I do notice it.
[doctor]  Okay, and where exactly is it located in your chest?
[patient]  Just dump right in the middle.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  Right here.
[doctor]  Okay. And how often are you getting it?
[patient]  Um, probably about three, three times a week.
[doctor]  Okay, alright. Well, I'm glad that you talked about that with me today. I know the nurse did a review of system sheet with you, and you know, you're obviously endorsing this, this chest pressure. Have you had any other symptoms? I know the other ones that you haven't had, but any lower extremity edema or muscle aches or fever chills.
[patient]  No, nothing like that, but I have had a little bit of congestion just from allergies because of the pollen.
[doctor]  Okay, so you're endorsing some nasal congestion?
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  All right, well let's go ahead and we'll do a physical exam, okay?
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Hey, dragon, show me the vital signs. So here your vital signs look really good. I'm happy to see that your blood pressure is under, under good control, and your oxygenation is fine. So I'm just going to take a listen to your heart and lungs, and I'll let you know if I find anything, okay?
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Okay, so in physical exam your heart has a slight three out of six systolic ejection murmur, which we've heard before. Your lungs are nice and clear. I don't appreciate any carotid boots and and you have no lower extremity edema. You have healed surgical scars on your on your right wrist. So let's go ahead. I want to look at some of your results, okay?
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Hey, dragon, show me the echocardiogram. So this is the echocardiogram from last year. You did have a slightly low pumping function of your heart at 45%, but I suspected that will improve over time. And you did have some slight what we call my troll regurgitation. That's just a leaky heart valve. And that's that murmur that I heard. Hey, dragon, show me the ECG. And here, in reviewing your results of your ECG, it looks stable. It just kind of reflects your prior coronary artery disease. There's no new changes, which is good. So let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you.
[doctor]  So, from your first problem, you know, your carpal tunnel release, I don't think that we need to anything further about that, because you seem to be doing really well, your back at work, if you have any recurring symptoms, just let me know, and we can take it from there. For your next problem, your herniated disc, that also sounds like you're doing really well. I don't think that we need to refer you for any further steroid injection or physical therapy at this time. So, if you have recurrent symptoms, I want you to let me know. And finally, your last problem, the most concerning problem to me, is your known coronary artery disease, and this recurrent chest pain you have.
[doctor]  So I want to go ahead and continue you on your aspirin and your toprol, okay? I want to go ahead and order a stress test for you to see if you have more blockages that could be causing this chest discomfort, okay?
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  And I'm gonna go ahead and get a lipid panel and start you on Crestor 20 milligrams once a day, okay?
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Hey, Dragon, order a cardiac stress test. Do you have any questions?
[patient]  No, that's it.
[doctor]  Okay, all right. Hey dragon, finalize the note. So it was good to see you. The nurse will come in. She'll help you get your scheduled for all of those things and I'll be in touch, okay?
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Take care.","CHIEF COMPLAINT

[doctor]  It's good to see you.
[patient]  Good to see you too.
[doctor]  I know my nurse has already told you about DAX. Is it okay if I tell DAX a little bit about you?
[patient]  Go for it.
[doctor]  All right, so Natalie is a 39-year-old female here today for a checkup for an abnormal lab. She's got a history of high blood pressure, diabetes, and ACL repair.
[doctor]  So, tell me what's going on.
[patient]  So I got some routine blood work done last week and they said that my blood sugars were were high so that I should come in and talk to you and get some more work done and see why that is.
[doctor]  Okay, well, were you having any symptoms at all or just we had some blood work done routinely? Any chest pain, shortness of breath, any nausea, vomiting or diarrhea?
[patient]  No, no symptoms. Uh, so I was a little shocked when I came back high-end and elevated, so hopefully we can figure out what's going on.
[doctor]  We've been kind of checking on this for a while and you've been on Metformin. We actually increased your dose last time.
[patient]  Yep.
[doctor]  So right now you're on 100, 1000 milligrams a day correct?
[patient]  Correct. Yup.
[doctor]  Okay. Alright. No... uh, no difficulty urinating or burning when you urinate at all.
[patient]  Nope.
[doctor]  Okay, all right. Um, hey, Dragon, show me the hemoglobin A1c. So in reviewing your, that's the lab that we checked after when I saw before I walked in. It says 8.1, which is elevated. So I think we need to do a maybe a better job with adjusting your medication.
[doctor]  How are you doing with your diet for your diabetes?
[patient]  My diet's been really great lately. I've been avoiding sugars, been really watching my weight and power walking every day. So I was a little surprised when the blood work came back that I had an elevated test.
[doctor]  Okay, and have you had any other? Are you checking your blood sugars in the morning or your fasting blood sugars?
[patient]  Yes, I am.
[doctor]  Okay, alright. How are you doing with your high blood pressure?
[patient]  That's been good and stable. I've been stable on a medication, been taking that every day. And I have a cup at home to measure myself and that everything's been normal.
[doctor]  Okay, great. And how's your knee doing that's the other issue we've been kind of following? You had some surgery done for that?
[patient]  Yeah, about five years ago, I had an ACL repair on my right knee and everything's been going well so far. I haven't had any issues with mobility. It's been great.
[doctor]  And you're pretty physically active and doing exercises?
[patient]  Yeah, I've been power walking about at least 30 minutes every day.
[doctor]  Okay, great. Well, let's review some of your vital signs. Hey, Dragon, show me the vitals. All right, blood pressure looks good right now. Your oxygen levels great. Your temperature's good.
[doctor]  So I know you checked in with the review of systems with my assistant before coming in. Uh, anything else bothering you today? Except for the abnormal blood work? No chest pain? No shortness of breath?
[patient]  No, nothing like that.
[doctor]  No headaches? No belly pain?
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Good. Great. Well, let me examine you, okay?
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Alright, just going to listen to your heart here.
[doctor]  No belly pain?
[patient]  Nope.
[doctor]  Okay.
[doctor]  So on exam, your hent or your neck exam is fine. Your eyes look fine. Your lungs are clear. I do hear a systolic ejection murmur about three over six. Your belly's nice and soft. No swelling in your legs or extremities right now.
[doctor]  So let's talk about some of the issues today. All right, for the first issue, for the diabetes, since your hemoglobin A1C is elevated, and you're already on 1,000 milligrams of metformin, I think we should add a Giardience 10 milligrams a day. So that's a new medication. We'll start that. I do want you to follow your diet pretty aggressively. I want to see if we can get that hemoglobin A1C down the next time.
[doctor]  I'm also going to add some labs today to see what that to see a lipid panel and some other blood work. Hey, Dragon, Order a CBC, CMP, and a lipid panel. And I'll go ahead and prescribe the Giardience, 10 milligrams a day. Hey, Dragon, prescribe a Order Giardience, 10 milligrams a day.
[doctor]  All right, for the high blood pressure, I think you're doing great. You're on my synoprol for that, so I think that we should continue that. Uh, we'll recheck it again next time, and you are monitoring that at home, correct?
[patient]  Yes, I am.

[doctor]  So, Bruce, I saw you a couple months ago.
[patient]  MM
[doctor]  How are you doing?
[patient]  It's been a crazy year and a half. And I think the other anxiety, the pressure of getting ready for Thanksgiving was really started to wear on me.
[doctor]  Okay.
[doctor]  Did you have a nice holiday?
[patient]  I did, but it was great to see everybody after about two years, but it was just a lot of work.
[patient]  A lot of stress.
[doctor]  Yeah, yeah. And what do you have to look forward for like the new year and that type of thing? Are you more gatherings like that?
[patient]  I'm planning to take a vacation, so hopefully somewhere nice and warm.
[doctor]  Okay, alright. Well, how are you doing in terms of your depression? I know that we've kind of talked about this in the past.
[patient]  MM
[doctor]  And we haven't put you on medication because you're on other meds and you haven't really wanted to do that, so what strategies are you using?
[patient]  Yeah, over the summer we tried something new. I started going for long walks outside every morning. The weather was so nice and all the plants were in full bloom that I loved to start my day that way. On the weekends, it even encouraged me to do a little in the yard myself, which was a nice way to be active and get some sun. But with the seasons changing and it getting so cold out, I have not been able to keep doing it and need to find something new to do. I'm not ready yet to try any meds, so I think I'd like to look into some alternative options.
[doctor]  Okay. So yeah. So we can talk about some therapy and
[patient]  Sure.
[doctor]  That type of thing.
[patient]  Sure.
[doctor]  All right, and no, you don't want to harm yourself or others.
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Any thoughts like that?
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  No, okay. And then in terms of your diabetes, how are you doing, you know, especially with the holidays managing your sugar intake and that type of thing?
[patient]  uh got through Halloween okay didn't stick to the diet too much through the thanksgiving week but it's a little bit better so i've been trying to really monitor it
[doctor]  Okay. And are you you're still taking them at form and correct?
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  Okay, alright. And then in terms of your high blood pressure, did you buy the blood pressure cuff that I recommended?
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  Okay, and how have they been running? I haven't received any You Know Notes from you in the portal.
[patient]  Nothing out of the ordinary. It's been pretty moderate.
[doctor]  It's been pretty good. And you're still taking the Lice Cinnaprol? No problems with that?
[patient]  MM. Correct.
[doctor]  Okay, alright. I know you did a review of system sheet when you checked in.
[patient]  MM
[doctor]  Do you have any symptoms? Chest pain, shortness of breath, belly pain.
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Blood in your stool.
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Weight loss. Anything like that?
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Okay, alright. I want to go ahead and do a quick physical exam.
[patient]  MM
[doctor]  Hey Dragon, show me the vital signs.
[doctor]  So here in the office, I agree. Your blood pressure looks good. Uh, I think you're doing a good job with that. So keep up the good work. I'm going to go ahead and take a listen to your heart and lungs. I'll let you know what I find.
[patient]  Sure.
[doctor]  Alright, so on physical examination, everything looks pretty good. So on your neck exam, I don't appreciate any carotid breads. On your heart exam, I do appreciate a slight two out of six systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base, which we've heard in the past.
[patient]  MM
[doctor]  your lungs are nice and clear, and you do have a 1 plus non-pitting edema bilaterally in your lower extremities. So what does all that mean?
[doctor]  It just means I heard a little sound in your heart, which you know isn't anything clinically significant. We had looked into that last year.
[patient]  MM
[doctor]  You do have a little swelling in your legs, but that might just be from your diet recently, okay?
[patient]  Sure.
[doctor]  I want to just take a look at some of your results. Hey Dragon, show me the EKG.
[doctor]  So I just had the nurse do an EKG on you before you came and just to make sure we weren't missing anything. You're in your 60s, we have some risk factors. Everything looks good.
[patient]  MM
[doctor]  There's no evidence that I'm concerned about anything at this time. Hey dragon, show me the diabetes logs.
[doctor]  So on your diabetic labs, your hemoglobin A1c is elevated. It's at 8. I'd like to see it closer to 6.
[doctor]  Now some of them might be having to do with the holidays that type of thing, but I still think that we need to get that under better control.
[patient]  Sure.
[doctor]  So let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you. So for your first problem of your depression, I'd like to just go ahead and refer you to a psychiatry not for medications. But just for some talk therapy, that type of thing, okay?
[patient]  That's fine.
[doctor]  For your second problem of your type 2 diabetes, I'd like to go ahead and order a hemoglobin A1c in the next couple months. I want to increase them at 4min to 1000mg twice a day. And we're going to go ahead and order a lipid panel, okay?
[patient]  MM
[doctor]  Lastly, for your third problem for your hypertension, I'm going to go ahead and order an echocardiogram just to reach out to it. Just that heart murmur. And I'm going to go ahead and keep the lysinopril at 20 milligrams a day. Do you have any questions?
[patient]  No questions.
[doctor]  Okay, the nurse will be in soon. She'll get you checked out, okay?
[patient]  You got it.

[doctor]  I. Maria. How you been doing?
[patient]  Same I guess. Pretty good.
[doctor]  Okay, so you got my letter last time on the results. Your sugars are not very well controlled.
[patient]  Yeah, I got them.
[doctor]  Okay, so did you increase your glimpy ride?
[patient]  Did I increase it?
[doctor]  Yeah.
[patient]  I'm still taking the 2 mg.
[doctor]  Yeah. So we want you to, as the letter said, from the last time, when your A1c was 9.9, we wanted you to increase it to 4 milligrams twice a day. So let's start that.

[doctor]  Yes. Uh, how much of a do you have?
[patient]  Why just filled it?

[patient]  Oh well.
[doctor]  Not really?
[patient]  Well, I haven't had any pasta. I just don't really like it, so we don't have any in the house. We don't often have bread, and if we do, we buy wheat bread.
[doctor]  Okay, but even the wheat bread, try to cut down on the number of slices you eat per day.
[patient]  I just usually have two in the morning. I don't care for sandwiches much. Maybe peanut butter sandwiches once in a while.

[patient]  Yep, I just got new glasses.
[doctor]  Okay. Who do you go see?
[patient]  I go to Liberty Road, the group up there.
[doctor]  Okay, the optimal optometrist, right?
[patient]  They keep changing doctors each time I go.
[doctor]  A new doc each time?
[patient]  Yeah, I got a really nice one I used to see a year ago.
[doctor]  Was that Dr. Sanchez?
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  Okay, and you saw him not too long ago?
[patient]  Yeah, I just got my prescription from him. Well, see, I had the iodine for my eyes.
[doctor]  Cataracts. Yep, okay.
[patient]  So he did that and then I had to wait for a month to get healed up and then he wrote my prescription.
[doctor]  Perfect. And then you've got the high blood pressure.
[patient]  Yeah, a couple of weeks ago, it was 116 on the dot.
[doctor]  Okay, well, we will recheck it. You're on a combination of medications. You are on the Met Met, uh, Metaprolol, 50 milligrams once a day. You're on the Lycinaprol with hydrochlorothiazide at 20, with 25 milligrams once a day, and you're on the Emlodipine, 10 milligrams once a day. Are you taking all of those?

[doctor]  Perfect. And then you've got the high cholesterol and the vascular disease in your legs. You're on Adder Vastatin. Are you tolerating it okay?
[patient]  Yeah, but honestly my feet feel like hell.
[doctor]  Yeah.
[patient]  All the time, my legs are bugging me. I can't do much walking.
[doctor]  Okay. Yeah, the feed I think is what we call peripheral neuropathy.
[patient]  Also, I have the paint up to my hip.
[doctor]  Okay, you have pain in the hips and upper legs?
[patient]  Yeah, all of it.
[doctor]  Okay, so those do seem relatively stable, right? And are you trying to get the walking in?
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  Okay. And you are smoking still?
[patient]  Yeah, still smoking.
[doctor]  not ready to quit
[patient]  No, not really.
[doctor]  It's a bad combination.
[patient]  I know. I'll think about it.
[doctor]  Okay, now let's do my review of systems. You're not having any headaches or dizziness.
[patient]  headaches or dizziness now?
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  Nothing, feeling totally normal.
[doctor]  Good good. And the vision is better with the cataract surgery? That's been good.
[patient]  Yeah, not happy with this lens, it's kind of funny. The other one is good.
[doctor]  Hmm, sometimes they can go in and clean up the eye with laser, but we'll see what they say.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Okay. No shortness of breath or coughing.
[patient]  I've been coughing here lately because I've been congested.
[doctor]  What does it look like when it comes up?
[patient]  It's relatively clear.
[doctor]  No fever, chills, no shortness of breath?
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Okay. No chest pains or pressure or tightness.
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  nausea, vomiting, GI symptoms?
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Okay. Ping okay?
[patient]  Not good. It's, you know, I'm old. It takes me a little more time.
[doctor]  slower stream but stable.
[patient]  Yes, but I do pee.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  several times per day.
[doctor]  Hmm. How many times do you have to get up at night?
[patient]  Not too bad just once in a while.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  Then I have to pee by morning. I do tend to drink my drinks in the evening.
[doctor]  Okay. Alright, let's have a look at you.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Physical exam, carotids are normal, pulses no bits. Heart exam, rhythm is regular, normal rate, S1 and S2 are crisp. I do not hear any murmurs today, okay. Have you leaned forward for me? Take some deep breaths in and out. Okay, lungs are clear. I don't hear any rasps or weezing today.
[patient]  My coffin got better this morning.
[doctor]  You cleared out the lungs? Alright, let me take a look at your feet.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Okay, extremities are without a demon. Pulses are palpable on the Dorsalus-Petus posterior tibial. She has thickened nails.
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  Yeah. Mildly dry skin. No skin breakdown. Oh, let me know if you can feel this.
[patient]  Okay, I close my eyes. Yeah, yeah, okay.
[doctor]  mildly decrease sensation in the tips of the first and second toes. Okay, we're done with your exam.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Okay, so again, try to keep the feet moisturized.
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  You do have a little bit of peryphi, peripheral neuropathy. There is a medication we can use if they get really bad, but you're already on so many medications.
[patient]  My girl that I talk to and stuff, she uses on her feet. She really likes it. It's like a foot scrub or some type of cream. I put it on when I think of it after the shower, so I could get my own instead.
[doctor]  That sounds good. So for now your sugars, we're going to check your, we're going to recheck your blood work today. But the sugars last time we checked, the A1C, your blood sugar average was above 9. I really want you to increase the glimpy ride. So the ones you have at home, the 2 milligram, take two of them twice a day.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Okay, watch for low sugars, weak, shaky, sweaty. If that happens, let us know, and I don't expect it too.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Okay, the new prescription that I'm going to write is going to be for the, uh, for milligram pill. So when you get the new one, just one pill twice a day. Also, continue them at four men, okay? Blood pressure. When I rechecked it, I got 140 over 60 asks, so the numbers at home are better. So we're going to continue the combination of medications. We'll check kidney function today.
[doctor]  For your cholesterol though, you're on the high dose of adervastatin or lipitor to protect the arteries, so we really want to keep you on that.
[patient]  Yeah, no problem.
[doctor]  I want you to quit smoking, but we've had this battle before.
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  And then we will leave everything else the same. We'll get the labs today and we'll see you back here in four months. Sound good?
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Great. Have a good day, ma'am. Take care of yourself.
[patient]  Thank you. You too.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Maria Martin is a 75-year-old female who presents today for follow-up for diabetes.

The patient’s blood glucose levels are poorly controlled and her most recent hemoglobin A1C is 9.9%. She denies increasing glimepiride to 4 mg twice a day as advised but confirms she is compliant with 2 mg twice a day. She mostly denies reducing sugar and carbohydrate intake, although she opts for wheat bread, she does not have pasta at home, and she does not drink much soda and instead drinks club soda or seltzer water. She reports that her diabetic eye exams are up to date and she follows with Dr. Sanchez at Optimum Optometrists. She recently underwent cataract surgery and received a new prescription for her glasses, noting improvement in her vision to one eye and displeasure with the lens in her other eye.

She confirms compliancy with her blood pressure medications of metoprolol 50 mg daily, lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide 20/25 mg daily, and amlodipine 10 mg daily. The patient intermittently completes at home blood pressure checks and reported seeing a systolic BP of 116 a few weeks ago. She is also compliant with her atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia and reports tolerating it well.

The patient is still experiencing bilateral hip, thigh, and foot pain related to peripheral neuropathy, noting her mobility is limited but she is walking as tolerated.

Ms. Martin does continue to smoke cigarettes and denies interest in cessation, although she agreed to begin thinking about it.

She is currently experiencing a productive cough with clear sputum that she attributes to her recent congestion.

The patient is also experiencing a slower urine stream, but it appears stable, and she contributes her urinary symptoms to aging. She also has nocturia on occasion which she contributes to her increased fluid intake in the evenings.

Glimepiride 4mg tablet. Take 2 tablets by oral route 2 times per day.

VITALS

Blood pressure 140/60.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Respiratory
No rasping, wheezing.

Cardiovascular
Normal heart rate and regular rhythm. Carotids and pulses are normal. S1 and S2 are crisp. No murmurs.

Gastrointestinal
No nausea or vomiting.

Extremities
Bilateral Diabetic Foot Exam: No edema with palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses bilaterally. No skin breakdown. Thickened nails.
Sensory Examination: Mildly decreased sensation in the tips of the first and second toes bilaterally.

RESULTS

Hemoglobin A1C 9.9%.

ASSESSMENT

• Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
• Hypertension.
• Hyperlipidemia.
• Peripheral vascular disease.

PLAN

Type 2 diabetes mellitus
Increase glimepiride to 4 mg tablets two times per day. I counselled patient on the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia, although I don’t think she is at a great risk of hypoglycemia. There will be no change to her metformin dose. I counselled the patient on limiting her carbohydrate intake to support improved glycemia. We will recheck her Hemoglobin A1c and complete a kidney function test today.

Peripheral vascular disease
I counselled patient on improving frequency of moisturizing her feet. Improved glycemia would also benefit her neuropathy. If symptoms worsen, we will consider medication to control symptoms, but not at this time due to the patient has already reached polypharmacy.

Hypertension
Blood pressure appears to be well controlled based on checks completed at home. The patient will continue with amlodipine, metoprolol, and lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide.

Hyperlipidemia
I will continue with atorvastatin as previously prescribed. If patient were to improve her diet, this would likely be beneficial as well.

INSTRUCTIONS

Finish current prescription of glimepiride 2 mg, 2 tablets 2 times per day. Refill will be 4 mg tablet, 1 tablet 2 times per day. Reduce carbohydrate intake overall to improve glycemia. Call the office with questions or any signs or symptoms of hypoglycemia.

[doctor]  Hello, Mr. Cook. How are you doing this morning?
[patient]  Hi, Dr. Martinez. This weekend was a bit rough. I've had this numbness and tingling for a few weeks now.
[doctor]  So it's in both of your hands.
[patient]  Yes, ever since my car rec last December when I broke them. Well, once they healed, I mean I noticed it more, the tingling and the numbness.
[doctor]  And you still wear the splint only on the right wrist?
[patient]  No, I also wear the left sometimes. The ride is just worse, but the splint helps. Both have really gotten worse over the last month. When I broke them, my right wrist was definitely in worse shape. I've also been having some s-mild stiffness in my neck too. I hit my head during the accident and they told me it was a contusion.
[doctor]  And where would you say the tingling and numbness is?
[patient]  On this side, it goes from here and here up to about here. On the other side, it's from here to here.
[doctor]  I see. So on the right side, you're pointing from the middle and ring finger all the way up the form. And on the left, the symptoms extend from the pinky and ring finger. And is there any pain or just tingling and numbness?
[patient]  Eh, it's mainly just sore. Sometimes they throb, but overall, they feel weak or too, especially when I'm using them. The tingling happens more when they hurt, but when it goes away, the tingling is dull.
[doctor]  And when do you feel these symptoms?
[patient]  Well, really I guess just more so at night and they come and go throughout the day.
[doctor]  Okay, and do you experience any loss of sensation in your hands or fingers?
[patient]  Like feeling something? No, not that I can really think of. Though, in general, they may be less sensitive than they should be, but I can still feel. They also gave me some nerve pain medicine, but I haven't been taking it like I should.
[doctor]  And are you still on the core egg for hypertension and the lexapro for anxiety?
[patient]  Yes, I'm still taking those. I had pre-diabetes too, but I got it under control by changing my diet.
[doctor]  And no history of thyroid issues, correct?
[patient]  Nope.
[doctor]  All right, thank you, Mr. Cook. Okay, first we'll go over your review of systems. Correct me if I'm wrong in any of this.
[doctor]  Constitutional, you have fatigue and weight gain, GI, you have excessive appetite and bloating, eyes have floaters, cardiovascular shows shortness of breath and like swelling, endocrine, you're always hungry, skin, you have some nail bed changes, dryness, itching, musculoskeletal, you have gout and muscle pain, and the remainder of the review of systems is negative.
[patient]  Yep, that's all correct.
[doctor]  Alright, we're going to go ahead and do the neurologic examination. Let's look at the right hand first. Can you feel this?
[patient]  Yeah, but a little less on these two fingers.
[doctor]  Sensation is normal, except pin-prick sensation diminished in third and fourth fingers on the right.
[doctor]  and how about on the left?
[patient]  Um, yeah, but these two a little less.
[doctor]  Sensation is decreased in the fourth and fifth fingers on the left.
[doctor]  Okay, let's test your reflexes now. Reflexes are 1 plus and symmetric. 2 plus knees. Toes are down going bilaterally.
[doctor]  Alright, I'm going to tap on your right wrist. Do you feel anything?
[patient]  Yeah, it feels like a zing up my wrist and something into my elbow too.
[doctor]  And how about the left side?
[patient]  Yeah, same on that side too.
[doctor]  to null-sign positive at both wrists and both elbows. Rest of exam is normal.
[doctor]  Alright, so what I am seeing today is bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome or potentially, this could also be bilateral cubital tunnel syndrome. However, your symptom presentation suggests car bilateral carpal syndrome as the nerve in your wrists are aggravated by your past trauma. This is causing the pain and tingling you were describing to me.
[patient]  Okay, so how do we make it better?
[doctor]  First, I want to determine exactly where the nerve irritation is coming from. We'll need to schedule you for a nerve test, which is called an EMG test. They will measure the responsiveness of your nerves to truly pinpoint where you are having your issues.
[patient]  That sounds fine to me.
[doctor]  Great! After the tests are complete, you can return here for a follow-up visit. If you're still having symptoms, we can consider a referral to our hand clinic, possibly for injections or carpal tunnel release essay, surgery. You could also refer, we could also refer you to an orthopedist for the same treatment.
[patient]  Sounds good, Doc.
[doctor]  Alright, keep wearing your splints and I will see you after those studies.
[patient]  Thank you.","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Numbness and tingling of both hands.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Elijah Cook is a 60-year-old male referred today for evaluation of numbness and tingling of both hands.

The patient complains of numbness, tingling, and pain in both hands which began in 12/2019 after he broke both wrists in a motor vehicle accident and which has progressively worsened since then. He continues to wear a splint on the right wrist all the time and on the left only intermittently, which he states is because the right wrist was injured more severely in the accident. The sensation radiates from the hands into the forearms and is equal bilaterally. The 4th and 5th fingers in the left hand and 3rd and 4th on the right-hand tingle. He states that his fingers are sore with palpation and seem weaker than before. Any exertion exacerbates the tingling, and after something exacerbates the pain, the tingling seems ""dull"". The symptoms come and go and seem to occur mostly at night. He denies complete loss of sensation in any of his fingers, but states that they seem less sensitive than they should be. He reports mild stiffness in his neck. He notes that he did hit his head during the car accident and was diagnosed with a contusion. He states that he has been given ""nerve pain medicine” but has not been taking it.

He currently takes Coreg for his hypertension and Lexapro for his anxiety. He reports a history of prediabetes, which he has brought under control via dietary changes. He denies any history of thyroid issues.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

• Constitutional Symptoms: Easily fatigued, weight gain.
• Eyes: Floaters.
• Cardiovascular: Bilateral peripheral edema.
• Respiratory: Shortness of breath.
• Gastrointestinal: Excessive appetite, abdominal bloating.
• Musculoskeletal: Gout, muscle pain.
• Integumentary: Dry itchy skin, nail bed changes.
• Endocrine: Excessive hunger.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Neurological
Pinprick sensation intact in the 3rd and 4th fingers on the right hand and 4th and 5th fingers on the left hand. Reflexes are 1+ and symmetric, 2+ knees. Toes down going bilaterally. Tinel’s sign positive at both wrists and elbows.

ASSESSMENT

• Bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome
Mr. Cook is a 60-year-old male referred today for evaluation of numbness and tingling of both hands. His symptom presentation and exam findings today suggest this is bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome or, potentially, this could also be bilateral cubital tunnel syndrome.

PLAN

Diagnosis discussed with patient, I explained that the nerves in his wrists are aggravated by the past trauma causing the pain and tingling. Further testing is indicated to measure the responsiveness of the nerves to determine exactly where the nerve irritation is coming from. We will plan for a follow-up visit after the EMG testing is performed. If still symptomatic, we can consider a referral to our Hand Clinic possibly for injections or carpal tunnel release surgery. We could also refer to an orthopedist for the same treatment.

[doctor]  Hello, are you Mrs. King?
[patient]  I am.
[doctor]  I'm Dr. Phillips. Very nice to meet you.
[patient]  You as well.
[doctor]  How can I help you today?
[patient]  Well, my primary doctor, Dr. Scott, he refer me here.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  I've just got really bad acid reflux.
[doctor]  Okay. Can you tell me more about it?
[patient]  Yeah, though I mean I, right now, I take 40 milligrams of a meprizol twice a day. Some days, it is fine, but others are just really bad.
[doctor]  What do you feel?
[patient]  It feels like burning.
[doctor]  in your chest.
[patient]  Yes, in my chest, and also in my throat.
[doctor]  in your throat and chest. All right. Any difficulty with swallowing? Feels like food or liquids kind of get stuck.
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Okay. That's good. Any abdominal pain?
[patient]  No, not really.
[doctor]  nausea or vomiting, changes in bowel movements.
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  constipation, diarrhea, rectal bleeding.
[patient]  Nope.
[doctor]  Okay, very good. And how long have you had this problem?
[patient]  I've had acid reflux since I was around 12, but it has gotten worse over the past few years.
[doctor]  Okay. And how long have you been on the Omeppersol?
[patient]  On the way, it is now I think about a year.
[doctor]  Okay. Do you find that it's done anything for you in the past?
[patient]  I mean, I can tell it's helped because some days I'll be fine. And then some days, I eat something and it feels terrible.
[doctor]  Are there any things that make your symptoms worse that you can pinpoint, like food choices or stress?
[patient]  Sure, probably stress and food choices sometimes.
[doctor]  Okay. What things bother you?
[patient]  Spicy foods. So I try not to eat them too often, but sometimes even drinking a soda can cause it.
[doctor]  We do know that caffeine and caffeinated beverages will do that even so does. Um, even just the carbonation can cause that. How about tomato based products or citrus products?
[patient]  Yeah, sometimes, but I still eat them.
[doctor]  Okay, it's reassuring that you aren't having any difficulty swallowing though. How's your weight been? Pretty stable?
[patient]  I'd say pretty stable, although I haven't had much of an appetite for the past two months. I have been under a lot of work stress.
[doctor]  What do you do for work?
[patient]  I'm a paralegal.
[doctor]  Okay, and any family history of GI issues?
[patient]  um... my grandmother had a soft joe cancer
[doctor]  on your mom or dad's side.
[patient]  Mom's side and my mom had some issues like acid reflux and she was taking some medication that coats the lining of your stomach.
[doctor]  Okay. Have you ever had an upper endoscopy?
[patient]  I think maybe when I was younger.
[doctor]  But not in the last 10 years?
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Have you ever tried any medication other than a mepazol?
[patient]  At one point I was on a mepazol and ranititine dine. It did help, but other than that, those are the only medications I've taken.
[doctor]  Okay, have a seat here and let me listen to your heart and lungs and then we can talk about a plan for you.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  So, normal physical exam per my new patient template, except for well-heeled abdominal surgical scars noted. What's the surgical scar here on your abdomen from?
[patient]  I always forget about that surgery. I had it when I was a baby. My mom said my intestines were twisted. So I had to have surgery when I was around one month old.
[doctor]  HM, Gacha. Okay, so let's talk about what you're going on. From what you've told me, it sounds like you've had a several year history of GERD, which is the medical term for acid reflux. And recently your symptoms have been poorly controlled with the Omepprazole, 40 milligrams twice daily. You've been having heartburn despite taking this medication, correct?
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  And you've identified trigger foods like spicy foods, carbonated bev, beverages, citrus, and tomato-based foods, but you haven't cut these foods out of your diet completely yet. So the first thing I'd try is changing your diet because these foods can exacerbate your gird, even though you're taking the PPI.
[patient]  Okay, yeah, I could definitely do a better job of avoiding those foods.
[doctor]  Great! So stress is another trigger that we need to address. High stress can cause worsening of your symptoms.
[patient]  Yeah, stress and anxiety are definitely big problems for me.
[doctor]  So, working on that may help with your GERD. Additionally, we can consider trying a different PPI since the only one you've tried up to this point is Omeppresol. If you're okay with this, we can switch your Omeppresol to Nexium.
[patient]  That's fine with me. I'm definitely open to trying whatever.
[doctor]  Perfect. I will send a prescription for next year's 40mg twice daily to your pharmacy on file. I'll also recommend that you have a procedure called a EGD or upper endoscopy to look for potential causes of the gird. We'd sedate you and then pass a small camera through your mouth, down your throat, through your stomach, and end in the small intestines. We'd look for any ulcers or signs of precancerous or cancerous conditions that we can take biopsies at the same time if we see anything.
[patient]  Okay, can I schedule that today?
[doctor]  Yeah, you can get scheduled at checkout desk. I'll have you follow up with me in the office for the EGD, so we can discuss the results and talk about how you're doing with the dietary, stress, and medication changes. How does all of that sound?
[patient]  That sounds good.
[doctor]  Perfect. I will walk you to the checkout desk. Be sure to call my office and let me know if anything changes, or if you have problems before your EGD and follow-up appointment.
[doctor]  Please insert the procedure paragraph in the plan. I suspect that she likely has girded with underlying functional ideology as well. reassuringly, she has no unintentional weight loss and denies any dysphagia. If her EGD is normal and her symptoms purse, persist despite a trial of nexium, we can consider a trial of prognics and obtain a pH impedance study. This will allow us to rule out abnormal acid reflux exposure and to decipher between a functional ideology and hypersensitivity.","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Acid reflux.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Michelle King is a 35 y.o. female who presents to clinic today for a new patient evaluation of acid reflux. She was referred by her primary care physician, Dr. Scott.

The patient reports severe acid reflux that has increased in severity in recent years. She explains that she has struggled with acid reflux since approximately age 12 and she describes a burning sensation in her chest that travels up her esophagus. She denies any dysphagia, abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, changes in bowel movements, constipation, diarrhea, and rectal bleeding. She also denies any unintentional weight loss, although she admits to having a poor appetite due to her being under immense stress for the past 2 months. She has identified triggers for her symptoms, including stress, spicy foods, soda, and citrus or tomato-based products. She admits that she does still eat her trigger foods sometimes despite the exacerbation of her symptoms.

Ms. King has been taking omeprazole 40 mg twice daily for approximately 1 year. She believes that the use of omeprazole provides some relief of her symptoms as there are some days when she is asymptomatic. The only other medication she has tried is ranitidine which she took concurrently with omeprazole and she believes this helped. The patient denies undergoing an EGD within the last 10 years.

PAST HISTORY

Medical
Anxiety.

Surgical
Surgery as an infant for “twisted intestines.”

Procedures
Possible EGD in youth, but none in the last 10 years.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Works as a paralegal.

FAMILY HISTORY

Maternal grandmother with esophageal cancer.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

Omeprazole 40 mg twice daily.

ALLERGIES

Seasonal environmental allergies.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

• Constitutional Symptoms:  Positive for loss of appetite.
• Gastrointestinal: Negative for constipation, diarrhea, abdominal pain, difficulty swallowing, nausea, vomiting, blood in stools, unexplained change in bowel habits. Positive for heartburn.
• Psychiatric:  Positive for stress and anxiety.
• Allergic/Immunologic:  Positive for seasonal allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Gastrointestinal
There is a well-healed abdominal surgical scar.

ASSESSMENT

The patient presents today with a several year history of GERD that primarily manifests as heartburn and has been poorly controlled with omeprazole 40 mg twice daily. I suspect that she likely has GERD with underlying functional etiology as well. Reassuringly, she has no unintentional weight loss and denies any dysphagia. The patient has been able to identify triggers of her symptoms, including stress, spicy foods, carbonated beverages, citrus, and tomato-based foods.

• GERD
• Suspected underlying functional etiology of heartburn.

PLAN

• I recommended dietary and lifestyle modifications like cutting out her known trigger foods and trying to reduce her stress levels to help with her symptoms.
• I prescribed Nexium 40 mg twice daily to replace her current omeprazole 40 mg twice daily. I sent this prescription to her pharmacy.
• I also recommended she undergo an EGD. We discussed the potential risks of an endoscopic procedure. The patient understands the risks and is agreeable with the plan. She scheduled this procedure today.
• If her EGD is normal and her symptoms persist despite a trial of Nexium, we can consider a trial of Protonix and obtain a pH impedance study. This will allow us to rule out abnormal acid reflux exposure and to decipher between a functional etiology and hypersensitivity.
• The patient was counselled to call my office if anything changes or if she has any problems before her EGD or follow-up appointment.
• She will follow up with me in clinic after her EGD to discussed results and provide an update on the Nexium.

INSTRUCTIONS

• Avoid trigger foods and try to reduce stress levels.
• Stop omeprazole 40 mg twice daily and start Nexium 40 mg twice daily instead.
• Schedule EGD.
• Call with any changes or problems.
• Schedule a follow up visit after the EGD."
virtscribe,D2N182,"[doctor]  Next patient is Michelle King, date of birth, May 7, 1982. Please use Talk Template. She was admitted to District Regional Hospital on June 29, 2021, and was discharged on July 2, 2021. The patient is a 39-year-old female with history of quadriplegia due to a prior spinal cord injury. She was experiencing increasing concerns for spasms and lightheadedness, significant constipation, and reported diapheresis. She was evaluated in the emergency department where she was a febrile and had significantly elevated white blood cell count of 23,000. There were concerns for ongoing urinary tract infection, but she was treated with four antibiotic therapy. She had label blood pressure, headache, and vomiting. In the end, she slowly improved. She does have a superpubic catheter. Cultures were obtained and reviewed. She was eventually discharged after clinical improvement of her symptoms. She presents today to follow up regarding these concerns. Hi, Michelle. How are you doing?
[patient]  Not too bad in yourself.
[doctor]  I'm good. Thanks. So, it looks like you had an infection, right?
[patient]  Yeah, but you know, I really don't think it was a UTI.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  I told them when I went to the ears at your phone.
[doctor]  It is yeah. It listens to you and me and it does all of my documentation. It's pretty good stuff. Tell me what's going on.
[patient]  It is in my humble opinion that I was just constipated and that was what was causing my blood pressure to be so high. And I hardly poop when I was there. Then when I got home, I had a massive poop and I felt much better. I told them that when I was admitted and they did x-rays and everything, but they said no, as they didn't think that wasn't. That was it. But you know, I felt so much better when I got home and finally pooped.
[doctor]  Okay, and the white cell count was the only thing that I think they were kind of concerned about because it was a little high.
[patient]  So I wondered if automatic disreflexia can affect the white count.
[doctor]  Typically, it doesn't.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  But I mean when I looked at the urine cultures that they checked, the cultures are not very impressive.
[patient]  Yeah, that's what they said.
[doctor]  And when I go back and look, sometimes your white count is just elevated a little bit, and last year it was normal so.
[patient]  HM
[doctor]  but in saying that, you know, inflammation can do that. So, yeah, you could be backed up and inflamed.
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  They didn't do a cat scan. They just did an x-ray. But you feel like you're back to your normal self now?
[patient]  Yeah, I mean, I went in because I knew my blood pressure was out of control.
[doctor]  mhm..
[patient]  It was giving me a headache and making me throw up. And I know, at that point, I'm at the loss of what I can do at home.
[doctor]  Yeah, it was good that you went in.
[patient]  So I went in and they made me feel better and then I went home as you know.
[doctor]  Well, maybe that's all it was.
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  So you're doing good otherwise.
[patient]  Yes, I am.
[doctor]  Good. Let me take a quick listen to you.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  All right, go ahead and take a few deep breaths and breathe normally. Now take several deep breaths and two more. Okay, good. You can relax any pain or discomfort anywhere.
[patient]  Nope.
[doctor]  Great. So, here are my thoughts.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  You may recall it was extremely hot during that period leading up to you going to the hospital. I don't know if you were inside for the most part.
[patient]  Yeah, it was pretty hot wasn't it? And I go out a bit, but I do tend to stay in more when it's hot.
[doctor]  Okay, well if you do get dehydrated even just a little bit it can lead to further or worsening constipation issues.
[patient]  MM
[doctor]  I've had a lot of patients over the last couple of weeks coming in with just weird stuff, and I blamed that a little bit on how hot and humid it was the last two weeks of June. So what I would do is wait a couple of weeks, and then if you could come back in, and we could do some complete blood work, including your white blood cells, and a full panel of cholesterol since it's been a while.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  and it should normalize, but it's too soon to do it now. But maybe if I put some labs and you could come in in two to three weeks?
[patient]  Sure, I can do that.
[doctor]  Great! So that appointment will let us kill a bird. Two birds with one stone since you're due to get blood work anyways for cholesterol.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  And then I just wanted to make sure that the white count is okay because if it remains elevated then that means there's something else going on with your bowels.
[patient]  MM
[doctor]  I don't think that's what we'll find, but we'll see.
[patient]  I mean, I knew going in that I hadn't had a regular bowel movement in a while, even though I drink the mirror-lacks every day.
[doctor]  Yeah.
[patient]  Why don't go? I double up on that.
[doctor]  Have I ever given you lactilus? It would be a medicine you use in conjunction with mirrorlax, sort of a rescue type thing.
[patient]  Is that the stuff that comes in a bottle?
[doctor]  Yes.
[patient]  Then yes, I have it. It takes about two days to work and then it's a brutal two days.
[doctor]  Got it. Yeah, it can be a little rough, but it works.
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  Alright, so we have our plan. Any questions?
[patient]  Yeah, well I would like to talk to you about COVID if we can.
[doctor]  Sure. So where are you at when it comes to the vaccine?
[patient]  I am unvaccinated.
[doctor]  So, what are your concerns about the vaccine?
[patient]  Well, we don't know the side effects.
[doctor]  Correct, we don't.
[patient]  It's too soon to tell the side effects, and I'm hearing more and more reports of people getting what's now termed as vaccine injury.
[doctor]  Right.
[patient]  which I had never heard of before. I don't know if it's a new term or not, but my take on a whole thing is that I'm young and healthy enough to beat it. Even if my respiratory is limited, I also take a lot of vitamin C.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  I also take multivitamins and I'm closely monitored. So I guess I don't feel as though I really the vaccine.
[doctor]  Well, my thoughts are that you actually should be vaccinated. I think you are high risk. If you get COVID, it's not going to be good for you.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  And I think it's safe. I mean, I understand and hear you. All of these stories out there about this regarding the vaccine. But I've seen all the bad things that could happen from COVID. People have died in my practice and I don't disagree that if you got COVID you'd probably be okay.
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  But I would consider you as someone that would make me a little bit concerned. I have had healthy people die from COVID.
[patient]  MM
[doctor]  I've had some people get really, really sick from it. So personally, I believe that this vaccine is completely safe. I really think that.
[patient]  All of them.
[doctor]  Yeah, I do, I do. I think there are side effects from all vaccines, so you have to go back and think about it. Do you get flu shot every year?
[patient]  No, I don't.
[doctor]  Right, well, it's hard for me to convince you because you're making a consistent viewpoint.
[patient]  Well, I am open-minded to this.
[doctor]  To me, it's a lot of the stuff out there is fear, and most of us health providers have gotten the vaccine. We've seen what the virus can do. I also have gotten all of my kids vaccinated.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  So I'm not concerned about the side effects of this. I don't think it does anything. And we have vaccinated 50% of the country.
[patient]  MM
[doctor]  The ear is full of these vaccines.
[patient]  Understand.
[doctor]  So there are definitely potential side effects to the vaccine. I mean, there's guia bar and all these things that could happen from the vaccine, but they're just very rare. My thing for you is I'm not convinced that there's alternative stuff or even the treatment we have, like the monoclonal antibodies, that will give help, but it's just my opinion.
[patient]  Well, that's what I'm here for.
[doctor]  Yeah, right now the numbers are low. Even with the delta variant, when it starts mutating, it's actually good because it becomes more contagious but less deadly.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  So that's what's going to happen with COVID. That's what's M.O. most of the science supports, and this is how most pandemics end, is that the virus starts losing its potency.
[patient]  Sure.
[doctor]  But think about it. And if you have any more questions you can certainly let me know, okay?
[patient]  어때요?
[doctor]  Alright, anything else we can discuss today?
[patient]  Nope, I think I'm all set. Thank you.
[doctor]  You're welcome. So we'll see you in two to three weeks. Have a good rest of your day.
[patient]  Thanks you too!
[doctor]  Next line heading will be acute to chronic constipation. She believes her hospitalization was more likely due to her dysreflexia from her quadriplegia that typically occurs. She did have a lot of vital signs changes, including blood pressure fluctuations. The patient feels like she has a good bowel regimen, including taking the mirrorlax regularly as a primary treatment for constipation issues, as well as lactulose for severe constipation. She feels like this was less likely a true urinary tract infection and was just related to her constipation. However, we did have a good discussion regarding her leukocytosis.
[doctor]  I would recommend just in the next three or four weeks to come back in for some updated fasting labs, and we'll repeat the CBC just to make sure her white blood cells tend downward. Next line and heading will be quadriplegia. Next line and heading will be COVID vaccine status. Again, she's hesitant. We had a good discussion, and I recommended that the only true preventative mechanism for COVID is the vaccine. I do not believe that supplements are necessarily going to help stave this off. I would be concerned if she doesn't get the vaccine, and I would consider her at high risk based on her quadriplegia status. She does not want to get COVID, however, she needs to make these decisions. She is somewhat homeopathic.","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Transition of care visit.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Michelle King is a 39-year-old female who presents for a transition care visit. She was admitted to District Regional Hospital on 06/29/2021 and discharged on 07/02/2021.

The patient has a history quadriplegia from a prior spinal cord injury. She reported an increased concern for spasms, lightheadedness, headaches, significant constipation, and diaphoresis. Due to her uncontrolled blood pressure, headaches, and vomiting, she was evaluated in the emergency department. She was noted to be febrile, had a significantly elevated white blood cell count of 23,000, and labile blood pressure. Cultures were obtained and reviewed, with a urinary tract infection suspected. To note, the patient does require use of a suprapubic catheter. She was provided IV antibiotic therapy and was discharged after clinical improvement of her symptoms.

Today, the patient states she is feeling good and claims that she does not think she had an infection. Instead, she believes she was just constipated and that was the cause of her elevated blood pressure. She states she did not have a bowel movement in the hospital and when she got home, she had a large bowel movement and felt better. She states that she told the medical team in the emergency room that she was constipated, but they did not feel that was the causative agent, although they did complete x-rays and additional tests. The patient reports taking MiraLAX consistently for her constipation and Lactulose as needed, which takes 2 days produce a bowel movement.

The patient has not received the COVID-19 vaccinations because she does not know the side effects. She reports taking vitamin C and a multivitamin and she does not feel the need for the vaccine even though her “respiratory status is limited”. The patient also denies receiving the flu vaccine.

PAST HISTORY

Medical
Quadriplegia.
Spinal cord injury.
Hypertension.
Chronic constipation.
Automatic dysreflexia.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

MiraLAX as needed by mouth.
Lactulose as needed by mouth.

ASSESSMENT

• Acute to chronic constipation.
• Quadriplegia.

PLAN

Acute to chronic constipation
She believes that her hospitalization was more likely due to her constipation and dysreflexia from her quadriplegia. She had a lot of vital sign changes including blood pressure fluctuations. She feels like she has got a good bowel regimen. She does take MiraLAX consistently, and Lactulose for severe constipation. She feels like this was less likely a true urinary tract infection. However, we did have a good discussion regarding her leukocytosis. I would recommend in the next 3 or 4 weeks to come back in for some updated fasting labs and we will repeat the CBC and ensure that trends downwards.

COVID vaccine status
Again, she is hesitant. We had a good discussion. I recommend that the only real, true preventative mechanism for COVID is the vaccine. I do not believe that supplements are necessarily going to help stave this off. I would be concerned that she does not get vaccinated, I would consider her at high risk based on her quadriplegia status. She does not want to get COVID. However, she needs to make these decisions. She is somewhat homeopathic in some of her viewpoints.

At the last visit on March 3rd, 21 he was prescribed the following. Clinton, Mice and Locean, Trent, Tredenoin cream, four to 5% benzoil peroxide wash for F-face, and five to 10% for chest and back. So we're going to enter the room.

[patient]  I washed it with the binzule peroxide and I put the antibiotic thing and the sunscreen moisture stuff as well.
[doctor]  Perfect. Uh, what did you do last night?
[patient]  I watched my face with the benzal peroxide. I put the Tretrinoin cream. I think I... Sorry. I don't know how to say that for night time and the sunscreen moisture stuff again.
[doctor]  All right, all right. Now have you had any redness, peeling, dryness or irritation with the use of these medications at all?
[patient]  Nope. Not all.
[doctor]  Excellent, excellent. And uh, washing your chest and back with the higher strength benzoel peroxide wash. Is that right?
[patient]  Oh no, I didn't get it.
[doctor]  Okay. Um, are your chest and back doing okay?
[patient]  um... i mean i haven't put much effort into it because it hasn't really bothered me
[doctor]  Fair enough. That's all right. If it bothers you, that's what... That's why I recommended last time.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  So as we move into the summer, it may be something that you are more interested in pursuing doing that. But if you feel like the acne on your face, do you feel like the acne on your face is improving?
[patient]  Yeah, definitely.

Uh, I'm happy with how things are going. Are you, are you happy with how things are going?
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  Alright, yeah. If that little bit bothers you, I would use a 5-10% benzoil peroxide base. I think that what I have using on your face is a 4-5%. Usually the back and chest can handle a little, a little something stronger. That's the only thing I would think about changing, otherwise it thinks this looks great.
[patient]  Sounds good.
[doctor]  Alright, uh, do you have any questions for me?
[patient]  and don't you? I'm just going to write that down.
[doctor]  Uh, well you want me to write that down for you on your... uh, check out sheet?

virtscribe,D2N185,"[doctor]  Okay, next patient is Ashley James, date of birth December 27th 2006. Ashley is a 14-year-old female, uh, who is previously healthy. Now here for evaluation of abnormal renal ultrasound with an atrophic right kidney. Hi, good afternoon, Ashley. How are you doing?
[patient]  I'm doing okay. How are you?
[doctor]  I'm doing well. Thanks so much for asking. I'm Dr. Rogers. I'm one of your kidney doctors, and you guys must be mom and dad.
[patient]  Yes, that's correct.
[doctor]  Great. Well, all right. It's so nice to meet all of you. I wish it was under better circumstances, but we're going to figure it all out here today. Speaking of that, let's go ahead and review some of your past medical history, and then I'll complete an exam of her heart and lungs and kind of move from there. Would that be all right with you, Ashley?
[patient]  Yeah, that sounds good.
[doctor]  Okay, so as I understand it Ashley was found to have a small kind of a small kidney on one side. Tell me about when that was. I do also have records of everything but I just like to hear the story of how it was found out and what you're doing that got us here today.
[patient]  Sure. So Ashley came home one day sick out of nowhere, rubbing her stomach, and she said it was hurting on her right side. And it was so bad that she was bent over in pain.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  We automatically thought appendix.
[doctor]  Sure, that makes a lot of sense.
[patient]  We took her to her doctor. They treated her for a stomach virus. They get her fluids and sent her back home, and the next day she was twice as bad as the first day.
[doctor]  Goodness. Okay. Then what happened?
[patient]  Yeah. So I took her back again and they did more testing. I think they did an ultrasound or something, and that's where they found that one kidney was bigger.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  Um, then at that time they told us to follow up with our primary the next day, which we did. Um, but he was heading out on vacation, so he only saw her for a brief 10 minutes, and then we were out the door. So she was still throwing up, in a lot of pain, so I took work off to help her.
[doctor]  Wow. Okay.
[patient]  Uh, we took her down to Jacksonville, where they did see her and basically told us the same thing, that they didn't think one of her kidneys was working at all. They called it a trophic and that it was a lot smaller than the other one.
[doctor]  All right, why? Then, then what happened?
[patient]  Yeah. Then, um, they found cysts or something on her kidney and ovaries and maybe some other places. Her lymph nodes were swollen and they found some infection. Um, they told us to follow up with her doctor, which we figured since she was still sick.
[doctor]  Okay, and then when you follow it up with your doctor, what happened then?
[patient]  Yeah. It didn't seem to be getting any better within a day or two, so we followed back up with her doctor, who was, of course, still out of town with no one to see her in his place. So we ended up coming to Atlanta. We stayed here for about four days. Um, they did see her and treated her.
[doctor]  Okay. I am so sorry for all of that back and forth but glad to know that there was some light at the end of that tunnel.
[patient]  Thank you. And then after they saw her, she did seem to get a little better. She hasn't had any more throwing up or anything since, but she still complains about a lot of pain in her stomach.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  Yeah. And she mentions burning too, especially when she eats and stuff like that.
[doctor]  Alright, why? Okay. Well, that was a really good review. So, Ashley, before all of this, would you say that all in all, you were a pretty healthy child?
[patient]  She is, yeah. Before that, she was completely fine. Uh, they said they think at some point she had a severe infection that might have affected her kidney.
[doctor]  Got you. Okay.
[patient]  So one other thing, too, when she was four years old she was in the hospital three or four times, sometimes for three days at a time. I don't think they did any tests to see what the infection was or even where it was coming from. They just gave her fluids and antibiotic and they would send us home.
[doctor]  Hmm, okay.
[patient]  Yeah. And so a week or two later, she would have a fever and symptoms and basically the same thing. We went through that for a couple of months, and then it just stopped. So she had no problems since, but the doctor suspects that she's had kidney problems since then. So we just want to see if she's all right or if she, if it needs to be taken out maybe. We want to do whatever needs to be done.
[doctor]  Yes, absolutely. It sounds like this road has been very much so rough to navigate to, so we'll get you through for that. Um, is Ashley taking any medications daily right now?
[patient]  Only PEP said.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  Yeah. So she takes 40 milligrams of pepsidae and then also takes claritin for allergies.
[doctor]  All right, why? And any difficulties with your pregnancy with her or during delivery?
[patient]  No. Um, renal disease does run in my family, though. My dad, aunt, and my cousins all have issues with their kidneys. I have their paperwork right here for you with their diagnoses.
[doctor]  Great. I will definitely review that over. Any other family history to be aware of?
[patient]  Yes. My mom had breast cancer too.
[doctor]  Okay, great. Alright, why? So just stay over a quick review. It does look like your father had a kidney transplant. Is that correct?
[patient]  Yes, that is correct. He did.
[doctor]  Okay, so obstructive neuropathy. It sounds like he was born with it and something made it so he couldn't urinate correctly. Does that sound right?
[patient]  Yes, and they didn't catch it in time.
[doctor]  I'm so sorry to hear that.
[patient]  Yeah. He actually died at 47 of a massive heart attack.
[doctor]  My goodness. Wow. I am so sorry to hear that. But thank you so much for, you know, all of these bits and pieces really helped knit up a story together for Ashley so we can get her the best care.
[patient]  You're welcome.
[doctor]  Okay, so you said her aunt also has had kidney disease?
[patient]  Yes. Well, it was my dad's sister, so her great aunt.
[doctor]  Okay, and okay. I'm looking here. It looks like do you know what the name of diagnosis? It doesn't seem to be mentioned.
[patient]  Um, this is what she sent me, and stage renal disease. Chronic kidney disease stage 5, diabetes, hypertension, that's all I have, uh, to work on for her.
[doctor]  Okay, and that's okay. Let me see. That is all when she was an adult when all of that happened.
[patient]  Correct. Yep.
[doctor]  All right, why? Okay. And it also looks like Ashley has seen a GI and a geneticist where they didn't find anything sig clinically significant mutations on the panel that they did.
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  Okay, so that's all good. So, Ashley, a few questions for you if that's all right. How are you feeling right now?
[patient]  I'm not feeling too bad. My stomach just hurts just a little bit. It's burning a little bit.
[doctor]  Okay. And any pain when you go pee?
[patient]  Sometimes it's just hard to start, sometimes.
[doctor]  Okay. And any blood in your pee?
[patient]  No, not that I've noticed.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  She does complain that it burns when she peas when she drinks certain drinks, um, like soda. So she'll only drink gatorade or water.
[doctor]  Okay, yeah. So we do see that some people are very sensitive when the drink certain items, especially the carbonation. It can make it burn a little bit when they urinate. Okay, so a lot of different pictures of her kidneys here, and we'll review all of that here in a moment.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  All right, why? But before we review that, I want to look through a quick exam and just see how things are doing. You'll hear me speak aloud the exam just to make sure I'm getting everything documented.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  All right, why? Please use my physical exam template. So, Ashley, I'm going to listen to your lungs and heart if you'll just breathe normally for me. Okay?
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Good. Lungs and heart sound great. All right, why? So your physical exam, you know, everything we see up here is, you know, you're a well-appearing female, alert and oriented sitting comfortably on my chair today. I hope with not acute distress exam otherwise with norm within normal limits. Okay. So where does that all leave us? The good news is that her kidney functions do look good as, as does her blood pressure. We'll want to keep on eye on both of those things, as she is at a higher risk for developing high blood pressure and something that we call protenuria, which is where your kidneys don't work as well as they should, and we end up seeing protein in your pee.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  or excuse me her pee. Her right kidney is a little bit smaller which is making her left kidney work harder, possibly causing the left to appear bigger. And it's something that we want to keep an eye on but nothing for us to do with anything today.
[patient]  Okay. Thank you.
[doctor]  I also recommend that on an annual basis, we do kind of the following things. So I want to have an ultrasound to monitor the size of her kidneys and their overall function, complete a urinalysis to continue to make sure that protein and blood are not in her in her pee and do a blood pressure check. Additionally, let's avoid non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines like ibuprofen and optus Tylenol instead.
[patient]  Okay. That sounds good.
[doctor]  Okay, and does Ashley play any sports?
[patient]  Yes. She is active in softball and she wants to join the drill team over the summer.
[doctor]  How fun! I used to play softball back in the day. Um, so it'll be very important that during those activities, she stays well hydrated. I really want to avoid dehydration, as it puts tremendous strain on her kidneys. So, I'm going to recommend at least two liters per day of water.
[patient]  Okay. Great. We will work on that.
[doctor]  Okay, I also recommended a healthy diet and continue her active lifestyle. This will help keep her and her kidneys healthier as an adult. So if we can start those behaviors early, we'll be in a good space as she progresses.
[patient]  We can do that. We already do try to eat. Uh, very well.
[doctor]  Good, good. So for her next appointment, she can either meet with her primary care physician or an adult nephrologist closer to you guys at home. You don't have come all the way out here.
[patient]  Okay. That sounds great.
[doctor]  Okay, that was a lot. Do we need any additional questions clarified or anything? You can always give us or your primary a call if you think of anything or if, certainly, if symptoms worse.
[patient]  No. I don't have any additional questions, and I'll definitely give you a phone call if we do. And thank you so much. This was so helpful.
[doctor]  Awesome. Well, thank you guys for making the trip. And Ashley, it was really nice to meet you. Mom, dad, you as well. And I hope you guys take care.
[patient]  You too.
[doctor]  All right, why? Past medical history, Review of Patient's Grandfather's Record, we see he had posterior urethral bowel's valves and obstructive nor neuropathy. He developed chronic kidney disease and was on dial, was dialysis dependent. He had a renal transplant which subsequently failed, died of dialysis in his 40s. Wait, is that right?
[patient]  Now that you've started, it does. I don't understand the he and less they were giving, the grandfather's record. But did you want to do this on your own this recording?
[doctor]  Yeah, that's yeah, that'll work because I'm gonna have to drop for this. But I think we're good for everything else.
[patient]  and he did die in his 40s. That's what it said in the note earlier.
[doctor]  Okay, yeah, he died in his 40s, but I thought it was from a massive heart attack. Died at 47 of a massive heart.
[patient]  He died. It's saying that it meant it means he died on Jaya like he was he was um utilizing dialysis.
[doctor]  not because of it. Okay.
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  I see what you're saying.
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  Got it. Cool. I'm gonna stop.","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Evaluation of abnormal renal ultrasound with atrophic right kidney.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Next patient Ashley James is a 14-year-old female, previously healthy, who is here for evaluation of abnormal renal ultrasound with atrophic right kidney.

The father details a history of the patient coming home sick one day with extreme right-sided abdominal pain. Her parents brought her for evaluation, and they treated her for a stomach virus and administered fluids prior to sending her home. The next day, the patient's pain was more severe. The patient returned to the doctor's office and an ultrasound and additional testing was performed which revealed left kidney hypertrophy. At that time, they were encouraged to follow-up with her primary care physician. The patient was seen briefly by her physician the next day, which was insignificant. Ashley was still experiencing stomach pain and vomiting, her father brought her to another facility in Jacksonville. At that location, the patient's family received information that her right kidney was nonfunctioning, atrophic, and smaller than her left kidney. Additionally, cysts on her kidneys, ovaries, and other locations were found. Her lymph nodes were swollen, and she had ""a lot of infections"". The patient was sent back to follow-up with her primary care physician. The patient was unable to follow back up with her primary care physician as he was still out of town. The patient came to Atlanta, remained here for 4 days, was evaluated and treated with subsequent improvement of her symptoms. She has not vomited since.

Prior to her current medical complaints, the patient was healthy. The etiology of her kidney issues is believed to have been caused by some severe infection the patient experienced, possibly as a child.

When the patient was 4 years old, she was hospitalized 3 or 4 times, for up to 2-3 days each time. She received fluids and antibiotics, and then discharged. Her father reports that no workup was ever performed to rule out infections during these hospitalizations. A week or 2 post-discharge the fever and symptoms would return. This kept recurring for approximately 2 months and then it spontaneously resolved.

The patient is still experiencing some stomach burning. She reports hesitancy while urinating and she states she has to wait for her urinary flow to commence. She endorses occasional dysuria. Ashley denies hematuria. Some beverages are associated with dysuria, thus the patient drinks mainly water, Gatorade and V8 juice.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient plays on softball team and is interested in joining a drill team over the summer.

FAMILY HISTORY

Paternal Grandfather: Deceased approximately 47. Myocardial Infarction. Posterior Urethral Valves. Obstructive Neuropathy. End Stage Chronic Kidney Disease was Dialysis dependent. Failed Renal Transplant.
Paternal Great Aunt: End Stage Chronic Kidney Disease is Dialysis dependent. Type II Diabetes. Hypertension.

No family history of polycystic kidney disease.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

Pepcid 40 mg once daily.
Claritin as needed for allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Constitutional
Well-appearing female adolescent, sitting comfortably on the exam table in no acute distress.

Neurological
Alert.

RESULTS

Abdominal ultrasound, 03/22/2021.
CT abdomen and pelvis, 03/22/2021.
CMP, 03/22/2021.

ASSESSMENT

• Renal hypoplasia.
Ashley is a 14-year-old female who presents today for evaluation of abnormal renal ultrasound with atrophic right kidney. She has right-sided renal hypoplasia with a small atrophic right kidney discovered incidentally on imaging for abdominal pain. Imaging shows compensatory hypertrophy of her left kidney. Otherwise, she shows no sequelae of chronic kidney disease and enjoys normal blood pressure. Her urinalysis is without sediment. She has normal kidney function with creatinine of 0.62, which equates to an estimated GFR of greater than 90 mL/min per 1.73 m², and normal serum electrolytes and acid base status. Ashley is at higher risk of hypertension and proteinuria, which will need to be followed annually.

PLAN

Yearly ultrasound to monitor the hypertrophic left kidney and atrophic right kidney. Also, on an annual basis I recommend completion of a urinalysis to assess for proteinuria and blood pressure checks. The patient should avoid use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications and use Tylenol for pain and fever. It is also recommended that she stay well hydrated, avoiding dehydration, especially while participating in sports, by consuming 2 L of water per day. I counseled the patient and family about the importance of a healthy diet and remaining active to avoid future comorbidities that may put her at increased risk for chronic kidney disease as in adult.

The patient does not need to follow up with a pediatric nephrologist but can instead follow up with her primary care physician or an adult nephrologist closer to home.

INSTRUCTIONS

Schedule follow up appointment with local adult nephrologist or primary care physician."
aci,D2N186,"[doctor]  Hey Sean, nice to see you I heard you that you have some back pain.
[patient]  It's nice to see you too, it's been a while.
[doctor]  Yeah
[patient]  You know I had some back surgery and for some reason I always had lower.
[doctor]  Left back pain when was your back surgery.
[patient]  It was in November of 2020.
[doctor]  Was that long ago?
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  While it happened, what did they do? Micro-discectomy my disc broke off and just wrapped around and connected to my spinal the cal sac. Sounds horrible, it's not the poop sac though.
[patient]  That's good to know what kind of symptoms did you have with that horrible pain down my leg in my back. Just horrible, awful things that you could think of.
[doctor]  Horrible nerve pain it sounds like.
[patient]  I think so.
[doctor]  Okay, did they give you any meds for that they did I was highly, highly dosed up on gabapentin?
[patient]  Was that hard to withdraw from?
[doctor]  Yeah, it was terrible sounds like yeah. There is certainly take too much of that. And then stop suddenly, you can definitely have some some issues. Okay, so you have left side low back pain.
[patient]  MM
[doctor]  Does anything make it better or worse? So my beautiful, significant other always tells me to stretch, and it always works.
[patient]  She sounds smart.
[doctor]  Yes, she is so stretching helps okay. What about any physical activities? Do they make it worse?
[patient]  A lot of bending over.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  and
[doctor]  Honestly, it just happens.
[patient]  You know randomly.
[doctor]  Randomly, okay, so it hurt on the right side as well or just the left.
[patient]  depends on the day.
[doctor]  Is it right around where you had surgery?
[patient]  Generally.
[doctor]  Okay, did you try icing?
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  whom did you try any pain meds?
[patient]  Yep.
[doctor]  What kind of pain meds did you?
[patient]  I'd be profan 800 milligrams a day.
[doctor]  It's quite a high dose, okay. Let me do a quick physical exam on your back here if you bend forward, does that hurt?
[patient]  Not right now, but normally it would.
[doctor]  Okay, so no pain with flexion, how about if you stand back up?
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Okay, no pain with extension. Either does it hurt while you're just standing here.
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  Okay, so pain when you're weight-bearing does it hurt when I push right here on the left side?
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  Pain with palpation to the left side around the L5, how about on the right side?
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  No pain with palpation to the right side. Okay, I'm just going to push down on your feet. Can you push back up on my hands?
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  Alright, Dorsiflexion is normal looks like that you have normal range of motion, so that's good any pain down your legs.
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Great no nerve pain alright so we took an x-ray when you came in it looks like you don't have any fractures or anything on the spinal bone that's good you can see where you would surgery it looks like everything is healed properly there so that's good news so what I think you did is you have a a muscle pull there from having a misalignment in your spine so what I'm going to do is I'll prescribe some physical therapy for you you have great physical therapy here at the VA so you can just come right to our physical therapist and that should help have you have you been there before
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  How do you feel about it?
[patient]  I really go to the dentist.
[doctor]  Got it okay, so I'm also going to prescribe you some Meloxicam instead of the ibuprofen that might help a little bit more with some of the pain management.
[patient]  Is there any chance I can get some vikin?
[doctor]  Let me check your record quick for for pain management. It's kind of a strong drug for vikiden and we don't really like to prescribe that unless it's totally necessary. So why don't we start with the meloxic am? And I also write a referral to pain management and they can talk to you a little bit about some of your pain and maybe not using narcotics to manage it.
[patient]  How about some demoral?
[doctor]  I'm sure I'll prescribe Demarol.
[patient]  Thank you.
[doctor]  Yeah, you're welcome. Any other problems going on today, you want to talk about.
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Alright well it was nice to see you today.
[patient]  It's always nice to see you as well.
[doctor]  Alright.","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Low back pain, left side.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Sean Phillips is a pleasant 35-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of left-sided low back pain.

The patient has been experiencing pain in the left side of his low back, generally localized around the surgical site of his microdiscectomy performed in 11/2020, but occasionally into the right side as well. Other than spontaneous flare-ups, his pain is worsened with excessive spinal flexion. Stretching and ibuprofen 800 mg daily are helpful, but he denies having tried icing the area.

SURGICAL HISTORY

The patient is status post lumbar microdiscectomy performed in 11/2020.

MEDICATIONS

The patient reports that, prior to his microdiscectomy in 2020, he was taking high-dose gabapentin for severe nerve pain through his back and lower extremities. He is currently taking ibuprofen 800 mg daily.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports left-sided low back pain.

PHYSICAL EXAM

MSK: Examination of the lumbar spine: No pain with flexion or extension. Pain with weight-bearing. Pain with palpation on the left side around L5. No pain with palpation on the right side. Dorsiflexion is normal. Normal range of motion. No nerve pain in his lower extremities.

RESULTS

X-ray images of the lumbar spine were obtained and reviewed in office today. These reveal no evidence of fracture or other abnormalities in the spine or vertebrae. His previous surgical site is visible and appears to have healed properly.

ASSESSMENT

Low back pain, left side.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I believe his symptoms are related to a muscle strain due to spinal misalignment. I recommend that we treat the patient conservatively with formal physical therapy and meloxicam. The patient requested a prescription for Vicodin and Demerol. I explained that Vicodin is a strong medication for this issue and that I would need to refer him to pain management for that, but I did provide him with a prescription for Demerol."
aci,D2N187,"[doctor]  Well good morning Emily, how are you?
[patient]  Good morning.
[doctor]  How are you doing?
[patient]  Doing okay, I'm okay.
[doctor]  I understand you're having some sudden visual distortions and some blurring of your vision. Is that right?
[patient]  It is yes.
[doctor]  Okay, so what's going on?
[patient]  Sorry to put you off I don't think I have that script.
[doctor]  Oh
[patient]  Maybe a different one, I wonder if patient has history of.
[doctor]  Mackular degeneration. Yeah, yeah. I was because we don't we don't do the intro anymore. I was just going with that you're coming in with sudden visual distortion and blurring a vision. So I'll just you know, I'll just say I'll just go ahead and go into this technician part. So it looks like the technician notice that you've been having a decrease in vision when reading and straight lines and your door frames have been looking crooked to you is that right.
[patient]  It is yes.
[doctor]  Okay, what kind of venture are we going to go into do you have the script or know it it just talks?
[patient]  But it's not presenting like how you're reading it, like how you're talking about it. Is it kind of what I'm saying? Because after that I'm supposed to say, yeah, whenever I take my husband out to a nice restaurant, I have trouble adjusting to those dim lights. But I'm not really getting the question of like, so what's causing it, or do you have this happening stuff like that? So I'm a little confused.
[doctor]  Okay, I mean I can just straight out follow the script just so we can kind of get it rolling. So, so I said so high so it looks like the technician notice that you've been having a decrease in vision when reading and straight lines in your door frames have been looking crooked to you.
[patient]  Yeah, and whenever I take my husband out to a nice restaurant, I have trouble adjusting to those dim lights.
[doctor]  Okay, so do you have a favorite restaurant you like to go to?
[patient]  I do McDonald's is one of my favorite here in Arlington.
[doctor]  That sounds good. What what do you what's your favorite there?
[patient]  They have a great eggplant parmesan one my favorite. So I just go ahead and go with that.
[doctor]  That sounds really nice very good.
[patient]  It's just...
[doctor]  Yeah, okay. Well, so it looks like you're still smoking a pack of cigarettes a day.
[patient]  Yes, I try to stop smoking every now and then, but it's still been hard to totally stop.
[doctor]  Okay, and how is your blood pressure been doing? Are you keeping up with your medication?
[patient]  I take my blood pressure when I can remember to do so.
[doctor]  Okay, yeah, it's really important to keep up with your blood pressure check that regularly. I'm totally going off script and you know, might want to keep a log of that as well and check your blood pressures regularly. So, okay, well, let me do a just a quick exam of your eyes if you can take off your glasses and just rest your chin on the chin rest okay. So the anterior segment examination reveals posterior chamber interocular lenses in. Both eyes right eye the cornea is clear no-in-the-eye style cup to discus. Two funnest examination of the right eye shows the retina to be attached 360 degrees without any tears or holes or P changes in the phobia posterior segment exam shows drucin in the macular thickening of the retina presence of sub retinal fluid and exudates accumulation positive for hemorrhage left eye the cornea is clear no-in-the-eye cup to discus. Three or P changes in the phobia no-hemorrhage or sub retinal fluid retina is attached okay. So I reviewed the results of your diagnostic tests so for the oct. So it shows drucin deposit and the retinal pigment epithelium sub retinal fluid accumulation, coroidal neovascular membrane can be visualized fluorescine angiography reveals focal areas of leakage in the right eye consistent with neurovascular age related macular degeneration. So the diagnostic tests and the eye exam are really indicative of neovascular age related macular degeneration. So this is advanced to a stage that usually leads to more severe vision loss and it really happens when those abnormal blood vessels start to grow beneath the retina and they will leak fluid and blood and hence the name wet AMD and can create a large blind spot in the center of the visual field and this is really with the most common cause for severe loss of vision. So my plan is to give you an injection of Lucennies once a month it's injected into the the trees portion of the eye after it's been numbed and injections are given regularly over a period of time it may slow the rate of vision decline or stop further vision loss but however the disease and loss it may also progress despite treatment do you have any questions
[patient]  I do not know that sounds great.
[doctor]  Okay.","CHIEF COMPLAINT

I want to go ahead and prescribe some aloxicam 15 milligrams. Once a day, you should ice the area for about 20 minutes, five times a day and weight bear as tolerated I am anticipating you to start feeling better in the next couple of weeks if you're not come back here and see me and we will consider physical therapy or pursuing further imaging okay.

[patient]  Correct, yes, right-handed.
[doctor]  Okay, alright, and any shortness of breath when you walk around or move anything like that.
[patient]  Yeah, I would say, you know, I've been trying to keep my mind. I'm not doing a lot of exercise, but I will say that when I go up and downstairs, you know, I do feel like I have shortness of breath.
[doctor]  Okay, now I know they put you on that medication the Berlinta. Are you you're taking it correct?
[patient]  Yes, I take it twice a day every 12 hours.
[doctor]  Okay great, and you're still taking your aspirin correct.
[patient]  I take the baby aspirin at night. Is that okay?
[doctor]  Yeah, that's perfect as long as you take it once a day, and you're able to afford the bralinta any issues with costs with that.
[patient]  Now I so far so good.
[doctor]  Okay, all right, so it's really going to be really important for you to go ahead and continue to take these medications to prevent that stent from clogging again. Okay, or prevent that stent from closing because we don't want you to have another heart attack. Okay.
[patient]  Okay, yeah.
[doctor]  Okay, and how about watching your diet? Are you able to watch your salt intake? I know that you really like to good pizza every now and again are you?
[patient]  Yeah, I have eaten pizza a few times what I'm trying to do is really be diligent and eat well throughout the week. And then I have had pizza a few times on the weekends is that okay.
[doctor]  You can have a piece here, and there you know the pumping function of your heart was pretty normal when I saw from the hospital your rejection fraction that's the pumping function of your heart was at about 50% which is you know low normal but not bad so that's good so okay just I would just watch your salt intake okay
[patient]  Okay, yeah, I've been eating a lot of vegetables and chicken without salt on it.
[doctor]  Okay great, and then you know I am I'm glad that you're taking it easy now remind me this might cause you some anxiety Were the Denver Denver Nuggets swept or did they end up winning? Are they still in the NBA playoffs? I forget I know that you are a Denver Nuggets fan
[patient]  I am yeah, they're not sweep they were down three games, but they wanted the last one. So there's a chance for it come back, but they play again tomorrow.
[doctor]  Okay, yeah, I'm a self-expand and we just swept the Brooklyn net. So I was really excited about that.
[patient]  Congrats that that's always good to sweep the nuts no one no one likes them.
[doctor]  No one likes them. Okay. Well, let's I want to just go ahead and do a quick physical exam. I'm just going to be calling out some of my exam findings and I'll let you know what that means when I'm done. Okay. So looking at your blood pressure here in the office, your blood pressure looks good. It's about 127 over 60, which is pretty good on your neck exam. I don't appreciate any jugular venous distension. There is no carotid roots on your heart exam. I do appreciate a slight three out of six systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base on your lung exam. Your lungs are nice and clear to osculation bilaterally. And on your musculoskeletal exam, your right radial artery cardiac cathocyte is clean dry. And intact, there is no hematoma and there is a palpable radial pulse. Now, what does that mean? Betty, so all of that means is that you know you have a little bit of a heart murmur after having the heart attack, but I looked on the echocardiogram and it showed that you know you do have mild. My troll regurgitation, which is just, you know, a little floppy valve, which is as fine. We'll just keep an eye on that. And then everything else for the most part looks good. So let's just talk a little bit about my assessment and plan. Okay. So for your first problem of your inferior myocardial myocardial infarction, I want to go ahead and continue with your aspirin, continue on your brilinta. You're going to stay on the brilinta for at least one year and aspirin, you're going to take lifelong until I tell you to. Okay, I want to go ahead and have you continue on the crestor 40 milligrams once a day. And I'm going to go ahead and put in another echocardiogram for about six months. Okay, do you have any questions about that?
[patient]  Did you think I can know that sounds good I have one of the more questions though?
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  Do you think that I can swim again? I'm Miss Swimming.
[doctor]  Yes, so at this point you know you're out like two weeks and your end-your-cathed side is looks good, so you can go ahead and then resume swimming now with that being said, I would want you to just do a few laps here. And there I do want to enroll you into cardiac rehab that's going to give you a bit more confidence to go back to exercising. And they also give a lot of dietary education and counseling in cardiac rehab. Does that sounds like something that you can do?
[patient]  Yeah, I think I have to.
[doctor]  Okay, I agree. Alright, I also want you to go ahead and continue with your Toprol 50 milligrams once a day. And I'm going to go ahead and order some liver function studies and a lipid panel to follow up with the next time we meet. And I want to see you again in probably six weeks. Okay.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Okay, any questions?
[patient]  No, I think that's it. Thank you very much.
[doctor]  Okay, take care, bye.","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Follow up.

MEDICAL HISTORY

Patient reports an myocardial infarction.

SURGICAL HISTORY

Patient reports stent placement in the right coronary artery.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient is a fan of the Denver Nuggets basketball team. He also enjoys swimming.

MEDICATIONS

Patient reports taking Brilinta twice a day every 12 hours, aspirin 81 mg at night, Crestor 40 mg once a day, and Toprol 50 mg once a day.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Cardiovascular: Denies chest pain.
Respiratory: Reports shortness of breath with exertion.
Skin: Denies redness or infection in the right wrist.

VITALS

Blood Pressure: 127/60.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Neck
- General Examination: No jugular venous distention. No carotid bruits.

Respiratory
- Auscultation of Lungs: Clear bilaterally.

Cardiovascular
- Auscultation of Heart: Slight 3/6 systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base. No gallops or rubs.

Musculoskeletal
- Examination: Right radial artery cardiac catheterization site is clean, dry, and intact. No hematoma. Palpable radial pulse.

RESULTS

The ejection fraction, obtained while he was hospitalized, was measured at approximately 50%, which is in the low normal range.

I reviewed the patient’s recent echocardiogram which demonstrates mild mitral regurgitation.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Inferior myocardial infarction.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient is doing well. His catheterization site is healing well.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I explained the importance of continuing to take his medications to prevent the stent from clogging again and to reduce his chance of another heart attack. I encouraged him to limit his salt intake as an increased amount of sodium can affect the ejection fraction measurement of his heart function.
- Medical Treatment: The patient is taking a low-dose aspirin, and will continue taking it for life or until he is instructed to discontinue. Continue Brilinta for at least 1 year. Continue Crestor 40 mg once a day. Continue Toprol 50 mg once a day. The patient can resume swimming a few laps. He will enroll in cardiac rehab to gain confidence in returning to exercising and for dietary education and counseling. Liver function studies and lipid panel ordered. Repeat echocardiogram ordered to be performed in 6 months.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me in 6 weeks to review his studies.

aci,D2N190,"[patient]  and good morning high Beverly.
[doctor]  Good morning.
[patient]  How do you see your last name?
[doctor]  Howard

[doctor]  Well, I think I like fell off of my tandem bike with my partner and my knee has been hurting ever since and when did that happen?
[patient]  Maybe like two weeks ago.
[doctor]  Okay, and which knee are we talking about?
[patient]  My right knee.
[doctor]  All right, and tell me exactly what happened. So we were like riding together. And I think he said he saw a squirrel or something like that he's a little distractable. And you know, like he went down. So I went down. I hit it on the curb. Like it's really kind of was sore. I gave I took some ibuprofen. And I like washed it out and put a bandaid on it. But it's just been like kind of hurting every day since then. So I scheduled an appointment.
[patient]  Okay, is it getting better, getting worse, or just kind of lingering on?
[doctor]  It's just holding on and I tried taking medication, right? I took some ibuprofen and it was fine. It just like it keeps coming back and I read on the label, I'm not supposed to take that stuff for more than two weeks, right?
[patient]  Well at all, it all depends, everyone's different will get to that.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  And Yni was not bothering you at all before this normal name.
[doctor]  YEP!
[patient]  Never okay. Alright, what do you do for living?
[doctor]  Well, I work in a children's hospital, so I like play around, I'm I'm I'm a baby rocker professionally. I go into like the nick use and I I rock some of the babies.
[patient]  Gotcha, what do you do outside of outside of work? Is biking kind of your thing.
[doctor]  No, that was his thing, and I think that's why we fell I shouldn't trust him, but most of the time I go on walks with my dog.
[patient]  Okay, have you broke up with them already or?
[doctor]  No, I didn't know that Ne'Injury was a reason too, but now that you've told me, maybe we should talk about that.
[patient]  We'll talk about that later too.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  Alright, so let's take a peek at your knee here.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  You're going to stick it through the screen or how you're going to do this alright.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  Alright then.
[doctor]  I'm just going to grab your leg, we're just going to take it through, just let it relax. I'm just going to take it through a little range of motion. I'm going to kind of poke around all different places you tell me where it hurts okay.
[patient]  Okay, okay.
[doctor]  Alright now I'm poking, I'm poking, I'm poking so on the inside part here.
[patient]  Is this where hurts?
[doctor]  Yell like when you touch it, it really hurts.
[patient]  Right there ok, tell me what's worse here or here.
[doctor]  on the inside.
[patient]  Okay, so medial joint line tenderness.
[doctor]  Hm.
[patient]  PS Berza, Nontender, Epicondyle, Nontender back of our knee nice and softening pain back here.
[doctor]  No, I don't think so.
[patient]  Okay, POP-LITTIAL SPACE is nontender how about over on this side.
[doctor]  No, okay, lateral side nontender skin. She has got about a dime size little abrasions. Dry looks about a week week old right over the medial patella. Everything else looks good. No scars, okay. How about can you straighten it out all the way? I can, but sometimes it like hurts a little bit like it almost like it clicks.
[patient]  Yep, that's good though, full full extension. How far can you bend it?
[doctor]  all the way back.
[patient]  Okay, let's see.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  Good good and how about the other side? Let me see the left knee. Can you bend that one all the way back to?
[doctor]  Yeah, that's fine.
[patient]  Okay, full full symmetric flexion, no no deformities go ahead and just let it relax.
[doctor]  M.M.H.H. Valgus stress medial collateral ligament and tactile lateral collateral ligament and tactile okay. So a little kind of little laxity posterior drawer let me see the other let me see the other knee.
[patient]  and mememia so that that feels pretty much normal. So she's got about a 1 plus posterior drawer anterior drawer negative lockman, negative good. Let's go ahead and just kind of band and straighten for me.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  Good patella patella tracks, fine, no crepidus. All right, let's go back to this medial side or tender right there. Is that right?
[doctor]  Yeah
[patient]  It's tender on a medial joint line, but actually negative, McMurray negative lateral side, negative, McMurray good. So pretty stable, you feel like you're kind of shifting back a little bit on this side compared to the other side. Does it feel unstable when you walk? Does it feel like it shifts?
[doctor]  Yes, sometimes.
[patient]  What's the worst thing that you can do that you don't like about that knee? Is it walking, standing, sitting, still getting up from a chair in, and out of the car? What would you like?
[doctor]  Walking up a hill like any kind of incline really hurts.
[patient]  Yeah, and you're just a weak, or is it?
[doctor]  Hmm.
[patient]  You actually know.
[doctor]  Yeah, it hurts no.
[patient]  What about you? I mean, are you real weak?
[doctor]  No, I would say I'm pretty strong.
[patient]  Did you go to gym?
[doctor]  I go to the gym, but I swim so the...
[patient]  Okay, I can't treat people like you, you, you, you need to work harder. I quit complaining, okay.
[doctor]  Yes sir work harder okay.
[patient]  D.D. play sports in college or high school.
[doctor]  I didn't high school.
[patient]  Yeah, so in you and you still doing anything athletic now other than just rocking kids.
[doctor]  No.
[patient]  Just kind of thinking walking the dog.
[doctor]  Yerocking kids and walking dogs and going on the occasional swim.
[patient]  on the occasional swim. All right, how have you been swimming since you hurt your knee?
[doctor]  No, no, I haven't would you recommend that.
[patient]  While I'm not sure yet, it's because we might have to do surgery on your knee here and take that leg off.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  It's pretty bad.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  We'll get to that too.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  So did you already have x-rays of this knee today?
[doctor]  Yes.
[patient]  Okay, do I go into that too?
[doctor]  Yeah
[patient]  Look at the x-rays, do you? Or just stop here, you can okay. Okay. And so, what would happen now, you would you could pause it.
[patient]  You're only cup of this.
[doctor]  Let's take a look at your pictures here. And all right, so this looks pretty just looking at it. Looks pretty normal, looks pretty healthy. You can see how I all the edges of the bones here look pretty good. I don't see any bone spurs of that. I don't see anything broken. Everything looks pretty good kneecaps tracking good. You can see the space here. There's no real space there. That's actually cartilage. So that looks pretty healthy. And you can see the other side looks. Both both look the same. So X. Raise look, I don't see anything obvious on that. But looking at your knee here, you may have hit that tibia bone and kind of push that bone back. It feels to me like you may very well have sprained your or injured your posterior, cruciate ligament. That's what it's feeling like.
[patient] 
[doctor]  I'm not going to know that for sure, or if there's other things going on in there, but I think getting an MRI scan to look at what you may have done inside there, I'm pretty suspicious, though, that you may have injured that ligament. If that's the only thing you did very rarely, is this going to need surgery? Okay, so this may be something we want to get you into a brace here, get you into some therapy, and get all your motion back, and get your strength back. And then maybe check it back in a few weeks, and see because a lot of times those ligaments can tighten back up.
[patient]  It's its odd fur, just an isolated posterior ligament to need surgery.
[doctor]  Okay. Yes. Excuse me...
[patient]  But if there's other things going on, I can't tell you for sure that you didn't injure a maniscus too, or maybe chip some cartilage when that bone shifted. So let's get an MRI scan to look at that. If that comes back with just a ligament, like I'm suspecting, hopefully this is something we could treat with some therapy and some bracing for a while and get this thing back to normal if after that couple months later, or so you still have instability and still bothering you, then it's possible we may have to do some surgery to fix that ligament.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  Does that make sense?
[doctor]  Yeah, yeah, so in meantime though, do you want me to still keep taking the ibuprofenia? I think that's fine for short if it's helping the big thing right now, as we want to get your strength back and your motion back get rid of the swelling that we still see here.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  So that will help with that ice ice packs a few times a day. You can take the ibuprofen up to three times a day. And I'll look all we'll look at the dose here. There are some other medicines we can try that maybe don't have to take so often that may be easier.
[patient]  MM
[doctor]  So I can even send in a prescription for you, for something that maybe just twice a day a little easier for you to take without skipping doses.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Okay, you can just take it with breakfast and dinner.
[patient]  MM
[doctor]  We'll try and see if it works better if your IB Profen works better though go ahead and just go back to that but we can try this other prescription first.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  It's not very expensive and I can just call it into your pharmacy.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  And then we can get the brace fitted to you today. We are not going to look at a big big custom kind of expensive brace. We will just put because it may just be temporary.
[patient]  MMM
[doctor]  And then I will get you a referral to physical therapy, something that you can do close to home or close to work.
[patient]  And then maybe I could see you back here in maybe four to six weeks and recheck this.
[doctor]  Okay, how often am I going to have to go to physical therapy?
[patient]  I'm going to kind of leave that up to you in the therapist I would start with a couple visits. And then we'll just really see how you progress and what you could do at home if what if you have access to some equipment or things that we need to do. But I want you to go you know at least a few times so somebody can kind of keep an eye on you make sure you're doing the exercises right.
[doctor]  Okay, alright, I think that sounds good.
[patient]  Did you get that you select you last night?
[doctor]  I did.
[patient]  Yeah, what do you think? What do you roof for?
[doctor]  I so I am a little heartbroken right now I was for the rockets and the way that these nets are crushing them. It's just it's just painful.
[patient]  Are you serious?
[doctor]  Yeah
[patient]  Rockets!
[doctor]  I live in Dallas, yes.
[patient]  Yeah, yeah, that's not that's not my problem that you have not even watched the balls.
[doctor]  No, no.
[patient]  My gosh, all right, we're gonna have to work on you.
[doctor]  Okay, thanks.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Bye.
[patient]  You got four to six weeks to get your attitude straight. We'll talk about this later, okay?
[doctor]  Yes sir.
[patient]  Alright, very good. Any questions at all.
[doctor]  No.
[patient]  Okay, so","HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Beverly Howard is a pleasant 33-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right knee pain.

The patient reports that she fell off of a tandem bicycle and struck her right knee on a curb approximately 2 weeks ago. After the injury, she took ibuprofen and treated the wound, but the pain has persisted. She localizes her pain to the medial aspect of the knee. She also reports occasional clicking with full extension of the knee, as well as occasional instability with ambulation. The patient states that her pain is the worst when ambulating up an incline. She denies any previous right knee issues. She enjoys walking her dogs and swimming but has not done this since her injury.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient works in a Children's Hospital.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports right knee pain, clicking, and instability.

PHYSICAL EXAM

SKIN: Warm, dry and intact
MSK: 
Examination of the right knee: Tenderness along the medial joint line. Pes bursa is nontender. The epicondyle and posterior aspect of her knee are soft. Popliteal space is nontender. The lateral aspect of her knee is nontender. There is a dime-sized abrasion that is dry and appears to be 1 week old, over the medial patella. No scars. Full extension. Full symmetric flexion. No deformity. Valgus stress of the medial and lateral collateral ligament are intact. Laxity with posterior drawer testing. 1+ posterior drawer test. Negative Lachman test. Patella tracks fine. No crepitus. Negative McMurray test.
Examination of the left knee: Full symmetric flexion. No deformity. Valgus stress of the medial collateral ligament is intact. Lateral collateral ligament is intact.

RESULTS

4 views of the right knee were taken. These reveal no evidence of any fractures or dislocations. Joint space is well preserved. No other abnormalities are noted.

ASSESSMENT

Right knee pain, possible posterior cruciate ligament sprain.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, we had a lengthy discussion in regard to her current symptoms. I explained that her x-rays did not reveal any signs of a fracture. I recommend we obtain an MRI of the right knee to evaluate for a possible posterior cruciate ligament injury. In the meantime, I have recommended that the patient be placed in a brace to provide increased support. I have also recommended that the patient attend formal physical therapy to work on her range of motion and strengthening. I advised her to ice her right knee a few times a day to reduce the swelling. She can continue taking her ibuprofen if she finds this helpful, but I am also going to send in a prescription medication she can take less frequently. The patient will follow up with me in 4 to 6 weeks to check on her progress.

aci,D2N191,"[doctor]  So, hi Zachary, good to see you today. So, I'm looking at my notes. I see you coming in with some right elbow pain. And you also have a past medical history of hypertension diabetes. We're going to check on those. So, can you tell me what happened to your elbow?
[patient]  I just woke up one day, it was hurting.
[doctor]  It was hurting okay how long ago would you say that was?
[patient]  Since...
[doctor]  Since yesterday, alright.
[patient]  It's actually my left elbow, my left arm.
[doctor]  Okay, they must have written that down wrong. So it is your left arm. Are you right-handed or left-handed?
[patient]  Right-handed.
[doctor]  Okay, so do you think you might have slept on it wrong or anything like that or what?
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  So what part of your elbow would you say hurts?
[patient]  from my elbow all the way up to the to the neck.
[doctor]  Elbow up to the neck. All right. Is it your entire elbow or or would you say a individual part of it is painful?
[patient]  Just from the elbow up to the neck all the way up the arm.
[doctor]  All the way up the arm alright.
[patient]  or all the way down the arm to the elbow.
[doctor]  Okay, and what would you describe the pain as is it like a stabbing pain? Is it numb what's going on?
[patient]  kind of a archinist, archinist heaviness.
[doctor]  Autiness. Okay, did you do anything yesterday that you think might have caused the pain?
[patient]  Just a usual day of working around the house.
[doctor]  Okay, do you remember? I know sometimes, dude, chores you end up lifting heavy things do you remember doing that?
[patient]  No, no, nothing, nothing really unusual, you know, mode grass, and that's about it.
[doctor]  Okay, all right, have you taken anything for the pain yet?
[patient]  Some motoring.
[doctor]  Okay, and would you say that worked for you?
[patient]  Not really still kind of comes and goes and aches.
[doctor]  Okay, all right. So we'll take a look at your arm there because it's like your entire left arm up from your shoulder to your elbow does hurt in a second. We'll do an exam of that. So I see you're also coming and we're going to check on your hypertension and you came in today. Your blood pressure is a little bit high. It was 150 over 90. I don't think we talked last time about us getting you a blood pressure cuff. So you could take those and keep track and and and and let us know so what. Have your blood pressures been running lately?
[patient]  125 over 72.
[doctor]  Okay, that's not.
[patient]  Average.
[doctor]  That's not too bad. You might have a little white coat syndrome you see me today because it's a little bit high today so you're on that too. Five of Norvask have you been taking that?
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  Okay, that's good how about your diet. How is that going I know you were having a little trouble before your sod intake was a little bit high?
[patient]  I think I'm doing okay so.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  I'm doing okay.
[doctor]  Alright so as far as your diabetes your last time you came and let's say look at your A1c result, it was a 7. Two were on the 500 of metformin, so what have your blood sugars been running?
[patient]  I don't really check them.
[doctor]  You don't check them, okay? So yeah, we can get a glucose test today. And just check those because that's something we want to do every day, you know, just to make sure you're eating the correct amount and that your sugars are in range to make sure that. And also to make sure that our medication is the right amount as well. So we'll do that that glucose test at the end of your visit. And we could see if we can adjust your medication or not. So let's go ahead and do a physical exam on you. So I just want to double check, make sure you're having any chest pain.
[patient]  Yeah, hey on and off. So it kind of comes with the elbow pain arm pain.
[doctor]  Okay, comes with elbow pain, arm pain.
[patient]  Chest pain.
[doctor]  chest pain
[patient]  It kinda goes up my neck sometimes too.
[doctor]  Up your neck alright.
[patient]  Yet that whole side it just takes comes and goes.
[doctor]  Comes and goes all right how often is that chest pain happening to you? You said it's not constant.
[patient]  It just started yesterday.
[doctor]  Okay, so every hour, every 15 minutes, would you say?
[patient]  I don't know, mostly I had to stop mowing grass the other day, it bothered me a little bit. But other than that, it just kinda comes and goes, I guess, a few times a day.
[doctor]  Okay, all right, have you had any shortness of breath?
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  No, okay, just the chest pain alright.
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  So I'm going to listen to your heart here and it does seem like I do hear a slight murmur with your heart here and I don't think we've heard that before so I think I'm going to get an EKG as well because I'm concerned you might be having like a mild heart attack. So because you have the pain all the way up your elbow that go into your neck and your chest pain as well I don't think it's its musculoskeletal pain because you said you hadn't. Done anything with it so far so what I want to do is and let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan here. So I do think that you or you do have that chest pain I'm concerned that you know you might be having a mild heart attack. I'm going to get EKG for that we're also going to get you some aspirin as a nitroglycerin just to see if that helps with that pain as far as your for your diabetes. I want you we're going to get that p-oct glucose and we'll keep you on B5. 100 of metformin for now and then for your hypertension wheel. Keep you on that too. 5 of a norbask but I think our most immediate issue is the is the chest pain and so we'll do the EKG and depending upon those results we'll call 911 because we really need to get you to the hospital if that is the case. So how does that sound?
[patient]  I don't know, I was talking to my brother and he is a hard doctor and he kind of thought maybe it wasn't the heart but.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  he thought maybe i had he thought maybe i had something joby had you know they took joby to the hospital
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  So you heard you heard that did you.
[doctor]  I didn't hear about that no.
[patient]  Yeah, he-he-he-he-he couldn't stop there.
[doctor]  Okay, could stop doing what?
[patient]  You can start pooping.
[doctor]  No, while yeah, I didn't hear about Joe biting and and his is not ability his ability did not stop pooping probably had a diarrhea I'm not sure I didn't hear about that but most of the time
[patient]  No, it could have stopped pooping rushing.
[doctor]  Could not poop and you said pooping.
[patient]  Y'know!
[doctor]  It couldn't stop pooping yet. I mean that that might cause like anxiety or something like that. You know, we can't stop putting he's, he's in charge of my United States. But right now I'm, I'm really, you know, me. I'm concerned about your heart. So I do want to get the EKG just to make sure you know it'll be wouldn't be good.

aci,D2N192,"[doctor]  Karen is a 34-year-old female with a history of chronic migraines and hypertension who is here today with abdominal pain. So, hi there, Karen. It's nice to see you again. Listen, I'm sorry you're not feeling well. And you've got abdominal pain like to talk about that in some detail with you. But, hey, I want to use this new cool app that's going to help me focus on you a bit more in this visit wood that be okay with you.
[patient]  Sure that's fine.
[doctor]  Okay, great. So, so, Karen, tell me about your dominole pain? What's been happening?
[patient]  Well it started about 10 days ago with just some mild discomfort on my right side. And it seems to be getting worse over the last couple of days especially.
[doctor]  Okay, and how bad would you say the pain? It's like it's a zero to ten on a scale today.
[patient]  Yeah, it waxes and wanes and severity. It's in general probably around a 4 or 5. But sometimes it gets up as high as a 7 or 8.
[doctor]  Okay, is there anything that you notice that makes that pain worse or better like rest or movement or eating or anything else?
[patient]  It's usually a little worse after a meal.
[doctor]  I'm okay.
[patient]  And a morning before I've eaten, it's not too bad, but during the day after a meal it gets worse.
[doctor]  Okay, all right. And do you notice that pain radiates anywhere or moves you know any or anywhere?
[patient]  It's pretty low, it might radiate a little bit to the left, but otherwise it's pretty localized to the right side.
[doctor]  Okay, and have you had any nausea or vomiting along with the pain?
[patient]  I've had some nausea and a little bit of heartburn, but no vomiting.
[doctor]  Okay, and this is this is this is worse with you said worse worse with meals and is there anything else anything else that that makes it worse
[patient]  It is a little tender if I press on it, and certain positions seem to make it a little worse when I'm most when it's the highest.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  Pain.
[doctor]  Okay, sure any pain with urination or any blood in your urine.
[patient]  No no urinary symptoms.
[doctor]  Okay, and how about any diarrhea and any of that or blood in your stool now?
[patient]  No change in bowels.
[doctor]  Okay, alright, and so would you say that your appetite has been normal or decreased or any different?
[patient]  Well, since I'm a little nauseated, I'm not quite as hungry, and I feel just kind of a little overall, a little more fatigued over the last week.
[doctor]  Okay, okay, you didn't overeat, you know, during the Super Bowl last weekend. Did you that was I know probably lots of junk food floating around, if your house is anything like mine?
[patient]  Well, once the packers are out of the playoffs, I don't watch the Super Bowl, so nothing I haven't eaten anything unusual.
[doctor]  Okay, well that's good, that's good. And no no travel. I know you're a big big travel travel fan. You know, I remember you telling me about your trip to Europe last summer that sounded amazing have you been traveling outside of the country again recently.
[patient]  not recently just back to Wisconsin, but no unusual travel or other exposures.
[doctor]  Okay, all right, great. And okay, so tell me about your migraines, how have they been? Are you still taking the Sumatriptin you know as needed? When when you develop migraine, you have had a migraine recently.
[patient]  I have not usually their responsive to just accept a migraine. I use the Sumatriptin when I need to if it doesn't respond to the over-the-counter analgesic.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  So
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  It's been a day of pretty rare.
[doctor]  Okay, okay, great, yeah, you've learned a lot about it. And the treatments, including the terminal gzic, and all of that, that's pretty impressive you've been through the ringer, I think, with those so okay. And so you're taking accedrine when you get a migraine. And then sort of what you say, maybe for breakthrough migraines or worse migraines, you take a sumatriptin occasionally.
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  Okay got it and how about your blood pressure? How has that been running at home? Are you checking your blood pressures daily still? And how how how have your blood pressures been?
[patient]  I've not been checking them daily. I probably check it about two or three times a week.
[doctor]  Hmm.
[patient]  And a pretty good the upper number is usually around in the 120s or low 130s and the lower number, usually in the 70s.
[doctor]  Okay, okay, not too bad. It does look like you're a little bit elevated today. I may be I'm just making you nervous though, so I hope not so are you. But you're still on my CineProl 20 milligrams per day. Correct? It looks like you might be running low. Do you need a refill of that?
[patient]  Yeah, actually, I was going to ask you about that if I could get a refill, that would be great.
[doctor]  Sure we can do that, and so okay, but you are still taking that 20 milligrams per day correct.
[patient]  Correct.
[doctor]  Okay, and all right, fair enough. So, so let's go ahead and end examine you now, Karen, so on your physical exam, pretty normal and unremarkable for the most part on your on your heart exam. I do hear that grade three out of six histolic ejection murmur that you've still got that's unchanged from prior exam, that just means I hear some heart sounds you know as I'm listening to your heart there, I'm not too concerned about that, we'll watch that. Otherwise, normal cardiovascular exam and then you're your abdominal exam, gastrointestinal exam. You have some tenderness in the right upper quadrant, I would say mild to moderate tenderness and now if you take a deep breath, does that and I press here, does that hurt you?
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  Okay, yeah, you have, I would call an equivocal Murphy's sign in the right upper quadrant on your abdominal examination as well the rest of your abdomen is soft and no significant tenderness. You have no tenderness in the right lower quadrant with deep palpation and you have no CVA tenderness on your back exam as well. And so we will talk about about that I am a little bit concerned about the tenderness that I find on your abdominal exam, the remainder of your exam Karen is pretty normal and unremarkable. And so that's good. Let's talk about my assessment and your plan. So first of all for your first problem of abdominal pain you do seem to have acute abdominal pain with right upper quadrant tenderness that I'm concerned maybe a sign of some gallstones or possibly even an infection in your gallbladder. So I'm going to order some blood tests and an ultrasound today. I'm going to order a CBC Chem 12 your analysis of pregnancy test and also right upper quadrant ultrasound. And so we will get those tests done right away. I'm going to keep you here. We'll see how those look fortunately we've got the facilities for those. And if we need to send you to the emergency department based on those results we will I don't want you to eat anything right now. Okay. In case we find something that might require surgery, all right unlikely. But it's possible. And then okay, you know Karen I meant to ask you on your history one thing by chance. Have you had a fever along with this abdominal pain?
[patient]  I've had some chills, but no documented fevers.
[doctor]  Okay, all right, all right. Good, yeah. I see you don't have a fever today, so that's that's good. And so, all right, now for your second problem, the migraine headaches. You do have a history of chronic migraines and you have occasional bouts of of migraines, nothing recent. So, let's continue the exceteran as needed over the counter for treatment there. And then also the sumatriptin as needed for breakthrough migraine pain. And I, I would just encourage you to continue to avoid alcohol benches and caffeine. Bingees and try to get enough sleep and all of that's easier said than done I know so. But, but that seems to be helping you now for your third problem of hypertension, your blood pressure seems to be under adequate control. So, that's good. We'll continue you on the lysinoprol 20 milligrams per day. And I will write you a refill prescription for that. And send that to the pharmacy. Please continue to check your blood pressures daily. So, Karen, how does that all sound for a plan? Any other questions for me?
[patient]  I actually do need a refill on my sumatriptin as well.
[doctor]  Okay, alright, sure you have no problem. So, for your migraines, the migraine problem, I'm also going to write you that that refill prescription for sumatriptin and anything else you can think of.
[patient]  Know the plans sounds good.
[doctor]  All right, sounds good. We'll see you back in about four weeks or so. And actually, I'm going to follow up on your results today before I let you go, but I'll check on those and then we'll see how how you do. And hopefully be able to get you home today. So we'll go from there. I'll see you shortly.
[patient]  Thank you.","CHIEF COMPLAINT

[doctor]  Okay, and how about your diet, how's been thing as far as salty foods?
[patient]  I've been trying to stay away from the salty foods, but sugar intake. I'm having a little bit of trouble with that.
[doctor]  Okay, okay, but it seems like you've been making good progress and that could be difficult sometimes. And you mentioned being around, I think you said your sister a few days ago or a family member.
[patient]  Yeah, she was just kind of sick with similar symptoms, and I noticed I started to develop a little bit of a cough right after.
[doctor]  After that, okay. And how is your family doing how is everyone doing other than that other than being sick for your sister? How is everyone going?
[patient]  Everyone's doing great.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  working busy with life.
[doctor]  Okay, and for you two were you on vacation last week and a lot of people had vacation last week.
[patient]  Yes, I was on vacation last week actually.
[doctor]  Okay, hopefully you weren't sick for too much of it.
[patient]  No, I was feeling okay.
[doctor]  Okay, okay.
[patient]  got back and started feeling poorly.
[doctor]  Sorry about that. Alright, so what I'm going to do now is I'm going to go ahead and start your physical exam. I looking at your vitals, vitals look overall pretty good. I do see your blood pressure is elevated. It's here. It's 144 over 72. Otherwise, everything else looks good. So let's check you out. So first starting, I'm just going to check start with your sinuses. And when I press here, do you have any pain, any tenderness when I do that?
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  No okay, so no frontal sinus tenderness. How about when I press on the on your cheeks here?
[patient]  Maybe a little bit, just a little bit.
[doctor]  on both sides.
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  Okay, so bilateral maxillary sinus tenderness, all right. And I'm just gonna take a look at in your mouth if you can open up, okay. So I do see some, do have some erytheme of the farinx and the tonsils are symmetrical. I don't appreciate any exudates. Now I'm just checking your neck and I do appreciate some anterior cervical adenopathy. All right, and I'm just gonna take a listen to you, all right, so listening to your heart, so you have. A nice regular rate and rhythm and you do still have that two out of six. Sistolic ejection murmur at the left base. Now I'm taking listen to your lungs and on your lungs exam, okay, your lungs are nice and clear I don't appreciate any weasers, rals, or Ronky, all right. And just looking at your lower extremities, I don't appreciate any edema there. So let's talk about my assessment and plan so for your first problem of the cough. So looking at your cough, it does seem like you have an upper respiratory infection. And so basically that's a virus most likely, it's a virus that's causing your symptoms, especially being around someone else who has similar symptoms and seems like most likely they spread it to you. So I want you to continue with doing a lot of the time is just letting the virus run its course and taking things just to help with your symptoms, so drinking lots of fluids that's gonna help you trying, I know you've been doing a cough medicine, you can even try another one you have to be careful with the blood, pressure and diabetes. So you can try like a caricidine. HPP can help with the cough and lots of rest, okay, lots of rest, now we are in a current pandemic. And so something I can check for you if you're okay with that is checking for COVID, if that's okay with you.
[patient]  Yes, I'm okay with that.
[doctor]  Okay, so we will check you for that today and see how you're doing with that. And then we will give you those results. Okay, any questions about that?
[patient]  No questions.
[doctor]  No, okay. So for problem number two, the type two diabetes. So we'll continue you on your metformin 500 milligrams daily or twice a day you had blood work at your last visit. So you'll be do at your next visit for your hemoglobin A1c and that's the check the sugars on your red blood cells. So we do that about every three months. So at your next visit, we'll check that for you and then we will go from there. But it seems like you're doing well with that now as far as problem number three or high blood pressure. So your blood pressure is elevated here and it sounds like it's been you know creeping up just a little bit at home as well. You're on a very tiny dose of the hydrochlorothiazide. So what I would like to do is increase it to 25 milligrams once a day again. I would recommend that you take it in the morning just because you may have noticed it can make you urinate quite a bit and then I would love for you to just continue checking as you have been a few times a week just checking your blood pressure at different times of the day so we can continue to see how you do with that okay.
[patient]  Okay, all right, that sounds.
[doctor]  All right, any questions for me?
[patient]  No questions.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  Thank you.
[doctor]  Thank you all right so, at this point now I'm just going to press the

aci,D2N194,"[doctor]  Hey Betty, how are you?
[patient]  I'm doing okay aside from this left shoulder pain that I've been having for a few weeks now.
[doctor]  Well, well I'm sorry to hear that do you remember what you were doing when the pain started?
[patient]  I can't think about anything specifically, but I am very active and I also have been renovating my basement, so I've been doing a lot with that.
[doctor]  Wow, okay. And do you know if there was any direct or associated trauma that you can think of over the past three weeks like did you fall or hit your shoulder or anything?
[patient]  No no trauma that I can think of it all.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  I don't remember hitting it either.
[doctor]  Okay, now have you ever had pain in that shoulder before?
[patient]  You know I'm active and we'll have aches and pains here and there, but nothing that some Tylenol can't take care of.
[doctor]  Okay, and it's isolated to your left shoulder.
[patient]  It is.
[doctor]  Ok, are you able to move that left arm for me?
[patient]  You know, anytime I try reaching for something or lifting anything I have a lot of pain, and I don't even try to raise my arm over my head because that's it really hurts.
[doctor]  Okay, so now I want to talk a little bit more about that pain or you having pain all of the time or does it wax and when does it come and go?
[patient]  It's all the time and if there's any pressure like when I try to sleep at night, I can't even lay on a side sleeper. And I really give me a hard time because I'm so uncomfortable so the pain is always there.
[doctor]  Okay, so you can't lay on your left side at all.
[patient]  I can't.
[doctor]  All right, now do you have that pain when you lay on your back as well or just on your left side?
[patient]  I mean it's always there, but when I sleep directly on it the pain goes up.
[doctor]  Okay, now let's talk just briefly about your pain. So if you haven't taken anything at all or have you been taking anything at all, let's start with that. Have you been taking anything for the pain?
[patient]  Yeah, I've been taking Tylenol and I'll take two extra strengths Tylenol every six to eight hours.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  and it does help take the edge off.
[doctor]  Okay, that's good now without any Tylenol, what's your pain level?
[patient]  Without any Tylenol, I would say my pain is like a three.
[doctor]  Okay, and then with Tylenol with that.
[patient]  I'm sorry I keep doing that without any Tylenol my pain is like a seven and with Tylenol it goes down to two or three
[doctor]  Okay, that's good, so the Tylenol really does help you that that's a good thing.
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  So you talked about renovating your basement. Did you guys just move in or is it just time for a little house facelift?
[patient]  Yeah, just time we've been living in this house for some time now, and you know with the pandemic we've been home and so decided to do some work.
[doctor]  Nice of you been into the new home depot that they just opened down the street here.
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Yeah, it's nice my wife and I were there this weekend and they just opened two weeks ago so everything's fully stocked and if you guys are doing some renovations you might run down there and you know save big money at Home Depot.
[patient]  I definitely will check that out.
[doctor]  So are you experiencing any numbness or tingling in your arm or hand?
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Okay, so if you don't mind, I'd like to go ahead and do a quick physical exam. I've reviewed your vitals, everything looks good there. And I'm going to do a focused exam of your left shoulder. Now you have limited active and passive range of motion. There is some tenderness of the greater tuberosity of the humerus. And there is no tenderness at the sternoclavicular or clavicular joints. And you have good hand grip bilaterally. Neurovascular exam of your left arm, your cap refill, is brisk in less than three. Seconds and motor and sensation is intact to light touch now for review of your x-ray of that left shoulder. The good news is I don't see any fracture or bony abnormality. So let me talk to you briefly about my assessment and plan okay. So for your first problem of left shoulder pain, your symptoms are most likely due to rotator cuff tendonopathy. This means that the tendons of the muscles of that left shoulder have been injured and the injury happened to the tendons that make up or attached to the shoulder muscles. I'm going to go ahead and order and MRI of your shoulder. Just to make sure nothing else is going on with that left shoulder, I'm also going to go ahead and refer you for physical therapy for approximately six to eight weeks okay. Now during that time I want you to continue to take Tylenol PRN. If your symptoms don't improve, we can then consider maybe like a steroid injection of that left shoulder which could hopefully get you some relief. Now, do you have any questions, comments or concerns about our treatment plan?
[patient]  Yeah, some really active, so do you think that this pain will ever go away?
[doctor]  I do believe that that pain is going to go away many of my patients are successful with point. So we're going to start with that take a conservative approach and see how you do.
[patient]  Okay, all right.
[doctor]  Alright, so I'm going to have the nurse come in and get you some paperwork and I'll see you in about two about two weeks.
[patient]  Alright, thank you.
[doctor]  Thank you.","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Left shoulder pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Betty Rogers is a pleasant 50-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of left shoulder pain.

For the past few weeks, the patient has been experiencing constant pain isolated to the left shoulder. She denies any known injury or trauma; however, she is very active and is currently renovating her basement. She denies any associated numbness or tingling as well. While movements such as reaching and lifting exacerbate her pain, full flexion of the shoulder is the most severe. Her pain is also exacerbated if she lays on her shoulder, which subsequently causes sleep disturbance due to her being uncomfortable. She typically takes Tylenol Extra Strength, 2 tablets every 6 to 8 hours, for aches and pains associated with her active lifestyle, and doing so reduces her shoulder pain to 2-3/10 on the pain scale. Without medication, she rates her pain as 7/10.

MEDICAL HISTORY

The patient denies any previous trauma or injury to left shoulder.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient reports that she has a very active lifestyle. She has also been renovating her basement recently.

MEDICATIONS

The patient reports that she has been taking Tylenol Extra Strength, 2 tablets every 6 to 8 hours.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports left shoulder pain.
Neurological: Denies left shoulder numbness or tingling.

PHYSICAL EXAM

CV: Capillary refill is brisk at less than 3 seconds.
NEURO: Motor and sensation in the left shoulder are intact to light touch.
MSK: Examination of the left shoulder: Limited active and passive range of motion. Tenderness over the greater tuberosity of the humerus. No tenderness at the sternoclavicular or acromioclavicular joints. Good hand grip bilaterally.

RESULTS

X-ray imaging of the left shoulder was performed and reviewed in office today. These reveal no fracture or bony abnormality.

ASSESSMENT

Left shoulder pain.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I believe this is most likely due to rotator cuff tendinopathy. We discussed the nature of this condition in detail, and I have ordered an MRI for further evaluation. I'm going to put in a referral for 6 to 8 weeks of physical therapy, during which time she should continue with Tylenol as-needed. If her symptoms do not improve, we can consider administering a steroid injection.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up in 2 weeks."

[doctor]  Okay playing basketball, how often do you play basketball?
[patient]  First time in two years.
[doctor]  First time in two years did you watch the game last night?
[patient]  Yeah, unfortunately both teams didn't lose, so I was unhappy.
[doctor]  You're going home who you're going for.
[patient]  Neither.
[doctor]  Neither will I was going for UNC. I'm kind of kind of set right now, but anyway, so you say you're playing basketball. You heard felt some knee or knee pop. What part of your knee would you say hurts?
[patient]  It feels like it's on the inside of a knee.
[doctor]  Inside of your neal right, and are you able to bear weight on that leg Matthew?
[patient]  I can now, but I'm favoring it for sure.
[doctor]  Okay, so what type of pain would you describe as it is it stabbing is it?
[patient]  It's real achy.
[doctor]  Real Aiki
[patient]  Since I slept overnight, the swelling has went down some.
[doctor]  Okay, have you taken anything for the pain yet?
[patient]  I tried some Tylenol yesterday.
[doctor]  Alright, did that work for you?
[patient]  A little.
[doctor]  Little do you have any?
[patient]  being off of it helped more than anything.
[doctor]  Yeah, I be I bet I bet I hurt my knee before too and it's pretty painful on a scale of one to ten what would you say your pain level is
[patient]  It's about a four right now.
[doctor]  about a 4 okay so it's not too bad all right so we'll take a look at that knee in a second so we're also here to check up on your hypertension and diabetes so i'm looking here for your hypertension you're taking 5 milligrams of norbask so are you taking that daily
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  Yes, great. I'm so happy when my patients are compliant most of the times they don't take it as as often, but I'm really excited for that. What have your blood pressure has been running? I think today.
[patient]  You're about 140 over 80, it's a little bit high. But I know what we talked about you getting a blood pressure cuff at home and taking those so I don't check it very often.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  But it's usually in the 140s to 150s range on that top number. And then that bottom number is usually around 80, and I read on the Google that that's OK. Is that OK?
[doctor]  I mean it's it's not the best ride it's we should be around 120 over 80 right.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  You're a little bit elevated, and we could talk about changing your medications to try to get that, that down how about your diet house that going.
[patient]  I eat anything I want.
[doctor]  All right, well, we definitely got Tugot Tugot your diet a little bit better. I know after the pandemic a lot of people you know went crazy with the diet myself included, but I know we got Tugot you get back in because for your diabetes I'm looking at your A1C and we we checked it and it was a A7.2 which is not so good right now. So have you been taking I think you're on met form in 500 milligrams daily.
[patient]  I do, but I got to take it sometimes that upsets my stomach. And so I just kind of skip it.
[doctor]  Okay, so yeah, we definitely got to get you to take it. We could try something else. Just if you're having interaction with that medication, what about your blood sugars? Are they taking those daily?
[patient]  Know every once in a while.
[doctor]  Every once in a while, what have they been doing every once in a while when when you do take them?
[patient]  Probably about 150 or so.
[doctor]  Okay, so we got to get those down too. So we will talk about getting you consult nutrition. Just try to get you a better diet. I think you know we want to get you off the medications totally, but you know we got to get you on the right track here. All right, so let me do a quick physical exam on you. I'm going to check your lungs, lungs sound, good check your heart. So listen to your heart. You still do have that grade two out of systolic ejection murmur. All right, but we knew about that already. Had that for a couple of years, so I'm not really worried about that at this at this time. So let me take a look at your knee here. So when I press right here on the inside, the right knee is that painful.
[patient]  Ow!
[doctor]  All right, and let me have you bend it straight and it's painful.
[patient]  A little yes.
[doctor]  A little bit, alright, I'm gonna do a couple of maneuvers here, so your right knee exam shows that you do have pain to palpation of the medial aspect of that right knee also, have some adema, some little bit of swelling some echinosis, as well you do have a negative varus and valgus test of my maneuvers, and you know I do see a little bit of swelling, swelling, little redness, as well in that knee, so we did get an x-ray of your knee-york. Right knee luckily, it was normal, so there's no fractures. No bony abnormalities, which is good so you didn't break anything so based on my or based on your x-ray, and your exam you have an MCL tear well, MCL strain, I apologize, MCL is straight, I don't know if you have a tear yet we got todia, we had to have to do a MRI for that, but basically means you twisted your knee when you're playing basketball right, and so that ligament is strained or torn just to have to get in. MRI to determine if it is, or not in the time being, I want you to continue to take. That Tylenol just to help with that pain, I'm also going to prescribe you some meloxicam 15 milligrams just to help with the pain, and swelling I'm going to put you in a Neomobilizer, and I want you to stay off of that for the next couple of weeks, and we're going to get an MRI as well for that knee, how does that sound?
[patient]  That's okay.
[doctor]  All right for your diabetes, I'm going to need you. We got to get you to start taking your blood sugars daily. We got to keep track of those all right. So I want you to take those daily we'll get a log book so you can keep track of those and bring those back and we can determine how we adjust your medications for now. Also, I'm going to give you a consult to nutrition to try to get your diet a little bit better and then for your hypertension. I'm gonna up your medication up up up up your Norvasta. Five milligrams because your blood pressure is a little bit high and hopefully we can a medication adjustment will lower it down to that 120 over 80 like we like we made all right. So I'm going to see you back in two weeks to have any other questions.
[patient]  Yes, so I heard strawberries can lower your blood pressures or you truth to that.
[doctor]  You know I have and I haven't heard that before you know.
[patient]  You know, I know it's normally they say like the pumice granite seeds or any oxidants and such, but the strawberries I haven't heard you could try it if you want to actually know I don't want you to eat too many strawberries because a lot of sugar in your in your.
[doctor]  Your diabetes isn't going so low right now, so stay away from the strawberries, because that's a lot of sugar you'll need that.
[patient]  Sure.
[doctor]  Alright, so any other questions?
[patient]  I think I'm okay right now.
[doctor]  Alright, so my nurse will be in without appointment and we will see you in two weeks.","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Right knee pain

The onset of his pain began yesterday after he went up for a rebound while playing basketball and felt a pop in his knee. He states that he experienced swelling and difficulty with ambulation following this incident. He locates his pain today to the medial aspect of his knee. His pain is described as aching and is rated at 4 out of 10. In terms of his swelling, he states that this has improved some. He is also able to weight-bear, but he finds that he is favoring his left leg while doing so. His tried treatments include Tylenol with some relief as well as rest.

aci,D2N196,"[doctor]  Mr. Thompson is a 67-year-old male with a history of essential hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis who is here today with elevated and fluctuating blood pressures. So, hi there, Mr. Thompson. It's nice to see you again. Listen, I understand you're having some trouble with your blood pressure control. I would like to discuss that with you. But first, I want to ask you, I'd like to use this app, this new fancy app that's going to help me focus on you a bit. More in our conversation, would that? Be okay with you.
[patient]  Yes, that's fine.
[doctor]  Okay great, it's gonna record our conversation okay. Perfect, so Jerry, tell me Mr. Thompson tell me about your blood pressure readings. Recently I understand you're concerned about them. They have been up, they have been down, what's going on, and any other symptoms.
[patient]  Normally my blood pressure has been very well controlled over about the last three to four weeks. There have been periods where I felt a little light-headed slight headache. And when I check my blood pressure, the upper number has been occasionally over 180, which is way past, you know, what any of the numbers have been the past.
[doctor]  Okay, okay, and okay. And yet it is sound unusual for you. And so it's been high, but you've also felt light-headed at times, have you checked your blood pressure when you were feeling light-headed? Was it low at those times? Or have you done that?
[patient]  I've done it both when I felt fine, and then when I had the lightheaded episodes, actually it's been on the high side.
[doctor]  Okay, all right, understood. And you haven't passed out or anything have you.
[patient]  not recently.
[doctor]  Okay, and have you had any chest pain or trouble breathing along with you know your elevated blood pressure?
[patient]  Sometimes a little heaviness in my chest, but no, no, nothing sustained and I don't have any respiratory or breathing difficulty.
[doctor]  Okay, excellent. And how about any headaches or other neurologic symptoms like numbness or weakness or you know balance instability or anything like that?
[patient]  Little unsteady when I get the dizziness and a slight headache when the blood pressure numbers have been a little higher.
[doctor]  Okay, and when you say dizzy are you feeling lightheaded like you might pass out or you feeling that the world spinning around you or what?
[patient]  Just a little fuzzy where you just feel more lightheaded.
[doctor]  Okay, all right, understood, and you've not had any any fever or nausea vomiting, anything like that have you or diarrhea.
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Okay, and are you feeling any palpitations or your heart racing anything unusual there?
[patient]  Not usually no.
[doctor]  Okay, and are you still taking the licenteprol 20 milligrams once per day? No actually, I see we last visit we increased that to twice per day you're still taking that licenteprol 20 milligrams twice per day.
[patient]  Yes, I am.
[doctor]  Okay, you are not missing doses or anything are you by chance.
[patient]  Very rarely.
[doctor]  Okay, great, great, you're still using that pillbox that we suggested. I think you had a pretty good system going there. Maybe, maybe you're using that app now to take to keep track of one when to take your medicine. Are you doing that?
[patient]  Yes, yeah, if I've used the pillbox and then tried the app, it was a little confusing, but I'm on pretty much on on track with staying on my medication schedule pretty accurately.
[doctor]  That's great. I think I remember you saying it was tricky to get that upset up, but then your grandson helped you with it. And those kids amazing what they can do these days, right? Anything like that. I always trust them. My kids before me. So, hey, by the way, how did he do in his softball or in his and his little league tournament last month? I think you said he had a big tournament coming up. How did that go?
[patient]  They did great. They got all the way to the finals. And then the team, that the team that beat them was probably a little older a little bit more seasoned, but they had a great time.
[doctor]  Wow, wow, how fun, that's fantastic. Well, congrats, good stuff. All right, well, listen, so, so you're still taking your your license, April, how about for your hyperlipidemia, you're your high cholesterol, there are you still taking that out of Boston?
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  Okay, excellent, and your osteoarthritis. I know you've been a golfer in the past, and you know you want to get out on the course, and things is that still under control, are you able to get out, and then walk the full course, and things still.
[patient]  Most of the time, you know, there are times when the weather changes that I have to maybe play. Less play less or skip a day.
[doctor]  Yeah, yeah, but you're still okay while you're still able to get out and then you're kind of taking I think you're taking some Tylenol for you know mild mild pain and changing your activity as needed is that right
[patient]  Correct.
[doctor]  Okay, all right, good, good, okay. Well, listen, let's go ahead and examine you here, Jerry. So on your physical exam for the most part, it's pretty normal and unremarkable on your heart exam. You still have that grade three out of six-estolic ejection murmur that's unchanged from your prior. And just means, yeah, I'm hearing some heart sounds from the valves that's not surprising. And I'm not concerned about it. We're just watching that one otherwise. On your your lung exam, you have some mild bibasiler. Rows, but no weasers or Ronkey and excellent air movement. And you have trace lower extremity edema on your extremity exam there bilaterally. And otherwise, really pretty normal exam. So let's let's talk about my assessment. And your plan, all right, so first of all, for your first problem of your elevated blood pressure, I do think your blood pressure is a little bit out of control, meaning we need to make some adjustments I'm going to actually increase your lysinopril to 60 milligrams twice per day. And I'm also going to add 25 milligrams per day of hydrochlorothiazide. And that should help even things out. I wanted to check your blood pressure measurements twice a day for me for the next two weeks. Then let's see you back in two weeks. And we'll check on how you're doing. And also for your second problem of hyperlipidemia, I want to keep you on the outer vasodine. I'm also going to send a couple of blood tests I'm going to send. A cholesterol panel, also a CBC with differential and A, comprehensive metabolic panel. And we'll check your analysis as well. Look and see how your kidneys are doing there as well. And so we'll continue the current management with your outer vasodine there for your hyperlipidemia. Now for your third problem, osteoarthritis, I want you to continue to stay active as best you can don't over do it, but walking and you know getting out golfing when you can that's great, you can take Tylenol for the pain if you have some mild, some mild pain there. And yet otherwise. I think that cover it. I think the adjustments in your blood pressure medicine should help. And I want to see you back in four weeks. No, let's make two weeks in follow up and otherwise any questions for me. How does that sound?
[patient]  I don't think so. Anything that I need to do when the weather warms up as far as you know my fluids drinking liquids and things.
[doctor]  Yet, you know, be sure you're staying well. Hydrated, you know, six to eight glasses of water per day is a good good idea. And you know, when it warms up, you're certainly going to prespy or more and lose, lose more fluid. So, so I would recommend that you continue to have, you know, a standard six to eight glasses of a fluid intake per day. But, yeah, that you know that should do it. And if you're feeling particularly dehydrated, you might want to increase that if you have an increased activity. Levels so, all right. Any other questions for me?
[patient]  How much beer should I drink?
[doctor]  Probably not the best thing with you know with with with your high blood pressure fluctuating the way it is. So not more than a couple drinks a week hate to tell you.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Alright, okay, great seeing you will see you back to you in a couple of weeks you take care.","CHIEF COMPLAINT

aci,D2N197,"[doctor]  So Donna is a 37 year old female. She is here with complaint of headache. She has a history of hypertension and diabetes. So Donna tell me what's going on.
[patient]  Yeah, lately I've just been having quite a bit of headache and I mean every now and then I'll get it but lately it's just been getting worse and I've noticed that my blood pressure has been running high I've been taking it maybe like once a week but the past three weeks it's been really high than usual so I was a little worried.
[doctor]  Do you remember the numbers that you're getting on your blood pressure readings?
[patient]  Yeah, so one of them was like 160 over 87 and then the last one was like 175 over 92.
[doctor]  Okay, so it's really high I was looking back and it looks like your blood pressure was pretty normal last time we saw you is 124 over 82 have you been able to take your blood pressure medicine the lysin apparel that you've been prescribed.
[patient]  I have, but sometimes I forget, I'm embarrassed to tell you that. But yes, sometimes I forget, I get busy like especially on the weekends, I'm very good during the week, but on the weekends I tend to forget it, and that's when I'm most busy too.
[doctor]  Yeah well I'm also curious, you know you have diabetes, have you been checking your blood sugar?
[patient]  Yeah, I have because I thought maybe you know that's why I'm getting the headaches. Maybe my sugar was too low or maybe too high, but my sugar has been okay. It's been running like 120 sometimes it does get down to like 100.
[doctor]  Okay, and have you noticed are you urinating more than usual or anything like that?
[patient]  Not really so much, it's been pretty much the same, but pretty normal.
[doctor]  Okay, and when you get these headaches, what are you taking for them?
[patient]  While I take my Tylenol hoping it'll just go away and then it does some just for a little bit but then it just goes throughout the day and I start to get them again.
[doctor]  Okay, and when you first had the headaches, what would you rate the headache at zero? No pain. Ten the worst pain ever.
[patient]  I would say when I first get them, it's about I would say 7 out of 10.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  And then after you take the Tylenol, what does it go down to?
[patient]  It goes down to probably about a four, maybe five. I still feel it, I still feel annoying, but it's not as pounding as it normally would be.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  If I didn't take the tile and all.
[doctor]  Yeah, and have you ever had headaches like this before?
[patient]  Not like this, you know, you know, as you know, sometimes I get migraine, but I know I never really take anything for it. That's like once a year or once or every two years, but not like not like this one headaches like this one.
[doctor]  Okay, and have you had any congestion? Anything like that cough runny nose.
[patient]  Yeah, I thought maybe because you know now it's springtime and I tend to get my allergies, but it's very different. And I've not actually had any like runny nose or cough or congestion along with the headache.
[doctor]  Okay, if you tap on your forehead, do you have any tenderness?
[patient]  Right here.
[doctor]  Yeah
[patient]  Just a little not really too much.
[doctor]  Okay, if you tap down here on these bones or cheek bones, any tenderness there.
[patient]  A little bit not as much as I guess if I tap up here.
[doctor]  Okay, and then if you kind of push on your neck around here any tenderness.
[patient]  It is a little tender, but it's not it is a little bit I'd say.
[doctor]  Okay, okay, so you don't have any frontal sinus tenderness, no maxillary sinus tenderness. It sounds like you don't have any lymphedentipathy that would just be if your lymph nodes were tender. So yeah, you know, let's just talk about a few things that I want to do, and then I want you to actually come in and be seen by Dr. Ruth. So first off your headache, I think taking Tylenol is great. You can keep taking that you know your lysiniprol. You're on 20 milligrams once a day, which is a medium dose. But I think we can increase that so for your hypertension and your headaches, I'm going to have you increase your lysiniprol to 40 milligrams once a day.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  And then I want you to keep checking your blood pressure. And I want to order some blood tests I'd like to get some just normal blood work. We'll get a hemoglobin, a1c some laboratory test, things like that. And then for your diabetes, I'm going to have some diabetic education for you that I want you to be able to review. It sounds like your blood sugar has been running a little bit high. And after you get the blood tests after that's all done. I want you to come into see me or doctor Ruth and Wheel. Just make sure that everything is okay that we get your blood pressure under control. Any questions for me?
[patient]  Now I mean I've been walking and I know I get the headaches, but is it alright if I still continue my walks?
[doctor]  Yeah, that's great, I think exercise is wonderful for everything going on go ahead and walk still.
[patient]  Okay, great we'll do that. Thank you.

[patient]  Well, yes, some days it was sharp some days, it wasn't some days, it moved some days it doesn't, but it's mostly on the left.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  That's...
[doctor]  Alright.
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  Unloving the spectrum that we have right here, let's see if we can dig down and get some details while a couple of things I want to ask have you been a bit more tired than lately.
[patient]  No, not recall.
[doctor]  Alright, how about your appetite? Are you hungry or or not as hungry?
[patient]  I would say about his that that's pretty much unchanged.
[doctor]  Okay, your appetite is unchanged. All right, what about your water consumption?
[patient]  I'm sorry what did you say?
[doctor]  No, it's fine how about your water consumption.
[patient]  Yes, but I've been drinking a lot more water and I do realize that I wake up sometimes during the night till you know you use the restroom to pee more than I normally do.
[doctor]  Okay, so we have noticed an increase in your output. Okay. How do you have like any normal activities are you playing any sports?
[patient]  Yeah, I ride, I ride a bike every so often.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  So good, yeah.
[doctor]  Okay, and are you like watching any other sports like did you watch March Madness?
[patient]  No sorry.
[doctor]  Be still my heart okay that's fine I'll forgive you so.
[patient]  Thank you.
[doctor]  Okay, but how is school like? Are you like, are things going well like? Are you enjoying like, your time there?
[patient]  Yes, school is actually going well done. Good grades.
[doctor]  Nice!
[patient]  Although my physics teachers sucks cheese.
[doctor]  They usually do anybody who chooses to engage in physics for the rest of their life, I question their choices, it's fine, okay. But are you and your like while you're at school, like has anybody been sick, I know like with, you know, COVID has been going around, but like have you noticed anybody like that sick all the time around you?
[patient]  Sick all the time everybody is sick these days.
[doctor]  Alright.
[patient]  So
[doctor]  But what about at home, how about your siblings or any of them sick?
[patient]  Most of them are healthy, and most of them are healthy. Although you know I have a brother who smokes, I've told him not to smoke, he doesn't listen.
[doctor] ドン
[patient]  House told not to smoke at the house, but you know anyway.
[doctor]  Okay, so there's a smoker at home, you know, that does that does affect you, so we might have to have a conversation with your brother. And anybody else, but it's good to know that people aren't sick. I do see here, though, that you have kind of a history of recurrent strap. Like, you seem to be having these sore throats a lot. I think it says that you've had for in the last five months is that correct.
[patient]  Yes, Strap and BFS, I'm not quite sure what it just seems to come on, you know, I get this sore throat and fibroid, I'm told I have Strap.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  Sometimes you know my doctor knows what he is doing strep every day, strep every day. But anyway, if he says I have strep then, I have strep.
[doctor]  I okay, I respect that. And I'm glad that you listened to him at the end of the day that's always a good thing alright. So now that we've gotten like kind of a lot of the history out of the way, I do want to do my physical exam. Is that okay?
[patient]  Sure.
[doctor]  Alright, so when I look in your throat, like, I'm not noticing any erythema no swelling or tonsils or midlines, so those look good when I'm feeling here on your neck. I'm not appreciating any like lymphedinopathy, no cervical adenopathy, and like, I want to check those things because I just want to make sure I'm not seeing any physical signs of like any kind of strap right now, right? I don't want to make sure you're not having an infection when I listen to your lungs. I don't appreciate any weasers. Rally's Ronkey. That means I'm not hearing funky. Sounds your heart sounds great, no murmur, no rub, no gallop. When I press on your back, remember you told me you had that left back pain when I press on it as a hurt.
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Okay, alright, great no tenderness on palpation when I press on your abdomen are you feeling any pain?
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  All right, no rebound, no guarding, that's great, okay. So, based on my physical exam, we are going to have a couple conversations, one that's CT that you're your primary care doctor, that the one that you question is judgment, it is showing a couple things that we are a little concerned about. It could be that these recurrent strep episodes, that you've been having it looks like they are potentially, that they are caused something called glomerular. Now, Fridus, right, there's just some swelling here, and we have to be careful of something like that, because it could lead to kidney disease, chronic kidney disease. And we want to make sure that we cut that off right. So, the first thing is I'm going to refer you for your problem of glomerular and fridus, I'm going to refer you to an ant I want them to look at you, and maybe consider taking out your tonsils to see if that could help with some of the recurrent strep though, that you're feeling. But I would like to leave that to them to make that decision for you. And me, we're going to do some more like confirmations, right? I'm going to order some labs, I want several ellipid panel, a UA, a CMP, a CBC, a vitamin D, and a TSH, all of these things will give me more information about kind of like, what's happening in your body right now in terms of like your hormones, and you know your iron levels, and to make sure that you are like getting all the nutrition that you need and that your body is. Operating appropriately, I know that that was a lot of words, but let me know what. Questions do you have about your care and your treatment?
[patient]  How much are all these tests going to cost?
[doctor]  They're going to be free 99 because your mom is paying for them.
[patient]  Okay, that's good to know.
[doctor]  Yes.
[patient]  And when do I have to do those tests?
[doctor]  I would prefer you to get them done as soon as possible. So when you walk out of this room, there is a blood lab. Right next door, I need you to go ahead and do some of those draws, some of them. I will need you to not have eaten. We are going to do them. It's called fasting. And you can make sure that you have an eaten when you do. But they will. The lab text will know. So you will be able to knock out most of those today.
[patient]  Okay, and I'm not sure I will be able to do that today because I have a class right after this.
[doctor]  Sooosh choir
[patient]  and right after that I have to go to work.
[doctor]  one
[patient]  You know if I told you I'm about changing jobs to die.
[doctor]  Know you didn't mention that, but one of the cool things about being a doctor is I can write you a note, so you're going to do it, and then you can go to the class and we could figure it, but like it's really cool that you're changing jobs, I'm happy for you, I hope you know that like it's always great to be able to make some income, and make some decisions that means that you'll be able to start paying for your test soon.
[patient]  Well, yeah, this new job, there is no insurance to my old boss sucks. So I'm hoping I'll get a new boss and hopefully some free food with this UT because it's had a restaurant. So we'll see how that goes.
[doctor]  We might have to have a conversation about the free food at the restaurant if we don't get some of these infections under control because your salt intake is about to be very important okay.
[patient]  Got it!
[doctor]  Alright, okay, so do you have any more questions before I send my nursing?
[patient]  Don't need to get shot today.
[doctor]  No shots today just stopped.
[patient]  Okay, and when do I have to come back for the results?
[doctor]  I need you to come back in a week.
[patient]  Okay, can we do that over the phone by the way?
[doctor]  We could if if your results are normal, but if we need to have additional conversations, I'm going to need you to come back.
[patient]  Excellent.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  Thank you very much.
[doctor]  No problem.","CHIEF COMPLAINT

[patient]  I think that's what I'm taking.
[doctor]  Okay, but you do take it.
[patient]  It's a white pill.
[doctor]  Okay, alright, yeah, I'm not really sure what it looks like, but okay as long as you're taking it, so that's good, and how about your diet? Are you watching or are you watching your salt intake?
[patient]  Not really, I just kind of feel the blood pressure medicine would do what suppose to do.

[doctor]  Okay, have they helped at all with the cough?
[patient]  Little bit, little bit with a calf.
[doctor]  Okay, all right, lastly, I just want to talk a little bit about your diabetes. Now, in terms of your diabetes, are you watching your sugar intake?
[patient]  No, no, I don't even take my blood sugars either.
[doctor]  Okay, are you taking what's that?
[patient]  I'm a bad patient, I don't take my blood sugars.
[doctor]  That's okay, you're not a bad patient. That's okay. It happens. I know things you know you're busy, but you know we do want to do. Want you to stay healthy. You know you are a patient of mine. I want to continue to see you over a long period of time. So it's important for you to know what your diet, you know, because we can have some complications from diabetes like kidney dysfunction and I problems and things like that. And I know that you are 74 and you know you haven't really had a lot of issues up until this point. And you know, so you have a, you know, still a long life to live. So I would like to see, you know, try to, you know monitor your diet and your blood sugars are you taking metformin?
[patient]  Yeah, I think that's the big pill.
[doctor]  Okay, I'm not really sure what it looks like, but you're supposed to be taking a thousand milligrams twice a day, or you're taking it twice a day.
[patient]  Yeah, I'm taking my wife, put into my box, I take something twice a day, I know that.
[doctor]  Okay, how is your wife doing she is a very lovely person? I remember seeing her at your last visit.
[patient]  She's doing fine.
[doctor]  She
[patient]  As long as she stays on the other side of the house now.
[doctor]  Yeah, I say the same thing to my husband. Okay. Well, let's go ahead. I wanted you to just do a quick physical exam. So, I'm going to be calling out some of my exam findings and I'm going to let you know what they mean when I'm done. Okay. So, looking here at your vital signs, you know, you don't have a fever here in the office, which is good your temperature is 98. For on your blood pressure, it seems like you're doing a pretty good job monitoring your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is right where it should be. It's about 125 over 62, which is good. Your heart rate is nice and slow in the 80s and your oxygenation is fine. It's 97% on room air. So, all of that is is really good now on your facial exam. I'm just pressing on your face here. Do you have any pain to palpation?
[patient]  Just right underneath my eyes.
[doctor]  on one on what side.
[patient]  Actually both.
[doctor]  Okay, okay, on on facial examination the patient has pain to palpation of the bilateral maxillary sinuses on nasal exam. There are there is erythema and edema of the nasal terminates bilaterally with associated yellow discharge on throat exam. Can you open up your mouth on your throat exam that the uvula is midline? There is no erythema or edema or exudate in the peritonsular space on neck examination. I do appreciate some bilateral cervical lymphedena pathi and on your lung exam there is course. Ronky present bilaterally that clears with cough on your heart exam your heart is in a nice regular rate and rhythm I don't appreciate any murmur and on your right knee exam does it hurt when I press here?
[patient]  Yep.
[doctor]  Okay, there is pain to palpation on the right knee and I'm just going to move it all around. Does that hurt?
[patient]  Little bit, yeah.
[doctor]  Okay, so there is decreased flexion and extension of the right knee there is associated echinmosis to the right medial knee. There is no evidence of an effusion. Okay, so Billy, what does all of that mean that means that you just have signs of that you have a little bit of an upper respiratory infection that might have caused some congestion in your and your lungs, which we will talk about, okay? And then, and as far as your knee exam, it just shows that you do have some inflammation and some evidence that you had injured it earlier. So let's just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and my plan for you for all of these issues, okay? So for your first problem of your cough, you know I do believe that you just have a viral syndrome at this time you probably have some mild bronchitis. I really just want to go ahead and just you know, recommend some supportive care. You can continue to take over the counter medications we can. Prescribe Gwifeinicin 600, 600 milligrams twice a day to help cough up some of that flam. And I don't think you need any antibiotics at this time. But certainly if your symptoms worsen, I want you to call me. And then we can go ahead and consider ordering a chest x-ray to make sure that you don't have any pneumonia. Okay, how does that sound?
[patient]  That sounds good.
[doctor]  Okay, so for your second problem of your right knee pain, I do believe you have a right medial collateral ligament strain from the fall this morning, and I really want to just go ahead, and I'll prescribe some Meloxicam 15 milligrams once a day, and we can refer you to physical therapy to help strengthen those muscles around that area, and I'm going to go ahead and just order a right knee x-ray just to make sure that you did an injure. Any bones, although I don't think you did, but we'll just go ahead and order that right knee x-ray. How does that sound?
[patient]  Okay, that sounds like good, good plan.
[doctor]  Okay, and then for your third problem of your hypertension, let's just continue on the lysinopryl 20 milligrams a day. I want to go ahead and order a lipid panel to make sure everything is okay from that standpoint. And lastly, your fourth problem, your diabetes. I want to go ahead and order a hemoglobin A1C just to make sure we don't have to make any adjustments to your metformin. And I really want you to try to monitor your sugar intake and report your blood sugars to me through the patient portal. How does that sound?
[patient]  Okay, I'll try that I try my best.
[doctor]  Alright, that sounds good. I'll be in touch with you with those results. Okay.
[patient]  Okay, appreciate it.
[doctor]  Alright, take care, bye.","CHIEF COMPLAINT

aci,D2N200,"[doctor]  All right, okay, Teresa. So I understand that you're having a bit of some headache here. And then your blood pressure has been running. How can you tell me a little bit about what's happening?
[patient]  Yeah, I've had blood high blood pressure for a long time I provider gave me chlorothalodone. I don't really take it because it gives me a stomach ache, but yeah, I get headaches right here on the top of my head. They kind of come and go their throbbing Tylenol helps the headache.
[doctor]  Okay, all right. And then so how long have you had this headache? Has this been recent or like acute or you've been having this for since you've had your blood pressures?
[patient]  It's been on and off for about a month.
[doctor]  A month, okay, all right? And then are you having any other kind of symptoms with that? Like are you having any kind of, you know, dizziness, lightheadedness, any nausea vomiting?
[patient]  Yeah, sometimes I feel dizzy and my vision gets a little blurry.
[doctor]  Okay, all right, how about like chest pain or shortness of breath? Are you experiencing any of that when you have these headaches in your blood pressure?
[patient]  chest pain or shortness of breath.
[doctor]  Okay, very good. Alright. And then you said you were you've taken some Tylenol for that. And you said it did help a little bit or didn't sorry.
[patient]  It does help.
[doctor]  It does help good very good. So how often are you taking your medication? Are you taking that as prescribed daily? It sounds like you missed a few times, but for the most part are you taking it.
[patient]  Yeah, I forget a lot, so I probably take it like every other day.
[doctor]  Okay, every other day, alright. And then are you also now, I know you also have some diabetes. So are you, how are you doing with that? One, are you pretty much taking your metform in every day?
[patient]  I probably take it when I take my other medicine like every other day.
[doctor]  Every other day, okay, so I do see that you know the nurse took your vital signs this morning that your blood pressure is running quite a bit high. It was like 172 over 98. So that's really a little higher than where we want it to be especially that you're on your medication. But what we're going to do is we're going to take a look at you real quick and then we can discuss, you know, maybe there's some changes that we can do in terms of your current regimen. How about diet and you're have you been sticking with that low sodium diet at all?
[patient]  No, I love McDonald's. I eat it all the time.
[doctor]  I love McDonald's to my favorite is Big Mac. I don't know about you, but I got to have my Big Mac with those large fries which you what's your favorite McDonald's treat there.
[patient]  I need to think of what fully a fish I love, layer of fish.
[doctor]  Well, at least you're eating the fish, but they can be very high in sodium, especially the fast foods. So we'll have to talk about maybe they can look at you know some diet changes as well. So the other thing is for you're for your blood sugar. Here I see that you know you're running a bit high as well. It looks like you're like you're about 170 this morning. And I, I, I, I assume that you were fasting last night is that right? Okay. So that's that's a little higher than what we want. It's not bad. It's below 200, but it's getting kind of close to the borderline from where our limit is. So we will take we take a look at that. And also we'll figure out what we can do with that as well. All right. So at this point, how about are you? How is how is work? How is life? It's been good otherwise. How's the family?
[patient]  They're good I did eat a lot of my kids Easter candy over the weekend. So maybe that's why my sugar is high.
[doctor]  Okay, all right, great, all right, all right, just just around Easter. Okay, not not too much during the year, hopefully.
[patient]  Y'all try!
[doctor]  Well, that's good. So let's go ahead and do a physical exam on you real quick here, okay? And so I'm looking at your vital signs. It looks like your blood pressure. I, we mentioned that today is pretty high. Your heart rate looks good. It's within normal limits here. And then your oxygenation is fine. So you did mention you didn't have any shortness of breath. So that's good. So let me just feel around your neck real quick here. I don't appreciate. Any jugular venous distension on your neck exam? I know. Carotid brood. So that's good. Let me go ahead and listen to your lungs and your heart here real quick. All right. So on your osculation of your lungs, they're clear bilaterally on your heart exam, though I do sense a two out of six systolic ejection murmur. Now that was also there last year. So it hasn't changed any. So we'll just keep monitoring that one. And then let me take a look at your extremities here real quick, Teresa. So let me look at your hands. You got a little bit of slight edema bilaterally on your upper extremities. But let me look at your legs here. Okay. So you have a one plus pitting edema noted here on your legs bilaterally. So that means you're retaining a lot of that salt that you're eating unfortunately. Okay. So so let me go ahead and tell you about my assessment and plan here. So definitely what you're experiencing is some uncontrolled hypertension. Now most of the time, you know, it's multifactorial. Right. It's your diet. It could be the medication regimen if you're not following that. And then it might be that we are going to need to change the medication around and also change your diet. But I would like to start with going ahead. And I want to continue your current medication regimen today. I do want to really encourage that you do take that every day. Maybe set a reminder like on your, you know, do you use your iPhone a lot for your reminders and things maybe we can go ahead and do that get a reminder. Make sure that you take that every day. But with that, I would like to go ahead and also monitor your blood pressure. Let's do it three times a week. It can be much when we do it every day. But maybe three times a week do you have a blood pressure monitor at home?
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Okay, so I can recommend some really good ones nowadays that you can use at home, and they're not that expensive, and at least it'll give you some you know idea of what your blood pressure is running at. And then I want you to come back like in a month because I want to go ahead and see how your blood pressure is doing now that you know you're taking your blood pressure medication. Every day the other thing is I do want to go ahead and have a nutritionist come and talk to you about humay. Maybe some dietary changes I'd like for you to start a diet, it's really to help you know a lot of reduce a lot of that sodium intake when you're when you're when you're taking in your food. So a nutritionist is going to be able to help you figure out some foods that you know that you may like that you can actually use as an alternative besides the McDonald's. Although you can have that once in a blue moon, but you know not not too often.
[patient]  Okay, sounds good.
[doctor]  Great, and then for your diabetes, I want to go ahead and let's go ahead and increase your metformin to 1500 milligrams. I think all for that too I want you to go ahead and continue taking your blood sugars to make sure, as as you normally would to make sure that you know that change in medication is actually being effective. All right, do you have any other questions for me at this time?
[patient]  Nope.
[doctor]  Okay, great. Well, I'm going to have the nurse check you out. And I'll have the scheduler schedule you for a one month follow-up. We'll take a look and see how you're doing from there. See if we have then we will move from there. Okay.
[patient]  Sound good, thank you.
[doctor]  Thanks Teresa.","CHIEF COMPLAINT

[doctor]  and does it radiate anywhere.
[patient]  Yet goes down my leg, my left leg.
[doctor]  Okay, all right.
[patient]  Like my toes getting them a little sometimes.
[doctor]  Wow, okay. And how about like, so homicetic goes down your left leg, how about any like are you experiencing any loss of sensation in like the genital or rectal area?
[patient]  I hope not.
[doctor]  That's okay. I-I-it's gonna help me isolate like, what's what exactly is going on so please don't feel embarrassed to answer the questions do you have any weakness?
[patient]  Yeah, sometimes I try to stand up and and like I can't go get weak or if I'm standing up for too long
[doctor]  Okay, so would you would you say that there are certain positions that make you feel better or worse?
[patient]  You like lying on my side? Makes me feel better.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  And then you said that standing also makes it worse right.
[patient]  You have to stand for a while.
[doctor]  Okay, and then have you experienced any like loss of control of like your bladder or your bowels?
[patient]  Yeah, I pooped myself once.
[doctor]  Okay, so in continents just once though like over the last two years, right, it's not like a consistent thing.
[patient]  No, it's not consistent. I think I stood up for too long. I think I was drinking too.
[doctor]  Okay, okay you mentioned earlier that you tried some things in the past like what were they?
[patient]  So I had a doc gave me some injections before I'm not sure what they were though.
[doctor]  Okay, all right. And I see in your chart here that you had physical therapy. Did you feel that that was effective?
[patient]  No, I feel like I could do them the same exercises at my house like they charge me and like it.
[doctor]  Okay, but did they did the exercises help?
[patient]  I mean, I guess a little.
[doctor]  Okay, not as so not as effective as we would have liked did they put you on any pain medications.
[patient]  Yeah, it was just a white pill, I'm not sure what it was.
[doctor]  Okay, don't worry. I think I can look that up in your chart. I just want to make sure that we have the story straight. All right. So I know that you said that you mentioned that you played basketball you know before. How? How like what's your activity like now?
[patient]  I'm gonna sit at home all day.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  Watch TV.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  So not very active, I've gained about 80 pounds a past year.
[doctor]  Okay, that's a pretty okay, that's a pretty significant weight gain. Well, I just have a few more questions. Have you do know if any of your family members have spine conditions?
[patient]  I think my fourth cousin has scoliosis.
[doctor]  Okay, okay, but that's a little distant, but anybody direct like Sister Brother Mom Dad.
[patient]  I don't think so. I mean, I don't even my dad though.
[doctor]  Okay, okay. And then do you have a personal history of smoking?
[patient]  What type of smoking?
[doctor]  Any smoke you don't have to tell me exactly, but...
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Have you smoked?
[patient]  Next maybe that I haven't.
[doctor]  Are you it's okay? I'm your doctor. I'm not here to judge you. I just want to make sure that I'm like you know when the conclusions that we come to and like my assessment and plan for you I need to know this information. So one more time do smoke or have you smoke before?
[patient]  Okay, I smoked.
[doctor]  Okay, that's fine how much and how often and what was it?
[patient]  I'm not telling you all that I'm just telling you I smoked.
[doctor]  Okay you have.
[patient]  Too many questions are you the fit?
[doctor]  I'm your doctor I have to.
[patient]  Are you the fence you sound like the fence next question?
[doctor]  I'm not an op I promise alright that's fine, but let me know where you currently like smoking.
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Okay, okay, I just have to ask all right, so I do want to do a quick physical exam. I did review your vitals and like part of why I want to know about your smoking history is that you are stating kind of low like it looks like you are might be in the 95%ile range and so we might need to explore some things.
[patient]  Set them off here.
[doctor]  Pardon.
[patient]  because I'm fat my cousin was fat too and he gained a bunch of weight he had to have oxygen.
[doctor]  You know, honestly, there are a few other factors weight gain doesn't necessarily help you right, but like smoking has like a stronger impact. So, but it's okay we can explore like you know other options here. I as I listen to your heart you have a regular rate and rhythm I don't appreciate any murmur on so I'm going to go ahead and do a back exam. I don't notice any overlying erythema or echinosis on your skin so no redness or bruising when I push here on your spine. Does that hurt? Okay, so there. Is midline tenderness on the L4L5 disc space with right-sided lumbar paravertibral tenderness when you bend forward does it hurt?
[patient]  It hurts.
[doctor]  Okay, and when you bend backward does it hurt?
[patient]  A little bit.
[doctor]  Okay, so pain with lumber flexion and extension all right and as I raise your leg does this hurt when I raise your leg up.
[patient]  Stop.
[doctor]  Okay, so supine straight leg test positive. All right, just a couple more things on neurological examination. There is decreased sensation to light touch at the right lateral thigh at L4 dermatometome patella and Achilles reflexes are symmetrical. So I just wanted to make sure that I documented all of that in your chart and in you can ask me any questions, but I did look over the results of the...
[patient]  What does that mean like am I dying?
[doctor]  No, no, no, you're not dying, but I think we have, I think I have a good idea of what's causing your back pain. So first, let's talk about the MRI that you had the results show a disc desiccation, a disc bulge with Paris and Paris Central Discerniation resulting in moderate right for neural ferraminal stenosis. Okay.
[patient]  That's a big word.
[doctor]  Those are huge words, it's okay. So let me tell you what like, what all this means, and what we're going to do like for my assessment and plan. So for your problem of chronic lumbar back pain, based on your symptoms, your exam, and reviewing your MRI that's consistent with a herniated disc at the L4L5 with ridiculous opathy, what this means is that one of your discs that sits between your spinal vertebrae is bulging out, and this bulges, pinching on some nerves that's why you feel the tingling in your leg. All right, so that it's also why you felt pain when I pushed on that area. So I'm going to recommend some a spinal injection with a strong anti-inflammatory medication called a corticosteroid. Right, I think you said that you had one before, but I think this is something.
[patient]  I had to have someone hold me down, I don't like needles. So do you can I take a pill I don't want that?
[doctor]  We could, yeah, we could give you something to help calm down like the anxiety. I would just write you a prescription for one and you would take that maybe three hours before you came in for your appointment and then you should feel calm enough to be able to do the injection.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Alright.
[patient]  Cigat pain pills too.
[doctor]  Can you?
[patient]  for pain.
[doctor]  Can you get what now?
[patient]  Pain pills.
[doctor]  So once I inject the Codacoid steroid and then your spine, it's going to happen under fluoroscopy, right? And it's going to be, it's just a type of like x-ray sorry to because I need to be very specific in where I do this injection. So I say this because you shouldn't need any more pain pills after we do this injection, it should help with the inflammation and directly target the bulge to help you out. So after this injection, give it maybe a day. And if you say that you're still experiencing pain, then we can talk about maybe giving you pain medication, but remember before you said it wasn't as effective. So I think this steroid shot is the best chance that we have.
[patient]  I'd say it wasn't effective.
[doctor]  Okay, sorry, I saw that they gave you strong pain meds, but remember you said the white one did you say it was effective?
[patient]  Yeah, I said, I said the white ones I said they worked.
[doctor]  Okay, I'm sorry. So all right. So maybe when let's okay. So what we're still going to do though, we're going to do the injection. And then if it still hurts after that, then we can explore that pain medication. I don't want you to have to consistently be on pain medication. It's not necessarily like a good long term solution. After we monitor this, you still are experiencing pain. We're going to try the pain meds. However, I would maybe recommend surgery.
[patient]  I don't want to know.
[doctor]  Right, and so this is where we're just going to try everything that we can before, you know, before we get to that place.
[patient]  MM
[doctor]  Do you have any questions?
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Alright.
[patient]  When it went, is it when, am I having this this? When do you want me to get this injection?
[doctor]  Okay, so you're going to go to the front and schedule it. This is a very quick and common procedure. It should only take about an hour. We will need to do this note like if this if this is successful, we would only maybe do this four times a year. So whenever at the front desk go ahead and schedule, I think that mine pretty available to be able to help you with this. I'll write any other questions.
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Okay, thank you.","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Back pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Steven Reed is a pleasant 60-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for evaluation of back pain.

At times his pain will radiate down his left lower extremity. He also reports experiencing intermittent numbness in his toes. Prolonged standing exacerbates his pain and makes him feel weak. He is able to get some pain relief when laying on his side. In terms of his bowel and bladder habits, he reports 1 episode of incontinence over the last 2 years which he believes was due to prolonged standing and possible alcohol consumption. He other denies any other changes and denies loss of sensation in the genital or rectal area. He has tried an injection in the past, but notes that he does not like needles and had to be held down. Pain medication was tried but he is unable to recall the name of the medication. He also attended physical therapy with minimal relief. Currently he states that he is not very active and tends to watch tv all day. He has gained 80 lbs over the last year.

SOCIAL HISTORY

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and MRI findings today, I explained to the patient that he has a herniated disc at L4-5 with radiculopathy. We discussed the nature of the diagnosis as well as treatment options. I have recommended that we start with a spinal corticosteroid injection under fluoroscopy. The nature of the procedure was discussed. A prescription was given today to help with his anxiety during the injection as he states he does not tolerate needles. We also had a long discussion regarding pain medication. I advised him that we can do up to 4 injections per year and that we need to hold off on proceeding with pain medication until we assess his progress. I also explained to him that pain medication is not a long term solution and that if he remains symptomatic, it is possible surgery would be recommended.

INSTRUCTIONS

aci,D2N202,"[doctor]  Good morning Sharon, how you doing?
[patient]  Hi, I'm Ok today. I'm having some shoulder pain.
[doctor]  I see that I see that here in the nurse's notes, it looks like you're having some right shoulder pain says here that you guys have been remodeling your house. What do you do remember what you were doing when that right shoulder pain started?
[patient]  Yeah, I was up on a ladder painting and kind of reaching out and felt like a fall and kind of brace myself, but I was painting.
[doctor]  Okay, so it just sound like there might have been some direct trauma to that area. Now it says here that this happened about three weeks ago where you able it sounds like you were able to get up and continue, but you were having some pain did you take anything at that time to help with that shoulder pain.
[patient]  Yeah, I iced the arm and then I also, I also took some advelle.
[doctor]  Okay, now have you had any shoulder pain before of that right shoulder or is this the first time or or the first insult to that area?
[patient]  First time.
[doctor]  Okay, and now are you able to move that right arm for me?
[patient]  Yes, I'm able to move, but I do have some pain lifting overhead raising my arm overhead.
[doctor]  Okay, all right. Now do you have pain all the time or does it come and go?
[patient]  is some pain is all the time, but it's some is intermittent.
[doctor]  Okay, now you mentioned that you had taken some ibuprofen for that pain now. Let's talk a little bit about your pain rating. Okay. Zero being none ten being the worst pain you've ever felt in your life. Can you rate your pain for me without any Tylenol or Advil or any N said. Can you rate your pain for me?
[patient]  about a six.
[doctor]  Okay, now when you take that medication, can you rate your pain for me? What's that pain level get to?
[patient]  It goes down to about a four.
[doctor]  Okay, so it does help take the edge off of that pain and you're able to kind of move around a little bit then.
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  Okay, so the remodel tell me a little bit about that my wife and I were working on our remodel and we went they just built the brand new lows here in town. Have you guys been there yet?
[patient]  No, we have not.
[doctor]  Well, I didn't know if you know this or not, but you can save big money there that's the rumor.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  So yeah, we've been down there, we got some pain, we got went and got some samples. And then hey, while we were there, we ended up deciding to put down a bunch of flooring too. So I really recommend you guys if you get a chance to go over there and take a look at their sales and then see if you can't finish your remodeled project.
[patient]  That sounds great. I'll have to take a look at the flooring as well.
[doctor]  That sounds good, so now just out of curiosity are you experiencing any numbness or tingling in in your arm or hand?
[patient]  I did when I initially heard it, but I'm not no longer having any numbness or tingling.
[doctor]  Okay, so a little bit about my physical exam. I'm going to do a quick physical exam on you today. Now your vitals look good, but specifically on your right shoulder exam, you do have limited active and passive range of motion. And there is tenderness to the greater tuberosity of the humerus. Now there is no tenderness at your sternoclavicular joint, and you do have good strong bilateral hand grips and on your neurovascular exam. Of your right arm, you do have brisk capillary refill of less than three seconds, and you do have equal and bilateral response to sensation and touch, which is good now taking a look at your x-ray that we did when you came in today good news is that right shoulder x-ray reveals no fracture or bony abnormality in K. So let me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan now are your symptoms are most likely due to rotator cuff tendinopathy. I think that you've injured the tendons of the muscles that make up the shoulder, so that I think that's why you are. Having that shoulder pain, I do want to order an MRI of that right shoulder just to make sure that nothing else is going on now. I'm going to refer you to physical therapy, and that's going to be about six to eight weeks now. My patients are very successful with their point. And let's see how you do before we make the decision that we would do additional treatments such as a steroid injection to that shoulder. I do want you to continue to take an end set. If you can tolerate Tylenol, I want you to go ahead and take Tylenol for that pain. Do you have any questions, comments, or concerns about our treatment plan?
[patient]  No, I think it sounds good. Can't wait to get some relief.
[doctor]  Okay, so I know we ordered it for 68 weeks, but I want to see you again in two weeks and we'll evaluate how you're doing and make some additional treatment plan at that at that time, okay?
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Alright sounds good, we will get the nurse come in and she will take care of you and I will see you in two weeks.
[patient]  Thank you.
[doctor]  Thank you.","CHIEF COMPLAINT

aci,D2N203,"[doctor]  Good afternoon, Matthew. How are you?
[patient]  I'm okay.
[doctor]  It looks like here that you've been brought in for some vision changes and looks like you're having trouble with your right. I can you tell me a little bit about what brought you into see me today.
[patient]  Yeah, you know, I started noticing my wife and I we we eat out almost every night and it's one especially when we go to fancy place.
[doctor]  Mmm.
[patient]  I have trouble adjusting into that dark dim environment.
[doctor]  Okay, and I reviewed my technicians' notes before I came in to see you. And it says you know you've been having that decreased vision when you're reading especially in dark place like you just said. But it also mentions here that it looks like you told her that when you look at straight lines like in your doorframe, it looks like things have been looking a little crooked to you how long has that been going on.
[patient]  Well, you know it's been going a little while probably getting worse over the last three to four months. And you know my office is paneling and you know how that paneling has that dark grooves in it those straight lines. Well, they always look wavy to me.
[doctor]  Okay, all right. So it's been going on a few months. Now you mentioned that you and your wife go out to eat every night have you tried the new the new Italian place over there on Main Street.
[patient]  My gosh, yes, we were just there the other night down and it's down in the basement of that big building. Yeah, we went there the other night and I got to tell you it was like the soprano family was sitting across from us. There was this bunch of old guys that had bottles of a red wine all over the table and there were my gosh. It was so good and the food. I mean, I mean, I can't tell you how great the food was.
[doctor]  It was.
[patient]  It was just phenomenal.
[doctor]  It was amazing my wife and I went over there the other day and when we walked downstairs it was like I was walking into a scene out of sopranos.
[patient]  MM
[doctor]  But the food was amazing, it was the best eggplant farmers, John. I've ever had where really super excited about going back there here very, very soon.
[patient]  Yeah, I had the bio-marcel and it was my gosh it was to die for.
[doctor]  I'll have to get that next time I go so in reviewing your paperwork here it looks like you made mention that you smoke are you still smoking about a pack a day?
[patient]  Yeah, I try to try to have done hypnosis, I've done lasanges, I've done chewing gum, and I get real close. But you know, I'll just go out one evening without the wife. And in the next thing I know, I'm only know buying a cigarette off of somebody. And it's really hard for me to get that stopped.
[doctor]  Yeah, I appreciate that, but it's really going to be important that you try to either cut back or quit smoking altogether now that leads me into my next concern here. It looks like you have a history of high blood pressure, and I'm just wondering are you taking your blood pressure medication as prescribed, and are you checking your blood pressures on a regular basis.
[patient]  I'm glad you just mentioned that because I haven't taken my blood pressure pill for a while it's up in the cupboard and it's back in that corner and I just I can't forget to take it.
[doctor]  Okay, it's really going to be important that you take your medication for your blood pressure as prescribed. I'd really like to see start doing that today. And then let's let's go ahead and then let's set that that pill bottled down on the counter and see if that doesn't help you remember to take that blood pressure medicine. If it's okay with you, I would like to do a quick physical exam on your eyes. I'm going to go ahead and take off your glasses and put your chin here in the chin rest for me.
[patient]  Okay, that's a bright light.
[doctor]  Yeah, I'm sorry about that. It's just going to help me check the lenses in both of your eyes. So it looks like the anterior segment examination reveals posterior chamber interocular lenses in both eyes for the right eye. The cornea is clear known VP colcup to discus. Two funnest examination of the right. I chose the retina to be attached 360 degrees no holes or tears noted and RPE changes in the fovia. Now the posterior segment exam shows Ducin in the macular retinal thickening and presence of sub retinal fluid and exudate accumulation. And it is positive for a hemorrhage. Now for your left eye, the cornea is clear no NVI peculcup to discus. Three RPE changes in the fovia no hemorrhage noted or sub retinal fluid noted. And the retina is attached appropriately. Now I reviewed the results of your diagnostic exam. So the OTC exam shows those Ducin deposits under the RPE which is the retinal pigment epithelium and then the sub retinal fluid. So the SRF accumulation and coroidal neovascular membrane can also be visualized in that test now the fluorescene angiography. So the using the the fluorescene there reveals that the focal area of the leakage in the right eye is consistent with neurovascular age related macular degeneration now for my impression and plan it looks like the diagnostic test. And the eye exams are consistent with the neovascular age related macular degeneration also called wet macular degeneration now it's advanced to a stage that usually leads to more severe vision loss happening. Now this happens when those abnormal blood vessels start to grow beneath the retina. What happens is they leak fluid and blood which is. Why it's called wet macular degeneration. And what happens is secondary to that it creates a large blind spot in the center of your visual field that's why it kind of looks like you'll see a black dead in the center of your vision field now. It is the most common cause of severe vision loss. Now the good news is we have a plan for you for this now once a month I want to give you an injection of lucent now it's going to be injected in the vitrious portion of the eye after we numb the eye so you're not going to feel any pain and those injections yeah I know the one once I numb the eye you won't feel any pain in that injection at all patients report no pain at all for the actual injection.
[patient]  Have you ever somebody stick a needle in your eye?
[doctor]  Well...
[patient]  Want me not not, you literally stick a needle in your eye.
[doctor]  Yeah, literally yeah.
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  The good news is injection given over time can slow the rate of the vision decline. And maybe even stop it however, I also have to let you know that there could be a situation where you may still know to small amount of vision loss, but this is your best chance of maintaining that vision for as long as you can. So I know I have given you a lot of information I want to pause here and see if you have any questions, comments or concerns before we get. You scheduled for that injection.
[patient]  Now, as long as you think it won't hurt a lot, that will be good.
[doctor]  Okay, I think it's going to be our best plan to help slow this disease process.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Alright, so I'm going to have the nurse come in and get you prepped and we're going to go ahead and do the first injection today.
[patient]  Okay, okay.
[doctor]  Sounds good I'll be back in a couple of minutes.

Vision changes in the right eye.

MEDICAL HISTORY

Patient reports history of high blood pressure.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Patient reports he is smoking 1 pack of cigarettes daily.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Eyes: Reports right eye vision changes.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Eyes
- Examination of the right eye: Posterior chamber intraocular lenses present bilaterally. Right eye cornea is clear without NVI and cup-disc ratio is 0.2. Fundus of right eye shows retina is intact 360 degrees without holes or tears noted, and RPE changes in fovea. Posterior segment shows drusen of the macula, retinal thickening, and presence of subretinal fluid and exudate accumulation. Positive hemorrhage
Examination of the left eye: Cornea is clear. No NVI. Cup-disc ration is 0.3. RPE changes in fovea. No hemorrhage noted or subretinal fluid noted. Retina is attached appropriately.

RESULTS

OTC:
Drusen deposits under the RPE. SRF accumulation and choroidal neovascular membrane can also be visualized.

Fluorescein angiography:
Reveals that the focal area of the leakage in the right eye is consistent with neovascular age related macular degeneration.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Wet macular degeneration.
- Medical Reasoning: The diagnostic test and eye exams are consistent with neovascular age-related macular degeneration, also called wet macular degeneration.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I explained the nature of the diagnosis and that this is advanced to a stage that usually leads to more severe vision loss happening. We discussed this happens when those abnormal blood vessels start to grow beneath the retina leaking fluid and blood. Secondary to that, it creates a large blind spot in the center of his visual field. He was advised that this is the most common cause of severe vision loss. I explained the treatment plan at length. He understands he is going to be injected in the vitreous portion of the eye after we numb the eye, so he is not going to feel any pain. I advised injections given over time can slow the rate of the vision decline and maybe even stop it. However, I also have to let him know that there could be a situation where he may still note a small amount of vision loss, but this is his best chance of maintaining that vision for as long as he can. Additionally, patient was counseled on the importance of taking his blood pressure medication. Questions were invited and answered today.
- Medical Treatment: Lucentis injections once a month with his first being performed today.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan."
aci,D2N204,"[doctor]  Okay, well, hi, Joe, I understand you've hurt your knee. How, how are you doing?
[patient]  I'm doing okay, this feels, you know, definitely feels like it's swollen and kind of hurts me a little bit.
[doctor]  So what did you do what happened?
[patient]  I was skiing with some of some friends and I was going down. It was snowing pretty hard and I couldn't really see as as the two paths kind of come came together and at the front and the skis, I kind of dug into the snow and I ended up basically doing a cartwheel but kind of like stopped halfway through and could feel a pop up on my right knee and then you know just pain right after that came about through the knee so.
[doctor]  Yeah, that sounds painful. And so when did this occur?
[patient]  It occurred over the weekend on Saturday.
[doctor]  and have you been able to to walk at all at all or no?
[patient]  a little bit, but it's definitely swollen and it's definitely painful.
[doctor]  Okay, so what all have you been doing for the pain?
[patient]  just like taking some, you know, Advil, and then just icing, you know, icing on and off, you know, a little heat here. And they're just, you know, trying to comfort, but that's about it.
[doctor]  Have you ever had any type of injury to your knee before and it is the left or right knee?
[patient]  It's the right knee, no, it's the first time I've had any knee injuries.
[doctor]  Okay, all right. Let's see. Take anything for it. Okay. Well, let's see. Let's just do a quick physical exam here. So, so you're now your vitals. Those look all right. You're no fever. You're at 97. Nine, your heart rate is 64. Sounds healthy. Respirations are 16 blood pressure is 110 over 74. Your O2 sat looks good. You know, 98%. So look real healthy there. And so I'm just going to do a quick physical exam. So I do appreciate some edema and some echinemosis around surrounding your knee or right. You said right knee right.
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  OK, positive pain to palpation. And let's bring your leg out, are you having pain when with flexion or extension?
[patient]  A little bit no-no-no crazy real pain, but there is definitely some pain there.
[doctor]  Okay, pain with flexion and extension and how about the range of motion having full range of motion here?
[patient]  Yeah, pretty much I can get the full range, just feels a little tight and will hurt.
[doctor]  Okay, all right. And for diagnostics, so you're X-ray. So there's no fracture appreciated, no bony abnormalities. So that looks all right. So let me tell you a little bit about my impression and plan with this. So you have a knee contusion. So for treatment, well, we need to rest that apply Icno two, three times a day for 20 minutes at a time, take some NSIDS or, you know, non-stroidal anti-inflammation such as ibuprofen every six to eight hours as needed. So I just want to really get some rest with that. If that doesn't improve, then we can go ahead and maybe come back in and we might do some physical therapy as well. I don't know. I'm not sure I like this one all that well. I need you have any questions on that.
[patient]  No sound very good.
[doctor]  Okay, let's venture a little bit more because I need five minutes. So we're so where were you skiing at?
[patient]  So I was actually up, we actually took a trip up north and I was in the I'm in Mount St. Helen in Washington. So I was just walking in myself going out and stuff but it was a good trip but cut a little short because of that. Yeah, it was fun though. I like going out, I like going skiing so hopefully I can do some more.
[doctor]  Well, Washington sounds nice I haven't been there, but it sounds like it's pretty nice area to be in, and they have a lot of maple syrup that don't they produce a lot of maple syrup.
[patient]  They do have a lot of maple syrup, and it's interesting that the winter actually isn't their busiest time for vacation or vacations, or it's more into your spring and your fall with hikers, and all the outdoor activities, there's actually a very impulsive tourist during the summertime, which I never knew, but one of the locals have told me that they do actually better business during the summer, so the hikers kayakers. And the maple syrup in the fall and everything so.
[doctor]  That sounds good now. I also meant to ask you. So when you did this cartwheel through the air, did you have any other injuries to any other parts of your body, anything else that you're having any issues with?
[patient]  My shoulder feels a little bruised.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  little bit but that's about it yeah just because i kind of landed on that lead shoulder when i fell
[doctor]  Okay, let's take a quick look. Yeah, I do appreciate a little bit of bruising here. Are you having any problem raising it up or or with movement with your range of motion?
[patient]  Once I raise it up, though, it is a little little tender. I can feel it being tender when I raise it up.
[doctor]  Okay, we'll just go ahead and get an x-ray of that right shoulder too, just to be sure if you, because who knows, maybe you might have done something with that as well. So we'll go ahead and have my nurse take you to do that, and then we'll talk again, all right.
[patient]  Sounds great.","CHIEF COMPLAINT

aci,D2N205,"[doctor]  Hey Angela, how are you?
[patient]  But how are you?
[doctor]  I'm good, so I see we are here you had a recent diagnosis of stage three non-small cell lumb cancer. And so we are following up on your Neo-Advent chemotherapy. So you can you tell me how you're doing today.
[patient]  Yeah, you know what I'm doing? Okay. I have a little bit of some shortness of breath that I noticed over the weekend. And, you know, I might consider myself pretty active before this. I would walk my dog around the block. And now I can't even walk you know down the street without being short of breath.
[doctor]  Okay, yeah, yeah, I mean that's definitely understandable. It says you had a 4.4 centimeter left upper lobe nodule in there. So it's kind of big, but that's understandable. And we're doing the chemo to try to reduce that that tumor that you do have so how often do normally run with your dogs.
[patient]  I mean I would take them for I would normally take them for like my long walks every day. And just this weekend I could only walk down to the end of the street. I had to have my husband take the dog fit walk.
[doctor]  Man, okay what kind of dog do you have?
[patient]  I have a doberman.
[doctor]  Yeah, they are pretty active that makes sense alright so have you been coughing? Have you had any flim?
[patient]  I've been having a dry cough no flam.
[doctor]  Okay, have you noticed any fever?
[patient]  No fever.
[doctor]  No fever, all right, what about any other symptoms like any body aches, any sore throat sinus pain?
[patient]  Want me now that you mentioned it like every time I swallow it hurts, it doesn't feel like I have a cold because it hurts down here more in my chest, but every time I swallow it it's really painful.
[doctor]  Okay, so when you're swallowing, I know some of my patients feel this, do you feel like the food is getting stuck?
[patient]  No, the food is not getting stuck, it just hurts.
[doctor]  Okay, what about when you're taking liquids are you able to take in both hydro court liquids?
[patient]  I mean, I definitely feel like over the weekend, I haven't been taking it as much because it hurts so much, but I am able to, I am able to drink and I've been taking insure and things like that I had a milkshake.
[doctor]  Okay, that's that's that's that's good. Yeah, we would definitely want you to take in as much liquid as possible best especially since you're on the chemotherapy and the radiation just so you won't get dehydrated because that will make you feel a lot worse if you are dehydrated. Okay, so on on a mental emotional standpoint, I know you said you have your husband with you how you're doing with that you have the support that you need you need to speak to. Me though.
[patient]  It's very helpful, you know, as you can understand, I'm just like devastated when I got this diagnosis. And I'm just trying to figure everything out, but he is very good and my daughter is very helpful too. And I think for the most part I'm very fortunate to have them.
[doctor]  Okay, so how are you feeling on your chemo sear on a combination of sysplatin and atop a chide you had your last dose a few days ago? Any nausea? Any fatigue from that?
[patient]  I was a little nauseated and tired, but I took the zoo friend that you prescribed, and that seemed to help, and you know I got some rest, it's been okay.
[doctor]  Okay, that's good. So let me do a quick physical exam on you. Just going to check your vitals here. So your vitals are normally your pulse ox is okay. So everything's good with that. So I'm going to feel your neck on your neck exam. I don't appreciate any cervical lymphedinopathy, no subclivicular adenopathy, your heart exam, regular rate, and rhythm, no murmur, your lung exam. So I do notice some crackles in your lungs bilaterally. That's just a faint sound we hear when you take a deep breath. So that could mean you have some fluid in there. And that is to be expected to do to your lung cancer diagnosis. So I'm going to look at your skin exam. So on your skin exam on your chest, I do see some erythema on the anterior aspect of your chest on the left side. And that could be due to that radiation. Sometimes patients do get a radiation burn. And it's it'll get better with time, especially once you're done with the radiation treatment. And on your extremity, there is no lower extremity edema in your legs so prior to coming to see me. You did get a chest x-ray. It looks like you do have mild radiation humidis that means you have inflammation of your lungs due to the radiation. So let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you. So your first diagnosis, you know, is as the lung cancer. So we're going to continue you on that chemoregiment on that you do have continue on that that current radiation doses. I think you're on 45 grade. Yep, you're on that. And then when the when the regimens complete, we'll do some more testing. And hopefully we can see a resection of that tumor. So that has just gotten a little smaller and we can go inside and then take it out. So for your second diagnosis, the radiation humidis, I'm going to prescribe you a low dose steroid prednisone 40 milligrams one tablet a day for five days. Have you been on a steroids before?
[patient]  No, I've only ever heard bad things about them. They make people jittery and gain weight.
[doctor]  I mean, and I for you, that's that that's for patients that you know who are on them for a long period of time, right? You're only going to be on it for five days that shouldn't affect you too bad. You might feel when you're coming off of it after the five days, a few muscle aches other, then that you should be fine. You shouldn't really experience much weight gain other other than not, not much at all, since you're only on it for five days. So, but that's going to help you. Reduce some of the inflammation. In your lungs, help you breathe better. So, we can continue the radiation treatment because we definitely need to do that because our most important thing right now is to try to decrease the size of that tumor okay. And then for your third issue, the audiophagia, or it comes terms the painful swallowing, right? You said you had that from the from the radiation. So, that's from the inflammation of your lungs that's kind of creeping up to your esophagus. That's why you're feeling that pain. So, I'm going to prescribe you a lidocaine squishy and swallow. You can do that four times a day. And so, you'll do it and you'll be able to eat immediately afterwards because it would do some of that pain free from swallowing. And that will help you taking liquids and food because we definitely need you well off it and hydrated while you're going through this cancer therapy okay.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Alright, so, do you have any questions for me?
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  All right, so we will get you those medications, those prescriptions, and then we will see you back in two weeks.
[patient]  Okay, great thank you.

[patient]  And I'm your patient, yeah.
[doctor]  Yeah
[patient]  I've been having pains, let's just say for the last two weeks.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  It starts up in the right flank and radiates down to my groin and you know it's under control, but I have bouts where it kind of gets a little out of control.
[doctor]  Okay, so is it a constant pain or does it come and go for you?
[patient]  It comes and goes, it depends on how much I've been drinking, and you know what sort of activities I've been doing, but it's still there.
[doctor]  Alright, so have you noticed any pain when you've been urinating?
[patient]  Not really.
[doctor]  Okay, have you noticed any blood in your urine?
[patient]  No blood I did have an episode where the pain radiated to one of my testicles which was kind of weird but but yet it sort of calmed down a little bit in that regards.
[doctor]  Okay, have you taken anything for the pain?
[patient]  I've been taking some ibuprofen and that kind of like calms it down a little bit, but it persists.
[doctor]  Okay, and what would you say like your pain score is out of ten?
[patient]  It's probably a 4 out of 10 when it gets a little more out of control for the most part. It's probably in the order of 1 or 2 out of 10.
[doctor]  Okay, so it is it's it's not too bad.
[patient]  It's a new ones, yeah, but I know it's there it doesn't go away.
[doctor]  Okay, yeah, yeah. A lot of my patients you know have that minor pain, so you.
[patient]  I'm a horrible active by the way.
[doctor]  No, yeah, that's that's that's totally fine. That's totally fine. You know, I'm just playing the doctor on TV. So good good all right So have you had any other symptoms nausea vomiting anything like that?
[patient]  No nausea, no vomiting. I had some I felt like it might have been like chills, but no fever's nothing along those lines.
[doctor]  Okay, that's good. Do you know anybody in your family that has had kidney stones in the past?
[patient]  Y'all and my family has had kidney stones in the past.
[doctor]  No, well they didn't set you up good, did they?
[patient]  Yeah, I guess I can blame them, but it's been an issue with the family for as long as I've been aware of.
[doctor]  Okay, alright. And I'm reading here. It looks like you've had them before as well, right?
[patient]  I have yet passed by myself and I've had to have surgery a couple of times as well.
[doctor]  Okay, so the ones that you passed by yourself, how many days would you say it would take to the pass?
[patient]  Usually within within a week, I manage to get them out.
[doctor]  Okay, alright, so you got anything fun planned for the weekend.
[patient]  Just getting this pain under control.
[doctor]  Okay, well that sounds like a good plan. We can definitely help you out with that. All right, so I'm going to do a quick physical exam on you looks like your blood pressure is a little bit elevated. And I think that's probably because you're in pain. And that's understandable. Everything else looks fine. So on pressing on your abdomen, does that hurt?
[patient]  No, no, no, pain.
[doctor]  Alright so press here in the back and your CV-8 does that back here in.
[patient]  Yeah, it's a little tender, yeah, it's a little tender.
[doctor]  Okay, so on your physical exam, there seems to be no tenderness to palpation of your abdomen. There is CVA tenderness on your right side here, and that's due to that kidney stone. So we did get a CT scan before you came in, so it does show that you have a stone measuring .5 centimeters in size located on the proximal right-your-reader. So that's that duct that passes from your kidney to your bladder. I don't see any evidence of high-flonophrosis, so there is nothing obstructing causing. Swelling in your kidney, so that's good to hear. So I don't think you hopefully won't need any surgery for this one. So let's talk a bit a little bit about on my assessment and plan, so you know you've done this a couple of times you have that kidney stone. So what I want you to do is just have you continue to push fluids, and hopefully we can pass the stone, your pain, your pain, you're doing okay right now, so I'm just going to continue you on that. I'd be profan. Do you think that's that's working you said? For you.
[patient]  So far so good, but since the weekend is coming around, I rather have something stronger if it's possible.
[doctor]  Okay, so I can prescribe you some tram at all you know that should help 50 milligrams that should help you out If you do have any of that pain if you get any breakthrough pain from that you can take that ibuprofen It should help you know with everything and hopefully you can get through that weekend I know you went to your PCP prior to coming to see me. Did they give you a strainer?
[patient]  Did it they did yet? I bet I've been using that, but so far nothing.
[doctor]  Okay, so continue to use the strainer whenever you urinate. So hopefully we can catch the stone. I'm also going to order a BMP, a urinalysis, and urine culture. And based on what that shows, we can see if we need to put you on any antibiotics. I don't think you have an infection, but you know there is that possibility. And then I want to see you again in one to two weeks if you're still having symptoms. And if you know you still have the stone with you, we can talk about further treatment possible. Lithotripsy, you know that's the shockwave treatment. I'm pretty sure you've had that prior too.
[patient]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's what I want.
[doctor]  What that is okay, so do you have any other questions for me?
[patient]  No I'm Friend.
[doctor]  Alright, so I'll see you again in two weeks. I'll have my nurse come in and bring you that prescription for the tramital and I think we are all good.
[patient]  Perfect, thank you.

Right flank pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Joshua Reyes is a pleasant 18-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for evaluation of right flank pain.

For the last 2 weeks, the patient has been experiencing pain that starts in his right flank and radiates down into his groin. He also recalls one episode in which the pain radiated down into one of his testicles. Although his pain is intermittent depending on his fluid intake and activity level, he rates the pain as a 4/10 at its worst. Otherwise, the pain is a 1-2/10. He denies any pain with urination, hematuria, nausea, vomiting, or fevers, but recalls possibly having chills at one point. Over-the-counter ibuprofen provides partial relief of his pain. Of note, the patient has a personal history of kidney stones, some which were passed independently, usually within a week, while others required surgical intervention or lithotripsy. He also has several family members with a histories of kidney stones.

MEDICAL HISTORY

The patient has a personal history of kidney stones treated conservatively, surgically, and with lithotripsy.

FAMILY HISTORY

The patient has a significant family history of kidney stones.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Constitutional: Reports chills. Denies fever
Gastrointestinal: Denies nausea or vomiting.
Genitourinary: Reports right flank pain. Denies dysuria or hematuria.

VITALS

Blood pressure: Slightly elevated

PHYSICAL EXAM

GI/GU: No tenderness to palpation of the abdomen.
MSK: Examination of the right flank: CVA tenderness.

RESULTS

CT scan of the right flank was reviewed today, 05/06/2022. It revealed a kidney stone measuring 0.5 cm in size, located on the proximal right ureter. There is no evidence of hydronephrosis.

ASSESSMENT

Kidney stone, right side.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and CT scan findings today, we discussed the diagnosis and treatment plan. I recommend that we treat the patient conservatively at this point. I advised him to continue drinking plenty of fluids so he can hopefully pass the stone. He has been controlling his pain with over-the-counter ibuprofen and should continue to do so. I also prescribed tramadol 50 mg for any breakthrough pain. His primary care physician provided him with a strainer and I advised him to continue using this as well. I want to order a BMP, a urinalysis, and a urine culture to rule out any need for antibiotics. We will have him follow up in 2 weeks for re-evaluation. If he has not passed the kidney stone at that time, we can consider proceeding with lithotripsy.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up in 2 weeks."
aci,D2N207,"[doctor]  Hi, Frank, how are you? I heard the medical assistant told me that you're having some shortness of breath.
[patient]  I am I am I am okay, I am not great.
[doctor]  You are okay. You are not great. Okay. Well, how long have you been having some shortness of breath?
[patient]  It's been about a week.
[doctor]  It's been about a week okay, now have you ever experienced these symptoms before?
[patient]  Yeah, this happened about six months ago and I came in and they changed my lay six dose and I seem to get better.
[doctor]  Okay, all right, so let's talk a little bit about that. Now I know that you have a history of coronary disease. You know you had had a heart attack back in 2018. We put that stent in your right coronary artery. I know that the pumping function of your heart was a little low, you know, that what we call that ejection fraction was about 35 percent. Have you been watching your salt intake?
[patient]  Yeah, but you know it's been the holidays the last couple of weeks and you know we've had a bunch of family get together and I don't think my diet has been everything it should have been.
[doctor]  Okay, all right now, have you noticed any swelling in your legs?
[patient]  Yes, definitely.
[doctor]  Okay, and are you taking the LASIX? Now I know that we had increased it to about 40 milligrams once a day are you taking it?
[patient]  Yeah, I take it every day.
[doctor]  You take it every day, okay? Do you notice that you're urinating any less recently?
[patient]  No, it seems about the same.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  You know I urinate at night, you know at least once, sometimes twice a night, that's a little more what happened before.
[doctor]  Okay, all right, and do you feel short of breath at rest or is it mostly when you're just walking around?
[patient]  Walking around stairs in, particular walking quickly.
[doctor]  Okay, and how about when you're sleeping at night are you able to lay flat or do you have to sit up a little bit?
[patient]  I gone from 1 pillow to 2 pillows.
[doctor]  Okay, all right. And do you ever wake up really short of breath? Does it ever wake you up?
[patient]  It did that six months ago, it has not done that so far this time.
[doctor]  Okay, alright now, tell me a little bit about when was the last time you saw your nephrologist.
[patient]  About a month ago.
[doctor]  Okay, because as you know, we do talk about the fact that you have some kidney dysfunction about stage 3, so it's going to be important for you to continue to follow up with your kidney doctor. Now, are you how are you doing staying away from things like Motrin and Advel I know that you had had some knee pain in the past? And do you know how are you doing staying away from those medications?
[patient]  Everybody is told me not to use it, so I don't accept when I have pretty bad pain, I had an episode about a week ago some pain in my feet actually, and I had to take motion to get rid of it. So yeah, I took motion for a while and I stopped as quickly as I could.
[doctor]  Okay, now are you able to take Tylenol? Do not feel any relief from Tylenol when you take it.
[patient]  Yet Tylenol's lovely, it just is not very effective.
[doctor]  Okay, alright, yeah, because I think we really want you to stay away from that those anti-inflammatories because that can make your kidney function worse, and obviously you know we don't want to see you go on dialysis, or anything like that, so we'll have.
[patient]  mean neither.
[doctor]  Right, so we'll have to you know really work on that. Now tell me a little bit about are you watching the potassium and stuff in your diet.
[patient]  Nobody's really talked to me about that so.
[doctor]  Okay, yeah, so you want?
[patient]  I didn't know what high potassium foods are.
[doctor]  Okay, I'm sorry I've never talked to you about that in the past, I that's my fault. So yeah, so you want to make sure you stay away from things like bananas, oranges, you know, potatoes have lots of potassium that type of thing. And so you know because with your kidney function, you know that can cause your potassium levels to go up because you don't get rid of the potassium, as you should you know.
[patient]  something to eat.
[doctor]  What's that?
[patient]  Is there anything left? Is there anything left over that I can't eat?
[doctor]  So yet you can eat you know how about this, how about we give you a a referral to a dietician and they can help you with that.
[patient]  Sound good.
[doctor]  Now are you watching the NBA playoff should I? Or should I not bring that up by? Is that a sensitive subject? I mean, I'm a self-expand. And we did sweep the nuts so.
[patient]  Yep, well I mean that's fan and I couldn't sleep last night, but you know.
[doctor]  Okay, well maybe we shouldn't talk about.
[patient]  Kinda used to it, you know where they were the favorite to win and then like that.
[doctor]  Yeah, I know I, I, I will say I think Jason Tatum and Jalen Brown paid played phenomenally. So I do think that they help with the cell fix over the edge. So, but that's all we'll talk about that what's that.
[patient]  I said, you're too bad they did.
[doctor]  Yeah, all right. Well, I want to just go ahead and do a quick physical exam on you. Okay. So, you know, looking at your vital signs here in the office, you know, your blood pressure is about 135 over 80. So it's not too bad. And maybe like to see it a little bit lower. I'm just going to be calling out my physical exam findings. And I'm going to let you know what they mean when I'm done. Okay. So on your neck exam, I appreciate some jugular venous distension up to about nine centimeters there. Are no carotid brews on your lung exam. I do appreciate by basil or crackles with occasional ronkey that clears when you cough on your heart exam. I do appreciate a three out of six systolic ejection murmur heard of the left base. And on your lower extremity exam, I do appreciate one to two plus putting a Dima bilaterally. So, Frank, what does that mean? All that means is that you have findings on you that suggest that you're attaining fluid. Now we'll have to talk a little bit about how we're going to address that. Okay. So I want to just go over a little bit about my assessment and my plan for you. Okay. So for the for your first problem of your shortness of breath, I do believe you're having an acute heart failure exacerbation. So I want to go ahead and increase your lay six from 40 milligrams a day to 80 milligrams a day. And I wanted to call me in two days. And let me know how your weight has been with increasing the diuretic now. If you start to have worsening shortness of breath before that I want you to yeah, call me. We may have to admit you to the hospital for some intravenous diuretics. Okay. I also want to go ahead and just obtain new consideration as I want to know this. My desire to be finished as I try to change the range of medical management, you know. As much as I do, you have since I Kraib Nor Bonner, I really would love it if you would continue you needed me who would have experienced your
[patient]  Salt on Lasix all at once and I take it all at once or do I divide it up.
[doctor]  How about you start taking the the increased dose in the morning and then we'll see how you do and if necessary I'll have to add a second dose in the afternoon that you can take around for a clock in the afternoon I don't want you to take it too late at night because then you will be going to the bathroom all night okay
[patient]  That sounds correct.
[doctor]  So I also want to go ahead and order a chest x-ray just to make sure that we are not missing anything else okay for your second problem of your coronary artery disease. You know it sounds like you're doing well except for this heart failure exacerbation. So I want to go ahead and order another echocardiogram to check out that heart murmur that I hear on your physical exam just to make sure that that's not getting any worse and to make sure that the pumping function of your heart is stable and I'm going to go ahead and call Dr. White and let them know that I want you to be seen by them okay and then for your third problem of your stage three chronic kidney disease I want you to go ahead and try to know don't please don't take any more motrin or adval I do want you to try to stick with Tylenol and if you're still having a significant problem with some pain I want you to call me and we'll talk about some alternative medications that we can use or therapies okay I will also want to go ahead and order a complete metabolic panel just to make sure that your kidney function is stable does that sound okay
[patient]  That sounds good. Do you have any idea what was going on with my foot pain before?
[doctor]  Well how long have you been having it? How long you've been having that foot pain?
[patient]  That's why I took the motron at last, did you know, four, five days slowly went away.
[doctor]  It wasn't both of your feet.
[patient]  One.
[doctor]  One, and where in your foot was was it?
[patient]  just in front of the big toe.
[doctor]  Just in front of the big toe. Okay, have you ever had a history of gout?
[patient]  Nobody has told me about that.
[doctor]  Okay, all right. Well, it sounds like it could have been gout, you know, with your chronic kidneys, chronic kidney disease, it's a possibility. So for this possible gout flare for your fourth problem of your possible gout flare, let's go ahead. I want to just go ahead and order a uric acid just to see and it's something that we can talk about there is an alternative medication that you can take with your kidney function that that wouldn't hurt at that one. injure it any further and I think it would work just the same.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Okay, any other questions?
[patient]  This is long as you think I'm gonna get better.
[doctor]  I think you're going to get better. Yes, I think we're going to, you know, I really want you to watch your salt intake. And I'm going to go ahead and order that dietary dietitian referral so that you can get your diet under control, but you really have to watch your salt intake. I think that that's kind of what this heart failure exacerbation is about, maybe a little dietary in discretion.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Okay, anything else?
[patient]  You know that's good thank you.
[doctor]  Okay, you're welcome by.","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Cardiovascular
- Auscultation of Heart: 3 out of 6 systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base.

Musculoskeletal
- Examination of the lower extremities: 1 to 2+ pitting edema bilaterally.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Acute heart failure exacerbation.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient’s physical examination today suggests he is retaining fluid. His shortness of breath is also the result of an acute heart failure exacerbation. His recent dietary indiscretion may have contributed to this development.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I explained to the patient that he should increase his diuretic in the morning so that any increased urinary frequency will not interrupt his sleep at night. I encouraged the patient to limit his salt intake.
- Medical Treatment: The patient will increase his Lasix from 40 mg a day to 80 mg a day. We will see how he does with the increased dose in the morning before adding a second increased dose in the afternoon. Chest x-ray ordered to rule out any other etiologies.

2. Coronary artery disease.
- Medical Reasoning: He is doing well except for the heart failure exacerbation.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I advised the patient to limit his intake of salty foods.
- Medical Treatment: Repeat echocardiogram ordered for further evaluation of the heart murmur heard on his physical exam. I am going to call Dr. White and let them know that I want him to be seen by them.

3. Stage 3 chronic kidney disease.
- Medical Reasoning: This appears to be stable.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I reminded the patient it is important to routinely follow up with his nephrologist. I advised him that he should limit intake of any potassium rich foods including bananas, oranges, and potatoes as they can affect his kidney function. I also recommended he avoid the use of any anti-inflammatories such as Motrin or Advil as they can contribute to worsening kidney function. If his pain does not resolve with Tylenol, I want him to call me, and we can discuss some alternative medications or therapies.
- Medical Treatment: The patient was provided with a referral to a dietician for assistance with his dietary needs. Tylenol can be taken for pain. Complete metabolic panel is ordered to ensure kidney function is stable.

4. Possible gout flare.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient’s recent great toe pain may have been a possible gout flare related to his chronic kidney disease.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I explained that there is an alternative medication he could take to protect his kidney function that would not result in a gout flare.
- Medical Treatment: Uric acid test ordered.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

INSTRUCTIONS

I want him to call me in 2 days and let me know how his weight has been with increasing the diuretic. If he starts to have worsening shortness of breath in the next 2 days, I recommend he call me as we may have to admit him to the hospital for intravenous diuretics."
