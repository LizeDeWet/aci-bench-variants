"[doctor]  Hi, Andrew. How are you?
[patient]  Hey, good to see you.
[doctor]  I'm doing well. I'm doing well.
[patient]  Good.
[doctor]  So I know the nurse told you about DAX. I'd like to tell DAX a little bit about you.
[patient]  Sure.
[doctor]  So, Andrew is a 59-year-old male with a past medical history, significant for depression, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension who presents today with an upper respiratory infection. So, Andrew, what's going on?
[patient]  Yeah, we were doing a bit of workout in the yard in the last week or so and I started to feel really tired with short of breath. We were not wearing masks as much at the end of the summer and I think I caught my first cold and I think it just got worse.
[doctor]  Okay, all right. Now, have you had your COVID vaccines?
[patient]  Yeah both.
[doctor]  Okay, alright. And do you have any history of any seasonal allergies at all?
[patient]  None whatsoever.
[doctor]  Okay, alright. And when you say you're having some shortness of breath, did you feel short of breath walking around or at rest?
[patient]  Usually it was lifting or carrying something. We were doing some landscaping, so I was carrying some heavy bags of soil and I got really winded. It really surprised me.
[doctor]  Okay. And are you coughing up anything?
[patient]  Not yet, but I feel like that's next.
[doctor]  Okay, and fevers?
[patient]  uh... i felt a little warm but i i just thought it was because i was exerting myself
[doctor]  Okay, alright. And any other symptoms like muscle aches, joint pain fatigue?
[patient]  My elbows hurt quite a bit and my knees were pretty tired. Like I said, I really felt some tension around my knees, but I think I was a lot to do with lifting the bags.
[doctor]  Okay, all right. Um, so, you know, how about how are you doing in terms of your other medical problems like your depression? How are you doing with that? I know we've, you know, talked about not putting you on medication for it because you're on medication for other things. What's going on?
[patient]  It's been kind of a crazy year and a half. I was a little concerned about that, but for the most part, I've been doing well with it. My wife got me into bar classes to help me relax and I think it's working.
[doctor]  Okay, all right, great. And in terms of your diabetes, how are you doing watching your diet and your sugar intake?
[patient]  I've been monitoring my sugar levels while I'm going to work during the week. Not so. If it's Saturday or Sunday, I usually don't remember. The diet's been pretty good for most part, except for some house parties and things like that. But, been good for the most part.
[doctor]  Okay, and have they been elevated at all since this episode of your?
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Okay, and then how lastly, for your high blood pressure, have you been monitoring your blood pressures at home? Did you buy the cuff like I suggested?
[patient]  Uh, same thing. During the while I'm gonna work, I'm regular about monitoring it, but if it's a Saturday or Sunday, not so much. But, uh, it's been under control.
[doctor]  But you're taking your medication?
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  Okay, all right. Well, you know, I know that, you know, you've endorsed, you know, the shortness of breath and some joint pain. How about any other symptoms? Nausea or vomiting? Diarrhea?
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Anything like that?
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Okay, all right. Well, I want to go ahead and do a quick physical exam. All right? Hey, Dragon, show me the vital signs. So your vital signs here in the office look quite good.
[patient]  MM
[doctor]  You know, everything's looking normal. You don't have a fever, which is really good. I'm just gonna go ahead and listen to your heart and your lungs and kind of I'll let you know what I hear, okay?
[patient]  Sure.
[doctor]  Okay, so on your physical exam, you know, your heart sounds nice and strong. Your lungs, you do have scattered raunchy bilaterally on your lung exam. It clears with cough. I do notice a little bit of some edema of your lower extremities, and you do have some pain to palpation of your elbows bilaterally. So let's go ahead. I want to look at some of your results, okay?
[patient]  MM
[doctor]  Hey, Dragon. Show me the chest X-ray.
[doctor]  So, I reviewed the results of your chest x-ray and everything looks good. There's no airspace disease, there's no pneumonia, so that's all very, very good, okay?
[patient]  Good.
[doctor]  Hey Dragon. Show me the diabetic labs.
[doctor]  And here, looking at your diabetic labs, you know, your hemoglobin A1C is a little elevated at 8.
[patient]  MM
[doctor]  I'd like to see that a little bit better around 6 or 7 if possible.
[patient]  MM
[doctor]  So let's talk a little bit about my assessment and my plan for you.
[patient]  MM
[doctor]  So, for your first problem, this upper respiratory infection, I believe you have a viral syndrome, okay? We'll go ahead and we'll send a COVID test just to make sure that you don't have COVID.
[patient]  MM
[doctor]  But overall, I think that, you know, this will resolve in a couple of days. I don't think you have COVID. You don't have any exposures, that type of thing.
[patient]  MM
[doctor]  So, I think that this will improve. I'll give you some robotusin for your cough, and I would encourage you to take some ibuprofen, Tylenol for any fever, okay?
[patient]  You got it.
[doctor]  For your next problem, your depression, you know, it sounds like you're doing well with that, but again, I'm happy to start on a med. A medical regimen or...
[patient]  MM
[doctor]  Refer you to psychotherapy if you think that that would be helpful.
[patient]  MM
[doctor]  Would you like that?
[patient]  You, you, um, maybe not necessarily. Maybe in a, uh, a few months, we'll check on that.
[doctor]  Okay. Alright.
[doctor]  For your third problem, your Type 2 diabetes I want to go ahead and increase your metform into 1000 milligrams twice daily.
[patient]  MM
[doctor]  And I'm going to get in another hemoglobin A1c in four months, okay?
[patient]  Okay, sure.
[doctor]  Hey Dragon, order a hemoglobin A1c.
[doctor]  And lastly, for your high blood pressure, it looks like you're doing a really good job managing that. I want to go ahead and continue you on the licinipral 20 milligrams a day.
[patient]  MM
[doctor]  And I'm going to go ahead and order a lipid panel, okay?
[patient]  Sure.
[doctor]  Do you need a refill of the Lycein April?
[patient]  Actually I do.
[doctor]  Okay. Hey, Dragon. Order license April 20 milligrams daily.
[doctor]  So the nurse will be in, she'll help you make a follow-up appointment with me. I want to see you again in about four months.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Let me know if your symptoms worsen and we can talk more about it, okay?
[patient]  You got it.
[doctor]  Alright, Hey Dragon, finalize the note.","ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

"[doctor]  Hi Andrea, how are you?

[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  So, Andrea is a 52-year-old female with a past medical history significant for rheumatoid arthritis, atrial fibrillation, and reflux who presents today for her annual exam. So, Andrea, it's been a year since I saw you. How are you doing?
[patient]  I'm doing well. So, I've been walking like you told me to, and exercising and doing yoga. And that's actually help with my arthritis a lot, just the constant movement. So I haven't had any joint pain recently.
[doctor]  Okay, good. So no, no issues with any stiffness or pain or flare-ups over the last year.
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Okay, and I know that we have you on the metatrexate, are you still taking that once a week?
[patient]  Yes, I am.
[doctor]  Okay, and any issues with that?
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  No, okay. And then in terms of your A-Fib, how are you doing with that? Are you having any palpitations? Or I know that you've kind of been in and out of it over the past, you know, year or so.
[patient]  Yeah, I've still been having palpitations. The last one I had was about a week ago. I've noticed that when I start to get stressed, they start to flare up again. So I've been trying meditation, trying running with my dog to try and relieve the stress, but it hasn't really been working.
[doctor]  Yeah, I know that you had called last month and we did that event monitor for you, which will take a look at in a few minutes. Okay?
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  How about your reflux? We had placed you on the prognix. Has that helped? And I know that you were going to do some dietary modifications.
[patient]  Yeah, I cut out soda in that. That's helped seem to help and the medication's been helping too. I haven't had to flare up and over I think five months.
[doctor]  Okay, all right. So, you know, I know that you did the review of system sheet when you checked in and, you know, you had, you know, you endorsed the palpitations and you had some nasal congestion. Any other symptoms? You know chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea or vomiting.
[patient]  No, nothing like that. Just the nasal nasal congestion because of my allergies.
[doctor]  Okay, all right. Okay. Well, I'd like to go ahead and do a quick physical exam, okay?
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  All right. Hey dragon show me the vital signs. Okay, so you're in here in the office today. It looks like you know your heart rate's really good today. It's it's nice and controlled so that's good. I'm just going to take a look into your heart and lungs and and I'll let you know what I find. Okay.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Okay, so on physical examination, you know, everything looks really good. On your heart examination, I do appreciate a slight two-six systolic, systolic ejection murmur, which we've heard in the past, so I'm not worried at that. You're in the nice regular rate and rhythm at this time. Your lungs are nice and clear. On your right elbow, I do notice some edema and some erythema. Does it hurt when I press it?
[patient]  Yeah, it does a bit.
[doctor]  Okay, so she is paying to palpation of the right elbow and you have no lower extremity edema, okay? So I want to go ahead and just take a look at some of your results. Okay?
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Hey, Dragon, show me the event, event monitor results. Okay. So, you know, this is the results of your event monitor, which shows that, you know, you're in and out of A-Fib, you have what we call a conversion pause. You know, you're in A-Fib, you pause, and then you go back to regular rhythm. So, we'll talk about that, okay?
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Hey dragon, show me the autoimmune panel. So looking here at your autoimmune panel, everything looks good, it looks like you know, everything is well controlled with your rheumatoid arthritis on the methotrexate. Okay? So let me just go over a little bit about my assessment and my plan for you. Okay?
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  So for your first problem, your rheumatoid arthritis, again, everything looks good. I want to just continue you on the Methatrexate 2.5 milligrams once weekly. And if you need a referral back to see the rheumatologist, let me know, but I think everything seems stable now. Do you need a refill of the Methatrexate?
[patient]  Yes, I do.
[doctor]  Okay. Hey, dragon, order methotrexate, 2.5 milligrams once weekly. For your second problem, the atrial fibrillation. So you're going in and out of A-fib, and I'd like to just keep you in normal sinus rhythm. So I want to go ahead and refer you to cardiology for a cardiac ablation, which just maps out where that rhythm is coming from and burns it, so it doesn't come back. Okay? You're young. We want to keep you in a normal rhythm and being that you're going in and out of A-fib, I think that's what we should do. Okay?
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Hey, dragon, order a referral to cardiology. And for your last problem, the reflux, I want you to just continue on the prognics, 40 milligrams a day. Continue with your dietary modifications, avoiding coffee and spicy foods, that type of thing. Okay? And then let me know if you have any other issues with that. Okay?
[patient]  어때요?

"[doctor]  Hi Albert. How are you?
[patient]  Hey, good to see you.
[doctor]  It's good to see you too. So I know the nurse told you about DAX. I'd like to tell DAX a little bit about you.
[patient]  Sure.
[doctor]  So, Albert is a 62-year-old male with a past medical history significant for depression, type 2 diabetes and kidney transplant, who is here today for emergency room follow-up.
[patient]  MM
[doctor]  So, I got a notification that you were in the emergency room, but what were you there for?
[patient]  Well, I wasn't really staying on top of my blood sugar readings and I felt kind of woozy over the weekend. And I was a little concerned and my wife wanted to take me in and just have me checked out.
[doctor]  Okay, and was it in fact high?
[patient]  Yeah it was.
[doctor]  Okay. Did you, were you admitted to the hospital?
[patient]  Oh no.
[doctor]  Okay, alright. And uh, are you did they see a reason as to why it was elevated?
[patient]  Oh yeah, my mother was actually in the hospital the last week. She had a bit of a fall and had to do a hip replacement. She's feeling better now, but we have been just grabbing meals at the cafeteria or picking up fast food on our way home and I just really wasn't monitoring what I was eating.
[doctor]  Okay, that's sorry to hear. And are you feeling better now?
[patient]  uh... actually when we got home from the uh... from a visit i felt a lot better
[doctor]  Okay, and since then, have you been following your diet pretty closely?
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  Okay, cause we don't want to end up in the hospital too.
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  All right, um, okay, and so before that happened, how are you doing with your diet?
[patient]  Uh, during the week, I've been fine because I've been very busy on the weekends doing things. You're seeing people, you're having people over. It's sign up. Not as consistent on the weekend.
[doctor]  Okay, all right. Is there a way that you think that that can improve?
[patient]  A S, stop eating.
[doctor]  Okay. Alright. Well, let's talk about your kidney transplant. How are?
[patient]  MM
[doctor]  You doing? You're taking immunotherapy meds?
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  Yeah, I've been pretty diligent about it following doctor's orders so it's been pretty good so far
[doctor]  Okay, and why? The last time I saw that you saw Dr. Reyes was about three weeks ago and everything seemed to be fine.
[patient]  That's correct.
[doctor]  Your kidney function is good.
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  Okay, alright. And in terms of your depression, how are you? How are you doing?
[patient]  And it's been about a tough, uh, year and a half or so, but I've been pretty good with it. I have my moments, but I, as long as I find some time to relax at least in the afternoon, then, then it seems to work out okay.
[doctor]  Okay, so I know that we've kind of talked about holding off on medical therapy.
[patient]  MM
[doctor]  Cause you're on so many other meds.
[patient]  MM
[doctor]  Is that something that you want to revisit or do you want to look into therapy or do you think anything's needed right now?
[patient]  I think I probably want to shy away from any therapy. My wife got me in a meditation recently and I find that relaxing. So I think I'd like to continue that, at least for a couple more months and see how it goes.
[doctor]  Okay. Alright. That sounds good. Alright. Well, I know the nurse did a quick review of systems with you, when you-
[patient]  MM
[doctor]  Checked in. Do you have any symptoms, any chest pain or shortness of breath?

[doctor]  Okay, so on your physical exam, everything looks really good. Um, you don't appear in any distress at this time. I don't appreciate any carotid broods. Your heart, on your heart exam, I do hear that slight two-six systolic ejection murmur, but we heard that in the past.
[patient]  MM
[doctor]  Your lungs sound nice and clear, but I notice, you know, one plus a Dima in your lower extremities. Okay?

[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  Okay. How about when I bend your arm?
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  Okay. That's pretty tender.
[patient]  MM
[doctor]  How about when I go backwards like that?
[patient]  Not as much.
[doctor]  And how about when I flex like this?
[patient]  A little.
[doctor]  But mostly when I do that type of motion.
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  Okay, great. So you have pain following hitting your arm on the net. On your exam, you definitely have some tenderness over your distal radius. On your arm, you have pain when I stress especially your thumb and and flex your thumb. So I think what you have is basically just a strain and maybe a contusion to that muscle from hitting it. You certainly don't have a fracture. I think at this point we're really going to treat it actually conservatively. We'll have you use ice for the pain and swelling and some anti-inflammatory. What we'll do is give you some Motrin 800 milligrams three times a day with food. If it doesn't get any better in the next week or so, let me know and we'll take a look at you again.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Okay, great. Hey, Dragon, go ahead and order the procedures and the medications as discussed. Why don't you come with me? Dragon, you can finalize the note.
[patient]  Thank you.","IMPRESSION

Right wrist sprain.

PLAN

At this point, I discussed the diagnosis and treatment options with the patient. I have recommended ice and anti-inflammatory medications. I am prescribing Motrin, 800 mg to take 3 times a day with food. She will follow up with me in 1 week or as needed.

"[doctor]  Hey Lawrence, how are you?
[patient]  Hey, good to see you.
[doctor]  It's good to see you too. So I know the nurse told you about DAX.
[patient]  MM
[doctor]  I'd like to tell Docs a little bit about you.
[patient]  Sure.
[doctor]  So, Lawrence is a 62-year-old male with a past medical history significant for type-by-diabetes, congestive heart failure, depression, and reflux who presents with complaints of shortness of breath. So, Lawrence, what's been going on? Double-h, what's wrong with your breathing?
[patient]  I've noticed that I've been swelling up a little bit. I think a lot of it has to do with going to some house parties, eating some salty foods. I feel really lethargic.
[doctor]  Okay, alright. And when you get short of breath, are you short of breath when you're just sitting here? Do you feel short of breath when you're walking?
[patient]  It's something like walking up a flight of stairs. I'll actually feel it.
[doctor]  Okay, all right. Now, how long has this been going on for?
[patient]  Probably about 10 days.
[doctor]  Okay, alright. And you said you noticed some swelling in your legs?
[patient]  A little bit.
[doctor]  Okay. Do you have problems lying flat and bed?
[patient]  I'm a little uncomfortable when I wake up in the morning and I feel pretty stiff and like it takes me a little while to adjust to walking when I get up.
[doctor]  Okay. Alright. Do you ever wake up a cutely short of breath at night?
[patient]  um... it happened once probably about a week ago but it hasn't happened since so i haven't been that concerned about it
[doctor]  Okay, alright. In terms of your diabetes, how are you doing with that? I know you're on the insulin pump.
[patient]  MM
[doctor]  Are your blood sugars okay? Have you noticed a spike in them recently?
[patient]  Um, I haven't. I've been pretty good about monitoring it so during the working week I stay on top of that. But on Saturdays or Sundays, we're so busy I forget to monitor it. But I haven't seen anything spike.
[doctor]  Okay, and I remember your affinity for chocolate bars, so...
[patient]  Guilty is charged. I love chocolate bars.
[doctor]  Okay, alright. So in terms of your depression, how are you doing with that?
[patient]  It's been a crazy year and a half. I've tried some natural solutions. In the summer I did stretches outdoors every morning, which was great, but now the weather changed and I've got to find some alternatives. I'm not ready to try any medications just yet. So...
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  I'm open to some suggestions.
[doctor]  Okay, we'll talk about that.
[patient]  Sure.
[doctor]  And then in terms of your reflux, how are you doing? I know we had you on the Omeppersol.
[patient]  MM
[doctor]  You are making some lifestyle modifications, cutting back on your red bull and caffeine.
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  Alcohol intake has been, how's that been?
[patient]  Tufter in holiday season, but I'm, I'm better.
[doctor]  Okay, alright. And no issues with your depression. You don't want to hurt yourself or anyone else.
[patient]  No, no, absolutely not.
[doctor]  Okay, all right. Well, let's go ahead. I know you did a review of System Sheet when you checked in, and you endorsed the shortness of breath.
[patient]  MM
[doctor]  Any other symptoms? Chest pain, fever, chills, cough?
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Um, selfie, resides e vem úTC em essaitchens!
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Okay, let's go ahead. I want to move on to a physical exam.
[patient]  MM
[doctor]  Hey, Dragon, show me the vital signs. So here in the office, you know, your vital signs look good. Your pulse ox, that's your oxygenation level. Looks good. So I'm encouraged by that with you just sitting here, okay? I'm going to go ahead and do another, uh, just check you over. I'll let you know what I find.
[patient]  MM
[doctor]  Okay, all right. So on your exam things look okay. So I don't appreciate any jugular venous distension or any carotid brews on your neck exam. On your heart exam, I do appreciate a slight three out of six systolic ejection murmur. On your lung exam, I do appreciate some crackles bilaterally at the bases. And on your lower extremity exam, I do appreciate one plus pitting a dima. So what does all that mean? So I do think that you're attaining some fluid. It's probably from some of the dietary and discretion.
[patient]  MM
[doctor]  But I want to go ahead and look at some of the results. Okay? I had the nurse do a chest x-ray on you before we came in, okay? Hey, dragon, show me the test x-ray. So I reviewed the results of your chest x-ray, and it looks good. There's no e evidence of any airspace disease, but that doesn't mean that you still can't be retaining some fluid, okay?
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Hey, dragon, show me the labs. And your labs look okay. You know, you don't have an elevated white blood cell count. So I'm not really concerned about infection. We saw the chest x-ray. There's no pneumonia, so that's good.
[patient]  MM
[doctor]  So let's talk a little bit about my assessment and my plan for you. Okay? So for your first problem of your shortness of breath, I think that you are in an acute heart failure exacerbation. I want to go ahead and put you on some Lasix, 40 milligrams a day. I want you to weigh yourself every day.
[patient]  MM
[doctor]  If your weight isn't going down or if it's going up, I want you to call me. Certainly, if you get more short of breath at rest, I want you to go ahead and call me or call 9-11.
[patient]  MM
[doctor]  and go into the emergency room. You might need some intravenous diuretics.
[patient]  MM
[doctor]  Okay, for your second problem of your type-by-dia beades. Let's go ahead. I want to order a hemoglobin A1c4 just in a month or so just to see if we have to make any adjustments. And I want you to follow up with your endocrinologist. Okay, and I also want to make sure that you have a recent eye exam. All right, for your third problem of your depression, let's go ahead and refer you to psychiatry just for some like talk therapy to help you through that. Okay.
[patient]  Sure.
[doctor]  No medications. And for your fourth problem of your reflux, let's go ahead and continue you on the Omeppresol, 20 milligrams a day. Do you have any questions, Lawrence?
[patient]  Not this point.
[doctor]  Okay, um, uh, again, I want you to call me if you have any problems with your breathing, okay?
[patient]  You got it.
[doctor]  Hey Dragon, finalize the notes.","ASSESSMENT

"[doctor]  Hey MS James, nice to meet you.
[patient]  Nice to meet you, Dr. Cooper. How are you?
[doctor]  I'm well. Hey, dragon. I'm seeing MS James. She's a 42-year-old female and what brings you in today?
[patient]  I hurt my finger when I was skiing this past weekend.
[doctor]  Really?
[patient]  Yeah, yeah, so I was going downhill double diamonds, double black diamonds, and I just lost control and I you know flipped down a few ways, but somewhere along the way I jam my index finger on something. I'm not sure what.
[doctor]  Okay, so this happened last Saturday, you said?
[patient]  It was Saturday, yes.
[doctor]  Okay, so about five days of this right index finger pain.
[patient]  MM
[doctor]  Have you taken any medicine for it?
[patient]  I took some ibuprofen. Didn't really seem to help.
[doctor]  Okay. Have you iced it or put a splint on it?
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Okay. And what would you rate your pain?
[patient]  It's about a seven.
[doctor]  A 7 out of 10 paint. Um, and no other injuries while you went down this double black diamond?
[patient]  No, interestingly enough, this is the only one.
[doctor]  Okay. Well, I guess you escaped, I mean.
[patient]  Could have been much worse.
[doctor]  could have been much worse, yes. So do you have any medical problems?
[patient]  um... yeah i'm i have chronic constipation
[doctor]  Do you take any medicine for it?
[patient]  Miral Axe.
[doctor]  and does that help.
[patient]  Seems to flow nicely.
[doctor]  Good for you.
[doctor]  Have you ever had any surgeries before?
[patient]  Yes, I had my appendix out when I was seven.
[doctor]  Okay, let's look at your x-ray together. Hey, Dragon, show me the last x-ray. Alright, so looking at your right hand here, and that index finger looks great. So all the joints, bones are in the right places, no fractures, so you've got a normal right-hand x-ray. Let's go ahead and check your finger out. Now, does it hurt when I push on your finger like this?
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  Does it hurt when I pull your finger like this?
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  Does it hurt when I squeeze over this joint here?
[patient]  Yes, please don't do that.
[doctor]  Does it hurt when I squeeze over this?
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  Okay, so with your x-ray and with your exam, looks like you have a sprain of your distar, distal, inner-falanjial joint. It's called your dip joint of your right index finger, and so what we're going to do for that is we're going to put a splint on that right finger. I'm going to give you a strong anti-inflammatory called Mobyk. You'll take 15 milligrams once a day. I'll prescribe 14 of those for you. And I want you to come back and see me in two weeks, and let's make sure it's all healed up. And if we need to start any hand therapy at that point, then we can. Do you have any questions for me?
[patient]  No questions. Thank you.
[doctor]  You're welcome. Hey, Dragon, order the medications and procedures mentioned. And why don't you come with me and we'll get you checked out.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Hey, Dragon, finalize the report.","IMPRESSION

Right index finger DIP joint sprain.

At this point, I discussed the diagnosis and treatment options with the patient. I have recommended a splint. A prescription is provided for Mobic 15 mg once a day, dispense 14. She will follow up with me in 2 weeks for a repeat evaluation. If she is unimproved, we will consider hand therapy at that time. All questions were answered.

"[doctor]  Hi Cheryl. How are you?
[patient]  I'm doing well. How are you?

[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Cheryl is a 34-year-old female with a past medical history significant for hypertension, who presents today with back pain. Cheryl, what happened to your back?
[patient]  So I've been walking a lot lately. I've been walking to 30 minutes to an hour or so a day. And all of a sudden, when I was walking my back just kind of seized up on me. And I don't really know what it was. Maybe I was going a little bit faster, but it just all kind of clenched.
[doctor]  Okay, so you felt like maybe like a spasm or something like that.
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  Okay. And how many days ago was that?
[patient]  That was about six days ago now.
[doctor]  Okay. And what have you taken for the pain?
[patient]  I've been taking ibuprofen, and then I've been putting some heat on it, but still pretty stiff.
[doctor]  Okay, alright. Um, and did you have any trauma before that happened? Were you doing anything strenuous like CrossFit or lifting boxes or anything like that before you went for for the walk?
[patient]  I've been lifting more probably around three times a week. So I don't know if it was because I was doing dead lifts that day and then walked.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  Maybe I was using my back more than my legs.
[doctor]  Okay, all right. And was it any particular area in your back? Was it the lower back?
[patient]  Yeah it was.
[doctor]  Okay. On one side versus the other.
[patient]  Um, kind of both equally.
[doctor]  Okay, alright. And any numbing or tingling in your legs or your feet.
[patient]  No, I haven't felt anything like that.
[doctor]  Okay. Any weakness in your lower extremities?
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Okay, alright. And then in terms of your blood pressure, how are you doing?
[patient]  So I got that cuff that you suggested that our, the last visit and I've been doing readings at home. And that's been looking great too. I've been watching my diet. Again, my boyfriend's been great in dieting with me. So I don't have to do it alone. And everything's been good.
[doctor]  Okay, excellent. And you're taking the lycein April?
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  Okay, wonderful. Okay. So I know you did a review of system sheet with the nurse and I know you endorse, you know, this back pain. Do you have any other symptoms? Fever, chills, congestion, cough, chest pain, shortness of breath?
[patient]  I have a little bit of nasal congestion, but that's just from my seasonal allergies.
[doctor]  Okay, alright, well let's go ahead. I want to do a quick physical exam on you.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Okay? Hey, dragon, show me the vital signs. So good, you know, here in the office, your vital signs look great. Your blood pressure is really well controlled, which is good. So that's a good job. So I'm going to take a listen to your heart and lungs. I'm going to examine your back and I'm going to let you know what I find. Okay?
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Okay, all right. So on physical examination, you know, everything looks good. You know, on your heart exam, I do hear that slight two out of six systolic ejection murmur, but you've had that before. That seems stable to me. On your back exam, you do have some pain to palpation on the right lateral aspect of your lumbar spine, and you do have pain with flexion and extension as well, and you have a negative straight leg raise. So what does that mean? So we're going to go over that. Okay? Let's, let me look at some of your results, though. First, okay?
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  We didn't x-ray before you saw me. So let's look at that. Hey, dragon, show me the back x-ray. So looking here at this x-ray of the lumbar spine, everything looks good. There's good bony alignment. There's no obvious fracture, you know, which is not surprising based on your history. Okay?
[patient]  And
[doctor]  Hey, dragon, show me the labs. And your labs that we did before you came in all look great. There's no elevated white blood cell count. There's no signs of infection. Again, those are all really good. Okay? So let me go over with you about my assessment and my plan for you. So for your first problem, this back pain, I think you have a lumbar strain and you know, that might have happened, you know, lifting something or exercising. And so what I want to do is prescribe meloxicam, 15 milligrams once a day. I want you, you can ice the area and you can also apply heat sometimes as well. You know, I'm going to refer you to physical therapy just to do some strengthening exercises of your back because I do want you to continue to be able to work out and exercise. Okay?
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  And for your last problem, your high blood pressure, again, everything looks great here. You know, I think you're doing a really good job with that as well. I want you to continue on the Lycinoprol 10 milligrams a day. And then let me know if you notice any increases in your blood pressure readings. Okay?
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Do you need a refill of the Lycein April?
[patient]  Yes, I do actually.
[doctor]  Okay. Hey, dragon, order license April 10 milligrams per daily. Okay. So the nurse will be in soon and she'll get you checked out. Okay.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Alright, hey, Dragon, finalize the note.","ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

Ms. Ramirez is a 34-year-old female with a past medical history significant for hypertension, who presents today with back pain.

Back pain.
• Medical Reasoning: She experienced a spasm-like pain in her back while walking approximately 6 days ago. She has also been lifting weights recently. Her lumbar spine x-ray was unremarkable and her recent labs were normal. I believe she has a lumbar strain.
• Medical Treatment: We will initiate meloxicam 15 mg once daily.
• Specialist Referrals: We will refer her to physical therapy to work on strengthening exercises.
• Patient Education and Counseling: She may apply ice and heat to the area.

Hypertension.
• Medical Reasoning: This is well controlled with lisinopril and dietary modifications based on home monitoring.
• Medical Treatment: She will continue lisinopril 10 mg daily. This was refilled today.
• Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged her to continue with home monitoring and report any elevated blood pressures to me.

[patient]  E ducto. I'm having this left shoulder pain lately and it's painting a lot.
[doctor]  Okay, all right. Hey dragon. I am seeing Mrs. Anderson a 44 years old female complaining to check the left shoulder pain. So how long has this lasted?
[patient]  It's been a weak doctor. Yeah.
[doctor]  A week.
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  Did you take any medication yourself?
[patient]  No, I did not take any pain medications. Actually, I did. I did take a Tylenol for two or three days, but then that didn't help at all. So, the reason why it started or when it started to happen is...
[doctor]  Yeah.
[patient]  I was actually in gymnastics class.
[doctor]  Yeah, okay.
[patient]  And I don't know. Maybe I must have toppled over into some weird position. So if it started to pain since then because of a certain move.
[doctor]  Okay. Uh...
[patient]  I went overboard, I think. Yeah.
[doctor]  All right, let me take a quick look. Can you move up a little bit? Yeah.
[patient]  Oh yeah, in fact that's hurts.
[doctor]  Does that does it hurt?
[patient]  Yeah, it does.
[doctor]  What if you moved back a little bit?
[patient]  that also hurts, Dr.
[doctor]  Yeah, okay.
[patient]  Any kind of movement on my left shoulder actually hurts.
[doctor]  Okay, alright. So let's, hey, Dragon, show me the last X-ray. Alright, from the X-ray, it doesn't look like there is any broken bone or fracture. My guess is you probably hurt your joint.
[patient]  Ah
[doctor]  A little bit.
[patient]  MM
[doctor]  So I would suggest you continue using the pain reliever, maybe just like 600 milligram of ibuprofen three times a day and use it for a week.
[patient]  And for how long? Yes.
[doctor]  for a week.
[patient]  A week, okay.
[doctor]  And then if it's still painful you can use ice or heat pad.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Because that might help relieve your pain.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Um
[patient]  But I wanted you to know that I did have past surgery on my left arm.
[doctor]  Thank you.
[patient]  So I hope it shouldn't matter, right?
[doctor]  That doesn't seem related to your pain.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  So, but I would try to rest my left arm.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  while it's healing.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  So um
[patient]  Can I carry any heavy weights or...
[doctor]  No, no. Definitely not.
[patient]  Anything like that?
[doctor]  Definitely not.
[patient]  Okay. Okay.
[doctor]  Yeah, use, um, right hand.
[patient]  Okay.

[patient]  Okay, sure.
[doctor]  But you should be fine.
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  after just resting and regular pain reliever.
[patient]  Okay. Alright.
[doctor]  Um
[patient]  Should we take another X-ray when I come back? If the pain doesn't improve?
[doctor]  Maybe. Let's see how you're doing in the next three weeks.
[patient]  Ah
[doctor]  Hey, dragon. Order medications and procedures as discussed. All right.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Um, I think that's good for today. Hope you feel better soon.
[patient]  Okay, thank you, doctor.
[doctor]  Yeah.
[patient]  Hopefully the pain reliever, uh, ibuprofen actually helps.
[doctor]  Yeah.
[patient]  Yeah, and if I have more pain, can I call you? Can I fix up another appointment earlier than three weeks?
[doctor]  You can also try AdVol.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Jeoooo!

At this point, I discussed the diagnosis and treatment options with the patient. I have recommended taking ibuprofen 600 mg three times per day for one week. If the patient does not have relief from the ibuprofen she will take Aleve. The patient may also utilize ice or heat packs. She should rest her left arm and may not lift or carry heavy objects with her left arm. The patient should follow up in three to four weeks if the pain persists. We may repeat the left shoulder x-ray at that time.

[patient]  I'm doing well. There's been so many events now that we've been able to get vaccinated. I've been able to see my grandkids again. Go to more birthday parties. It's been fantastic.
[doctor]  Yeah, I know. I mean, we've had some communication over telehealth and that type of thing, but it's not the same as being in person, so I'm happy to see you today. Now, tell me a little bit about, you know, we haven't really got a chance to talk about your depression. How are you? How are you doing with that? I know we haven't had you on medication in the past, because you're on medication for other things. What are your strategies with dealing with it?
[patient]  So I've been going to therapy once a week for the past year. Mostly virtually, but starting to get in-person. Virtual was a bit of struggle, but I feel like being in-person with someone really helps me.
[doctor]  Okay, and do you have a good support system at home?
[patient]  Yes, I do. I have my husband and my kids are right down the street from me, so I'm very lucky.

[doctor]  Okay, and are you taking the lycecinopiral that I prescribed?

Do you have any other symptoms, chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting, anything like that?
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  No? Okay. Alright. Well, I want to go ahead and do a quick physical exam, okay?
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Hey, dragon, show me the vital signs. So here in the office, you know, your blood pressure looks really good as does your heart rate. So you're doing a good job managing your blood pressure. So I'm going to take a listen to your heart and lungs, okay?
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Okay, so on physical examination, I don't appreciate any carotid roots in your neck. On your heart exam, I do notice a slight two-six systolic ejection murmur, which we've heard in the past, so I think that's stable. Your lungs in are nice and clear, and you have some trace lower extremity edema bilaterally. So all that means is, you know, I agree, you know, maybe we should watch your diet a little bit better, okay? But I want to take a look at some of your results, okay?
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  All right. Hey, Dragon, show me the EKG and the nurses did an EKG before you came in and that looks perfectly fine, okay? So I want to just go ahead and talk a little about your assessment and my plan for you. So for your first problem, your depression, I think you're doing a really good job with your strategies. I don't think it doesn't sound to me like I need to start you on any medication at this time unless you feel differently.
[patient]  No, I'm good in that department.
[doctor]  For your second problem, your high blood pressure, I agree. Everything looks fine here now. I want to just continue on the lycinopril, 20 milligrams a day. And I want you to continue to watch your blood pressures as well. And if they start rising, I want you to contact me, okay?
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  And for your third problem for an annual exam maintenance, you know, you do for a mammogram, so we'll go ahead and schedule that, okay?

[patient]  Can I take all my medicine at the same time? Does it matter?

"[doctor]  All right, today I am seeing Jose James. Uh, date of birth September 29th, 1957. Mr. James is a new patient who's having pain in his left shoulder and elbow. He fell five months ago going up a stairs and the pain has been present since.
[doctor]  Hi, Mr. James. I'm Dr. Isabella. How are you doing?
[patient]  I'm okay. Thank you.
[doctor]  That's good. That's good. Tell me what's brings you in today.
[patient]  Sure, so I've been having constant pain in my left shoulder and left elbow for a while about five months or so. It hurts all the time. Pretty bad at times.
[doctor]  Hmm, that does not sound like fun. It sounds like you injured it going up the stairs?
[patient]  Yes, that's correct. It was icy and I have to walk up a flight of stairs to my house. I stepped in my feet just one hour. Followed my left side, it seems like my shoulder and wrist took the brunt. It's been hurting since.
[doctor]  Yeah, that does seem like a likely cause of your symptoms. Anything seem to make the pain worse?
[patient]  Well, I've always hit the gym and lifted weights. I've been trying to keep with my routine of two days a week, but it's been hard. The pain is worse when I lift, and I haven't been able to lift more than 15 or 20 pounds, which is very frustrating.
[doctor]  Hmm, I can imagine it is when you're so accustomed to your routine.
[patient]  Exactly. I really enjoy my exercise, but over the past one to two weeks, I've stopped hitting the gym because the pain just wasn't worth it honestly. I do keep up with my walking though. My wife and I walk about 30 minutes almost every day. We have done this since I retired from my office job last year.
[doctor]  I do not blame you, mister. James, does anything seem to help the pain that you've tried?
[patient]  Not too much. I have iced a bit, but I have not taken anything for the pain. Stopping exercise and some ice has helped a bit, but it's still hurt enough for me to come to see you.
[doctor]  Yeah, okay. How about any numbness or tingling? Have you felt that at any point?
[patient]  No, Doc. Just pain. No tingling or numbness. Numbness, thankfully.
[doctor]  Understood. Understood. All right. Well, let's go ahead and take a look and see what's going on.
[patient]  Sound good. Thank you.
[doctor]  Okay, use my general physical exam template. Mr. James, I'm going to gently press around your shoulder and elbow here to see where your pain might be stemming from. Just let me know when it hurts.
[patient]  Okay, it hurts when you press there on my elbow and here on my shoulder.
[doctor]  Okay. Left shoulder and elbow. Tender essay space. No warmth. Airethema or deformity. Positive Hawkins Kennedy and Nears test. Normal proximal and distar. Distal upper extremity strength. Intact median radial ulnar sensation and abduction to 90 degrees. Normal empty tan can test. Okay, mister. James, W. what I think you're dealing with is impingement syndrome of your left shoulder. I don't think there's an additional injury or issue with your wrist, but because everything is connected, you're experiencing pain in your wrist because of your shoulder. We do see this type of issue when someone has a fall, so it's good you came to see us. You came into see us so we could help.
[patient]  So what are possible treatments?
[doctor]  Well, we have a few options you can try. First option would be to start with physical therapy. I would recommend two sessions per week, as well as any other exercises they give you to do at home. We can start there, and if that doesn't improve your pain, then we could try a cordicone injection.
[patient]  I like the idea of starting with the physical therapy and having next step if it doesn't help. I'm not opposed to a shot, but would like to try the therapy first.
[doctor]  All right, great. I'll get a referral order and they will call you within the next day or two to get you scheduled.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Also, please continue to ice, especially your shoulder and rest as much as you can.
[patient]  Okay, I will.
[doctor]  Give us a call or email us if you have symptoms worsened, if your symptoms worsened or do not improve with the therapy.
[patient]  We'll do. Thank you. I appreciate your help.
[doctor]  You're welcome. Have a great day.
[patient]  You too.
[doctor]  All right, assessment is impingement syndrome of left shoulder. Plan discussed with patient. Referral is requested for Dr. Martha Rivera to be in physical therapy two days per week.","ASSESSMENT

"[doctor]  Next patient is Randy Gutierrez. Data of birth August 10th, 2020. Please use review of symptoms. All texts to write. Physical exam. Auto text jury.
[doctor]  Hello, how are you doing today?
[patient]  We're okay, thank you.
[doctor]  That's good to hear. So how many days has Randy been feeling sick?
[patient]  Well, I would say it started around separate time last night.
[doctor]  Last night, okay, and what's been going on?
[patient]  Well, he started to get a runny nose.
[doctor]  Okay, and is he stuffy too?
[patient]  Yeah. Yeah.
[doctor]  Okay, and have you noticed is his mucus clear right now?
[patient]  It is, it is right now, yes.
[doctor]  Okay. And does he also have a cough?
[patient]  Yes, but it's not barkey.
[doctor]  And does he act like he has a sore throat or is he pulling on his ears?
[patient]  Well, I know he's been pulling on his ears, yeah.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  You know, he also, he's also been going crazy rubbing at his nose too.
[doctor]  Okay. And any fever you've noticed?
[patient]  I checked his rectal temperature and it was 100.3.
[doctor]  Okay, so a little bit of a low grade fever there, definitely. And how was his appetite? Did he eat last night?
[patient]  Yes, he did. Yeah.
[doctor]  And how about this morning? Did he eat his breakfast?
[patient]  Uh, this morning he ate about seven ounces from the bottle.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  And then he got another bottle, and he barely ate that. Um, I offered him cereal and he wouldn't eat that either.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  So, he varies, I guess.
[doctor]  How is his energy? Does he seem like he wants to take more naps? Or does he have pretty good energy?
[patient]  MMM, it seems like he's irritable.
[doctor]  irritable because he isn't feeling good.
[patient]  Yeah. He's energetic, but it seems like he can't go to sleep, like, he's fighting it really hard.
[doctor]  Okay, and just for the chart, is there anyone, anybody else exposed to him who has been sick?
[patient]  Yes, his older sister's been sick.
[doctor]  Thank you.
[patient]  We also had a play date with my nephew, who I learned later had a sinus infection.
[doctor]  And what medication have you tried for him? Anything at all?
[patient]  I've been doing the saline mist in his nose.
[doctor]  Good good. That's a good choice.
[patient]  I did give him Tylenol really early this morning because he was warm when I took the sleeper off of him, and we had the AC on in the house, but his whole body was sweating.
[doctor]  I see. And any other medications?
[patient]  We did put some baby vicks on his feet last night to try and help him breathe. And, I also used the humidifier.
[doctor]  Okay, that's good.
[patient]  Okay. Okay.
[doctor]  So, there was another thing I wanted to bring up since we're here. It appears that his cradle cap has gotten a little worse. What are you using on it?
[patient]  I've been using the Cradle Cap brush, and then I use regular Aveno shampoo.
[doctor]  Is it a dandruff shampoo?
[patient]  No, I don't think so.
[doctor]  Okay, thank you. Well, let's complete his exam and then we'll talk about the next steps.
[patient]  Okay, sounds good.
[doctor]  Can you take a big breath, Randy?
[patient]  Where's Mama?
[doctor]  Don't forget to breathe little one. Okay, let's try the front two.
[patient]  Yeah, it's okay buddy.
[doctor]  Excellent. He's doing excellent. Next, let's check out those ears.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Let's try to make sure you don't tip all the way over.
[patient]  Dino, you're doing so good.
[doctor]  Alright, ears look okay. We're going to slide you forward so you don't bump your head when I lay you down.
[patient]  Hey, you're hey you're okay. You're okay.
[doctor]  Okay, you can go ahead and sit and back up if you like.
[patient]  Alright. Thank you.
[doctor]  All right, so he's just kind of getting started with this and I think we're seeing something viral right now. Often sinus infections will start out as a virus and then will become bacterial infections if left alone and doesn't go away. But I don't think he needs any antibiotics, at least not at this point in time. Um, keep up with the fluids, rest, and I would watch him very carefully for a barking cough. If he does get a barking cough, then that tends to be a little bit more significant and a little more severe. So if he develops a barking cough, I want you to give him a half a teaspoon of his sister's medicine.
[doctor]  You know, I'm almost tempted to give you some of the medicine because they're probably sharing the same virus.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Actually, I will. I'll go ahead and just give you some as well.
[patient]  Okay. Okay.
[doctor]  But if he doesn't become barky, you don't have to use it. It only works for the barky cough.
[patient]  and then got it.
[doctor]  Okay, we'll do the same thing with him as long as nothing gets worse and we'll see him back in one week. So, it won't get rid of a regular cough. He can use sarbys, but use the dose for kids under a year of age. So, if you want to get some of that, you can definitely try that for him. It can help out a little bit with the regular cough.
[patient]  I do have a question. Do you or do you not give honey to babies?
[doctor]  Yes, that's a great question. You don't give honey to kids under a year. Instead, you can give them a govy, which is a different type of nectar. Now you can give honey to his older sister. That is okay, but for him, it would not be very good because his stomach acids not good enough to break down the botulism's force. So it'd cause him harm. You should look at the package of, say, honey nut Cheerios. It says, right on there, to not give it to a baby.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Now, whether that would really hurt a baby, I am unsure, but it has real honey in it. So, no honey for him, but a gauvey is definitely fine.
[patient]  Okay. So, Zarbees for the stuffy nose.
[doctor]  Yes, Sarbys.
[patient]  And then you said, uh, which medicine to give him just in case?
[doctor]  I'm going to give him the same medicine as a sister and just hang on to it just to watch and see. If this was a Monday and we had a whole week to watch, I would say to just call us if things got worse. But since if it's going to be the weekend and things might worsen tonight or tomorrow night, I'd rather you have just what you need on hand.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Right. Does that make sense?
[patient]  Yeah, yeah. That makes sense.
[doctor]  Okay, great. And that way you don't have to share with a sister.
[patient]  Right, OK.
[doctor]  And since he's about half her size, we'll do half the dose, which is a half a teaspoon.
[patient]  Okay. Will this information all be in the papers?
[doctor]  Yes. And so, if he ends up starting the medicine, just give him a half a teaspoon for five days.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Yeah, that's the only thing it won't say is, as needed, or anything like that.
[patient]  Mimim understood. Thank you.
[doctor]  You're welcome.
[patient]  and a cradle cap.
[doctor]  What I would do is use something like either head and shoulders or selce and blue or a niser all add. Now don't get the extra strength stuff. Just use the regular strength. Cradle cap, it's just basically a fancy way of saying dandruff. So those shampoos will help get rid of it. It's not an immediate thing because they are all dead scales and you still have to brush them off. So continue to use the soft brush and some baby oil or something that will help get the scales out. And those shampoos will actually help to prevent it as well. Use it two times per week, not every day, but maybe twice a week.
[doctor]  So, two days between shampooing, use what you normally use any other time. And then, often within six weeks or so, you'll notice that the cradle cap is just not coming back anymore. But he has to be careful because it's not pH balanced for eyes. So, just make sure when you're rinsing his hair, you avoid his eyes.
[patient]  Okay. Okay.
[doctor]  All right, and if it keeps getting worse, definitely let us know.
[patient]  Okay. Sounds good.
[doctor]  Good. And since they don't have COVID-19, you can go right ahead and check out.
[patient]  Okay. And both appointments in the week.
[doctor]  Correct. We'll see you all then. By Randy, feel better.
[patient]  Alright, great. Thank you so much.
[doctor]  You are welcome and have a good rest of your day.","ASSESSMENT

• Viral infection
• Dandruff

PLAN

Viral infection
The patient presents with a viral infection and does not need antibiotics currently. I advised continuation of fluids, rest. Additionally, I suggested trying Zarbee’s for children under 1 years old. If a croup cough develops, the patient will receive a 0.5 teaspoon.

I also provided counseling to the mother to avoid giving honey to the patient for his first year of life due to botulism spores.

Dandruff
The patient is experiencing worsening symptoms of dandruff. I recommended Head and Shoulders shampoo, Selsun Blue, or Nizoral A-D 2 times per week, combined with his usual shampoo. I counseled the mother that she should be careful not to get the shampoo in the patient eyes and to not use the extra strength shampoos. Additionally, he may also use baby oil and a soft brush on the area.

"[doctor]  Kaila Ward, date of birth, April 28, 07. MRN3-8-4-9-2-0. She's here for a new visit with her mother for acne located on the face, which started about two years ago and is present most every day. She has been using PursuGel and Washing regularly, which is somewhat helpful. There are no associated symptoms, including itching, bleeding, or pain. No additional past medical history. She lives with her parents and sister. They have a dog, bird, and bunnies. She is in seventh grade. She plays basketball and volleyball and tap. She wears sunscreen in the summer, SPF 30. No additional family history. Hi, Kaila. I'm Dr. One Price. I hear you are starting to get some acne on the face. How about the chest and back?
[patient]  It's not too bad.
[doctor]  So, it's not bad on the chest or back. You've used some over-the-counter items like washes and persagell?
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  Do those seem to be helping?
[patient]  Yes, I think so a little bit.
[doctor]  Good. What's your skincare routine like now?
[patient]  Do you want to know the things I currently use?
[doctor]  Yes. What do you do for your acne in the morning? And then what do you do at night time?
[patient]  I wash my face more like I wipe it down in the morning. Then at night, I use an L facial cleanser called the Super Clarity Cleanser. I finish with a toner and then the Purse Agile.
[doctor]  When you say, wipe your face in the morning. Do you use a product or just water?
[patient]  Um, just water and a washcloth really. If I feel really greasy, sometimes I'll use the elf cleanser in the morning too.
[doctor]  Okay, and is today a good day, bad day, or an average day for you?
[patient]  I would say it's probably a good day for me, of course, since I'm here, right?
[doctor]  Acne is always good when you come to see the doctor. Do you find that your acne flares with your periods?
[patient]  No, not really.
[doctor]  And, do you get a regular period?
[patient]  Yep.
[doctor]  How long have you been getting a regular period?
[patient]  I'm on my thing about two years.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  The biggest flare, probably, was when she started school sports in the fall, just with all the sweating.
[doctor]  Yup, that will do it. Is there anything else that you've noticed Mrs Ward?
[patient]  No. Kayla really has been doing a good job with the facial care regimen. It just doesn't seem to help as much as we wanted.
[doctor]  Got it. Okay. Well, let's take a look then. Full exam is performed today, except for under the underwear and under the bra, multiple benign knee-vi on the trunk and extremities, scattered skin-colored papules, open and closed comodones, and arithmatious papules on the face, primarily on the forehead, and with also some on the central cheeks and chin. The chest and back are relatively spared, and the remainder of the examination is normal. So, what I'm seeing from your exam today is mild to moderate acne, mostly comodonal with small inflammatory component.
[patient]  Okay, so is there anything we can do to help it?
[doctor]  Yes. I would like to start with a topical therapy first. Every morning, you will wash your face with a mild cleanser than use a moisturizer labeled non-commetogenic with sunscreen SPF30 or higher. This means it won't clog your pores. Now in the evening, wash your face with the same cleanser and allow it to dry. Apply a Dappeline 0.1% cream in a thin layer to the areas you generally get acne. I want you to start off using this a few nights a week and slowly work up to using it every night. If it is, excuse me, if it is very expensive or not covered by insurance, you can try different gel over the counter. You can follow that with clean and clear per se gel in a thin layer or where you generally get acne. And then a non-commetogenic moisturizer. Your atopic retinoid will cause some sensitivity, so you will need to wear sunscreen when you are outside. It may also cause some dryness or irritation.
[patient]  Okay, I can do that.
[doctor]  You also have multiple benign moles on your arms, legs, back, and abdomen. This means they all look normal with no worrisome features. We will see if you have any progress over the next six months and follow up at that time.
[patient]  Okay, that sounds good. Thank you.
[doctor]  Do you have any questions for me?
[patient]  no i don't think so
[doctor]  Okay, if you have questions or concerns before your next visit, please call the office.
[patient]  Thank you, Dr. Wewill.","ASSESSMENT

"[doctor]  Patient is Julia Jones, date of birth May 16, 1996. She is a new breast reduction consult. Hello, how are you doing today? I'm Dr. Gonzalez. It's nice to meet you.
[patient]  Nice to meet you, ma'am. How are you?
[doctor]  I'm doing good. Thank you. So you're here to discuss a breast reduction, correct?
[patient]  Yes, that's right.
[doctor]  Okay, perfect. Let me just get logged in here. Have you met with anyone before about a breast reduction?
[patient]  No, I haven't.
[doctor]  Okay. And how long have you been considering this?
[patient]  It's probably been about 6 or 7 years, but I mean it's always been in the back of my mind.
[doctor]  Well, I perform a lot of breast reduction surgeries pretty much every week, so it is a very common procedure.
[patient]  Okay, that's reassuring.
[doctor]  Yeah. So what I want to do first is just get a little bit of history about the sort of symptoms that you're having. And then I'll do a quick exam.
[patient]  Okay, that sounds good.
[doctor]  And then we'll talk more about the surgery and what entails. And at this point, who is your insurance provider?
[patient]  I have blue cross blue shield. Well, actually my husband just accepted a new job and I will be on his plan, which I believe is not gonna be blue cross, but it may be changing.
[doctor]  Okay, what we typically do when we do a breast reduction consult, I'll document your symptoms, symptoms, we'll take some pictures then, they get sent to the insurance company. And what they'll do is decide whether it's approved or medically necessary or not. But we want to make sure we send it to the right insurance. Do you know when you'll be on the new plan?
[patient]  Most likely July.
[doctor]  Okay, so we may just wait until July to submit for approval at that time.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  So regarding your symptoms, do you experience back pain?
[patient]  Well, I'll be going to the chiropractor for a few years. I do have a lot of pain here and here, but I don't know if it's all for my breasts or not. It gets painful and builds up, so I think I could attribute it to my breasts when I'm working in my desk all day.
[doctor]  Okay, and in your neck and your upper back. And how long has this been going on? Would you say five years, ten years, or even since puberty?
[patient]  I would say since I was in high school.
[doctor]  Okay, and do you have the bra strap indentations in your shoulders? Um, I saw that you're wearing about a g cup.
[patient]  Yes, I do get indentations, but I don't really wear a regular bra that often. I mostly wear a 34-E sports bra because it's more comfortable, and the others are expensive in my size.
[doctor]  Yeah, I have heard that as well. And have you had any children? Or are you planning to have any children in the future?
[patient]  No, I do not have any kids now. But we might plan to in the future.
[doctor]  Okay, and at this time, are you experiencing any numbness or tingling in the S in the hands or any nipple pain?
[patient]  Sometimes yes.
[doctor]  Okay, and rashes. Do you get any rashes underneath your breasts? And it could be from sweating.
[patient]  No, but they're always sweaty.
[doctor]  Okay, and then do you feel like your activities are limited because of the size?
[patient]  There's certain things I do when I have to hold them, like working out in any jumping or running. And it hurts.
[doctor]  And it hurts, okay. And you saw a chiropractor. But what about physical therapy for your back pain? Or do you take any pain medicine for it?
[patient]  Why no, but I do take a migraine medication per pranolol.
[doctor]  That's okay. So let's see. I know that you have a history of breast cancer in your family. Have you had any mammograms? And how old was your mother when she had it?
[patient]  Mom was 40 and they recommended me starting at age 30 for mammogram. I'm still, I mean I'm 25, so I'm still a little bit young.
[doctor]  Okay. And otherwise it seems like you're really healthy.
[patient]  Yes, for the most part, I lost about 10 pounds over the past few months, and I still would like to lose about 20 more pounds.
[doctor]  Congratulations. That's great. And then um
[patient]  Thank you.
[doctor]  So then you're welcome and so do you use any tobacco drugs or alcohol and then You said that you were going to school. What are you going to school for?
[patient]  I drew a little wine on occasion and for school, I'm currently studying psychology.
[doctor]  Okay, that's great. Alright, so what we'll do is we'll go ahead and take a look. I'm going to take a couple of measurements, and we'll kind of talk about the surgery afterwards. So go ahead and stand up for me, Julia. Okay, so looking at the measurements, it looks like one breast is a little lower than the other.
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  Okay, well, thank you so much. It looks like I have all the measurements that we need. You can go ahead and cover up now.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  So, I think you're a great candidate for a breast reduction. When we talk about a breast reduction, what happens is that we remove the tissue out of the breast.
[patient]  Okay, that's fine.
[doctor]  And we would then lift them and elevate the nipple position in order to help with your back pain, neck pain, and because I'm a plastic surgeon. Of course, I want them to look nice as well.
[patient]  Right?
[doctor]  So typically when you do the breast reduction, we make an incision around the nipple straight down and then underneath. And it kind of looks like an anchor below, then straight down and underneath, and through that incision we're able to F to lift the breast. And we'll take off any extra fat and brush breast tissue. So that way it becomes smaller in size. And I notice that you would like to be AB cup. So I do tell every patient we can make you as small as your blood supply allows. And what that means is we must move the nipple without cutting off any of its blood supply during the surgery.
[patient]  Okay, well, thank you for explaining that.
[doctor]  You're welcome. And in your case, you'll probably be a small C. A B cup might be a little bit small, but we'll see once I'm doing the procedure for you.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  And typically the surgery takes about three hours. You will have drains, one in each side, and that helps prevent fluid from building up in the breast. And that stays in for about a week. And then we'll remove them in the clinic. And you'll have a clear plastic tape over your incision that should help with the scars. And we've seen that patients who have lighter skin, the scars will tend to be red at first. And then it takes about a year for a scar to mature in line.
[patient]  Okay, well, I'm not too worried about the scores.
[doctor]  Okay, and I do like to keep patients overnight. It's just going to be for one night in the hospital. And we just want to make sure your pain is controlled, make sure you're not nauseated, all of that stuff. Some patients want to go home that same day. But you know that some people get nauseated. And the last thing that I want is for you to be vomiting at home alone without the support here at the facility.
[patient]  Okay, yeah, that sounds good.
[doctor]  Okay, and then about 30% of patients say that they cannot breastfeed after a breast reduction, and the reason is the breast is made up of fat. And it's also made up of a gland. And the gland is what produces the milk.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  And so in order to reduce the size of the breast, we have to take out both the fat and the glands. So it just depends on how much is left, whether you can breastfeed in the future. And then also, the breast will change over time. If you gain weight, they will get larger, things like that.
[patient]  Yeah, okay.
[doctor]  And if you have children, they will change as well. They will enlarge, especially if you can breastfeed. But they'll go back down and will appear a little bit deflated.
[patient]  Yeah, I don't know if I'm interested in breastfeeding.
[doctor]  Okay, the hormones of pregnancy, though, will change the breasts, so that's just something to be aware of, and I tell all younger patients that.
[patient]  Okay, yeah. Absolutely.
[doctor]  And then typically nipple sensation is fine after breast reduction, but there is a slight chance that you'll have an alteration in the nipple sensation or not have any sensation in the nipple. Generally the nipple is just fine unless it is a massive reduction. And it's quite normal after surgery to be a little bit bruised, and then it just takes some time for that to go away.
[patient]  Yeah, okay.
[doctor]  But other than that, most patients are very happy after the breast reduction because the symptoms of the back pain, the neck pain, you can feel relief almost immediately. So do you have any questions, Julia, about the process or anything like that?
[patient]  No, not really.
[doctor]  Okay, and I do think you're a good candidate for it. And I think you'll benefit from it as well.
[patient]  Good, I look forward to a relief.
[doctor]  I think you just have to do it when you are ready. When you know that you feel like it's a good time because it is a commitment and you will have some activity restrictions for about six weeks after surgery, no heavy lifting. And I do say no driving for two to three weeks. And the drains stay in like I said for about a week.
[patient]  Okay, well, I am ready as soon as my insurance is switched over.
[doctor]  Okay, well I think from this point if you want to we can take photos today while you're here. I have all the documentation now in the note about your symptoms and that's what the insurance company is going to look for. So thank you for answering those questions. So once we have a new provider we'll go ahead and get that submitted. And then when they approve it what the office will do is they'll work with you on a surgery date and then we'll meet again right before the surgery to answer any last minute questions and go over the instructions in more detail. Things like that.
[patient]  Okay, well, I will notify the office as soon as I have the insurance information.
[doctor]  That sounds great. And then we can get it all in process. And it was so nice to meet you. And Katherine will be right in to get your photos.

• Macromastia.

Julia Jones is a 25-year-old female with symptomatic macromastia presenting for evaluation of breast reduction. The patient has attempted non-surgical treatments with minimal relief and is an ideal candidate for bilateral reduction mammoplasty. Her minimum required resection based on a BSA of 2.65 with the Schnur scale is 1792 g, which should be attainable. Given her extremely large breasts and the measurements above, there is potential for using a free nipple graft.

PLAN

An extensive discussion of breast reduction surgery was performed with the patient with consideration of the patient's age, co-morbidities, previous surgical history, body habitus, BMI, and smoking history. Surgical time, immediate recovery course, and longer term recovery course were discussed. Relief of the patient's current symptoms related to macromastia was not guaranteed though is expected to improve. Specific breast size was discussed, also not guaranteed. I explained the expected outcomes of using a free nipple graft such as an insensate nipple and an inability to breast feed. The patient understands that the decision for a free nipple graft will be made intraoperatively based on assessment of nipple perfusion.

Risks and benefits of were discussed with the patient The patient understands the above risks, benefits and alternatives to surgery and wishes to proceed with bilateral reduction mammaplasty.

The patient will be switching to a different insurance policy in 07/2021. Once we get the new insurance information from the patient, we will submit it to her insurance company. If approved, she will return for preoperative counseling and consent.

"[doctor]  Kellywood, date of birth, February 15, 1979. Established patient here for renal ultrasound because of hematuria. urine dipstick today. Negative for leukocytes, nitrates, protein, ketone, bilirubin, and glucose. Color yellow and clear. Eurobillenogen 0.2. pH 5.5 and specific gravity 1.020. There is a trace amount of blood in the urine and intact. Renal ultrasound impression. Right kidney is 10 centimeters in length by 5 centimeter wide. There are no stones, masses, or hydronophrosis. The left kidney is 10.8 centimeters in length and 5 centimeters wide. There is a 6 millimeter left renal stone non-obstructing. 533 milliliters prevoid and 0 milliliters post void. Hi Mrs. Wood. I see you just finished your ultrasound.
[patient]  Yes ma'am.
[doctor]  Well, it looks like you have one stone in the left kidney, but it's not obstructing anything.
[patient]  I knew it had to be a kidney stone. I passed what looked like two small stones last week after I scheduled this appointment. And then for the past six weeks, I've had a few episodes of bright red urine the color of like cherry coolade. And last week, I was constantly having to pee and it hurt something terrible.
[doctor]  How bad was your pain on a scale of 0 to 10? Zero being no pain and 10 being worse, as you can imagine.
[patient]  Um, at the time, I'd say an eight.
[doctor]  Are you having any flank pain now or tenderness in your lower back?
[patient]  No, after passing those stones, things have felt a lot better.
[doctor]  That's good to hear. Now, it looks like you're only taking Oliver 10 milligrams a day and have no drug allergies. Is that correct?
[patient]  That's right.
[doctor]  Alright, let's take a look at you today. Let's use my default P. Well, Mrs. Wood, we know that the blood in your urine was due to the kidney stones. Fortunately, you passed two last week and the blood has nearly subsided. You do still have one stone in the left kidney. Since it's not obstructing or causing pain, I don't recommend any surgical intervention at this time.
[patient]  I like to know what I can do to stop getting these stones.
[doctor]  As we discussed last time, the formation of kidney stones cannot be attributed to a particular cause. But several factors increase the risk, such as dehydration, family history, certain foods, digestive tract disease, and certain medical conditions.
[patient]  Yeah, I know I don't drink near the amount of water that I should. I drink more mountain dew than anything.
[doctor]  You should drink about half of your body weight in ounces of water a day.
[patient]  So if I wait 250 pounds, I should drink.
[doctor]  That would be 125 ounces of water a day, and you should avoid drinking sugary drinks like Mountain Dew.
[patient]  Okay, is there any food I should need?
[doctor]  Great question. You should avoid food rich in sodium oxalate and animal protein. So that would be salty, processed food because they're high in sodium. Ideally, you should consume less than 1,000 milligrams of sodium a day and reduce the amount of beef, poultry, fish, and pork.
[patient]  What's Oxalate?
[doctor]  It's an organic acid found in plants that when digested, it binds to minerals that stones are formed from. Foods like spinach, chocolate, beets, rhubarb, and soy products.
[patient]  Well, I'll do whatever it takes to try to avoid getting these stones again.
[doctor]  Great. And here's a handout that you can look over. It goes over the dietary recommendations and what to avoid.
[patient]  Okay good. I like to have things in writing to help me remember.
[doctor]  Perfect. Well, if you have any more questions, if you don't have any more questions, you're all set. I won't need to see you back until next year, as long as you don't have any more issues like bleeding or pain. If you do have any issues, you can always call the office sooner. And if you experience any severe pain or bright red blood in your urine, you should go to the emergency room.
[patient]  Alright, well, let's hope we don't have to do either of those and I see you next year.
[doctor]  Yes, let's hope. Come right this way and I'll walk you to check out. Abde de peab domín. No flink pain. Antigue. Normal vaginal exam. Primary diagnosis is hemateria. Secondary diagnosis is chronic ural urelathiasis. Thank you. This completes Mrs. Woodencounter.","ASSESSMENT

• Hematuria.
• Chronic urolithiasis.

Mrs. Wood presents today for renal ultrasound. The patient has had recurrent episodes of hematuria over the past few months secondary to chronic urolithiasis. Mrs. Wood reports passing two small stone like structures last week. Urinalysis today was notable for only a trace amount of blood and the renal ultrasound revealed a 6 mm non-obstructing renal stone in the left kidney.

PLAN

No surgical intervention is recommended, and the patient would like to discuss urolithiasis prevention. We had a very lengthy discussion with regards to urolithiasis formation and treating the underlying cause to prevent reoccurrence and associated potential dietary factors that could be involved with urolithiasis formation.

It is recommended that the patient maintain a healthy diet; limit salt, and animal protein. she should increase fluid consumption; adequate intake is half of her body weight in ounces of water daily and avoid sugary drinks. A copy of the dietary recommendations and avoidances was provided to the patient for reference. We will continue to monitor annually with renal ultrasound unless new symptoms develop. The patient voiced understanding and agreed with the recommended medical treatment plan.

INSTRUCTIONS

Follow up in 1 year with renal ultrasound, sooner should symptoms arise. Should you develop sudden onset of severe pain or gross hematuria go to the emergency room.

"[doctor]  Next patient is Melissa Sanchez, date of birth September 23rd 1962, MRN 548 for 367. She's being seen in office today for status post-Mitral Valve repair done on August 3rd, 2020. At her previous follow-up on September 17th, we felt that she was doing quite well from a cardiac standpoint and so we recommended she continue with the same medication. ECG taken on December 26th, 2020 reveals atrial fibrillation with a controlled ventricular response. T-wave inversion anteriorly. Compared to the previous study, there are no significant changes and please add in the history, patient has a history of mitral regurgitation and atrial fibrillation, history of diabetes, asthma and recurrent chest discomfort with negative cardiac workup for coronary artery disease.
[doctor]  Yes, Sanchez, it's good to see you again.
[patient]  Yeah, it's good seeing you two doctor hues. You look like you're doing well.
[doctor]  I am... thank you. You too. You're looking great. How have you been feeling?
[patient]  Pretty good. I'm definitely feeling better. Thank goodness. I was having a rough time before surgery. But I think I'm overall pretty good now though.
[doctor]  Okay, well, that's really good to hear. I'm glad. Are you having any news symptoms right now?
[patient]  No, not really. But, you know, I'm still getting some chest pain sometimes, and my breathing gets shallow. But I guess I'm learning what I can and can't do. So if I feel like that, if I'm like exerting myself, I slow down a bit which helps, and then when I go back to it later, I can usually finish whatever I was doing.
[doctor]  Okay, so it does go away though. How long does an episode seem to last?
[patient]  Uh, only a few minutes, I guess. Then it disappears for a while. It's weird.
[doctor]  What is a while?
[patient]  It goes away for a couple of weeks. So when it happens, I just take the day nice and slow. I don't push myself.
[doctor]  Okay, so maybe it's a couple times a month you feel this way?
[patient]  Yeah, just often enough for me to notice.
[doctor]  Understood. Okay. Are you taking your medications regularly?
[patient]  Ah, I've been trying to keep up with that. There are a lot of extra pills now, but I have a reminder app, so I do pretty well.
[doctor]  Okay, that's great. And so you're taking Cumidon, right?
[patient]  Yeah, also Lasix and the Atennial All.
[doctor]  Are you having any side effects from the medications at all?
[patient]  Not really. Uh, I noticed that the attendle all is making me irritable in the beginning, but I guess I've gotten used to it. Doesn't seem to bother me as much now.
[doctor]  Okay, well, that sounds good. Sounds like you're well on the mend. So why don't I start out with the physical exam and just check you out.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  You're going to hear me describe things in detail or repeat things as I go to reference later for my notes.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Okay then, I'm going to be using my status post template, MS, Sanchez. Please lie down on the table here and we'll get started. All right, can you turn your head to the left? Head and neck no JVD detected. You can turn back now and just take a couple of deep breaths for me please. Okay, that's good. And lungs have reduced breath, but osculation and percussion are clear. Okay, breath normally. I'm just going to listen to your heart. Rhythm is irregularly irregular.
[patient]  That's a funny statement. What does that mean?
[doctor]  Yeah, it just sounds kind of weird, right? It's when your heart doesn't beat with the correct rhythm, and whatever rhythm it doesn't have a pattern to it. So, it's part of the atrial fibrillation.
[patient]  Wow, that sounded like a mess.
[doctor]  Yeah, it's not ideal. But many people have AFib are able to keep it under control with medicine and lifestyle changes.
[patient]  Act I see. That's good to know.
[doctor]  Okay, so S1 slightly accentuated. No S3. I'm going to touch your belly and does any of that hurt?
[patient]  Nope.
[doctor]  How about there? And your feet?
[patient]  No, not really.
[doctor]  Okay, great. And trace peripheral edema on extremities. All right, MS. Sanchez, you can sit up now. So, it looks like your heart valves are working well and you are recovering from the surgery nicely.
[patient]  Good.
[doctor]  Yes. We are. We looked at your ECG taken earlier today and we are seeing the AFib but it's being well controlled with the medicine and you're taking Cuminin for milligrams, LASIX at 4 milligrams a day, and the TENALALL you're taking that every day as well, right?
[patient]  Yes, the 50 milligrams every day.
[doctor]  Great! It sounds like you're well on your way to recovery.
[patient]  Great.
[doctor]  So, let's continue on your current meds. I'm glad that you're figuring out what your body can handle. Definitely try to keep active as that will certainly help.
[patient]  I'll do my best.
[doctor]  And that's about it. Do you have any questions for me?
[patient]  I do. When I need to come back and get checked out.
[doctor]  Well, I don't think you need to come back soon. Everything from a cardio perspective is fine. So, I think let's do a follow-up in about 6 to 9 months.
[patient]  Alright, thank you. It was good to see you again, Dr. Hughes.
[doctor]  You as well MS, Sanchez do take care.

[patient]  I'm doing good. Thank you. How are you?
[doctor]  I'm great, thanks. So how have you been since the last time? I know the last time we were talking about decreasing your prednisondos, correct?
[patient]  Yes, I'm just on one now and that seems to be enough.
[doctor]  Ah, that's great to hear.
[patient]  Yeah, there were a couple days there I took an extra one just because there was a little extra pain in my feet. And I do have a desk job, so when I have a day off where I'm moving around a lot they do tend to hurt a bit more.
[doctor]  Okay. How many times did you do that?
[patient]  It wasn't often maybe once a week.
[doctor]  Okay, so it sounds like we're still on track for discontinuing the prednisone. We'll do that today and you can let me know how it goes on your next visit. And how about the Method Trek S8? Do you think that helped with your joint pain?
[patient]  Yeah, definitely. Because I want to get my COVID shots. But from the letter I got about it, it said that it could interfere with the vaccine, you know, reduce the efficacy. So I didn't take it on the week that I got the first shot.
[doctor]  Okay. And what happened?
[patient]  I felt absolutely horrible until I took it again a week later.
[doctor]  I'm sorry to hear that. And what did you do about the second dose?
[patient]  Well, I called into the hotline because I was in so much pain with the first one. And they said, no, just go ahead and take it, so I did.
[doctor]  Okay, that's good then. We do have to keep an eye out on it since it's a high-risk medication. Do you have an appointment to get your blood drawn for the next time?
[patient]  No, I didn't give me one.
[doctor]  Okay, so we can do that for you too. Um, so what questions do you have for me, Judy?
[patient]  Well, I just wanted to know why I was getting all these bruises here, so like when I bum myself. I don't know where they're coming from.
[doctor]  Okay, that's probably from the prednisone. It can increase bruising.
[patient]  Okay, I didn't know that. Um, I don't even feel it when it happens. They just show up.
[doctor]  Yeah. Unfortunately, that can happen, but we're working on discontinuing that, so let's see if the bruises do go away.
[patient]  Okay, that sounds good thanks.
[doctor]  Okay, Judy, please sit up here and I'll take a look, shoes, and socks off, please.
[patient]  Alright.
[doctor]  All right, let me see here. Okay, so where is it hurting in your joints right here?
[patient]  Yeah, a little. Also, my feet joints as well.
[doctor]  Okay. And how about when you bend the knee like this?

[doctor]  Good. Well, what brings you in to see me today?
[patient]  Well, my doctor says that I have a heart murmur.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  So I don't know how big a heart murmur I have, or really even what it is.
[doctor]  Okay, so how long have you had that for? Do you have any idea or is that completely new as far as you know?
[patient]  Yeah, she said it to new, worrisome heart murmur. So of course, I'm worried as well.
[doctor]  Got it. Okay. And are you having any symptoms at all?
[patient]  I don't think so. I don't know what symptoms I should be having.
[doctor]  Okay, well, so you are 100 so we can't really get around that one. So I expect that you probably don't move quite as fast as maybe you used to.
[patient]  No, I definitely don't.
[doctor]  Okay, and do you notice that you have any chest pain or F feel shortness of breath?
[patient]  No, I don't have any chest pain. My problem is I have severe pains in my legs, and so she had me going for a chest x-ray, and that was just last week.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  And so I started taking pain pills for my legs.
[doctor]  Okay, got it for the legs. And do you feel short of breath at all?
[patient]  If I walk too fast or too long, or if I try to drink a whole glass of water without stopping, then yeah, I do get sure breath that way.
[doctor]  Okay. And how far can you walk before you feel short of breath or sort of overly fatigued?
[patient]  Well, I do have a walker now so I don't know. Maybe when I walk to the end of the driveway or I walk around the cul-de-sac.
[doctor]  Got it. Alright.
[patient]  So it isn't that bothersome to me at all. Um, maybe more if I try to overdo it.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  Then I um, I get short of breath if I do overdo it though.
[doctor]  Okay, got it. And so how different would you say that the symptoms are now compared to like six months ago or a year ago?
[patient]  I would say probably 70 to 80% from about 6 months ago. Before that I didn't notice anything at all.
[doctor]  Okay, so do you feel like it's mainly the leg pain that seems to limit you?
[patient]  My legs have been severe for about a month now.
[doctor]  Okay, and how about do you feel light-headed or dizzy at all?
[patient]  Yeah, so I do take a pill for that when it does get bad.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  Yeah, I don't take it every day, only when I do feel dizzy.
[doctor]  Okay, and so how about any passing out at all?
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Okay, good. And how about irregular heartbeats? Do you ever feel like your heart is going too fast or like it skips a beat?
[patient]  I don't notice it at all.
[doctor]  Okay great. And how about any swelling in the legs at all?
[patient]  Yeah, my ankle swell.
[doctor]  Okay. And how long has this been going on?
[patient]  I would say for probably six months, but it goes up and down and sometimes it's worse than other times.
[doctor]  Okay. And how about any recent weight gain or anything else like that?
[patient]  I lost a little bit of weight, but I still weigh 120 pounds, but I normally weigh about 130 pounds.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  um... but that's been going down gradually for about a year
[doctor]  Okay, and then how about any fevers, chills or anything else that's going on that you can think of?
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Good. So mainly it sounds like you came in mostly because of the murmur. Is that right? And sort of just kind of seeing what things look like.
[patient]  Yeah, that, and I feel overly tired because I take all that medication.
[doctor]  Okay, and so fatigue as well. And have you ever had any testing of your heart done?
[patient]  I'm not really sure.
[doctor]  Okay, it does look like you've had a decent number of SH. Uh, surgeries here?
[patient]  Yeah, you name it.
[doctor]  All right, well, I won't make you repeat them since I do have a good record. But just give me just a second and I'm going to enter the ones we need, okay? All right, got them. And then are you taking all the medicines that you went through with Madison?
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  Okay good. And looking at your family history, it looks like maybe your brother had a heart attack. Is that correct?
[patient]  It was actually my son, not my brother.
[doctor]  Okay, I'll make that adjustment.
[patient]  um, but my brother did have a stroke. But that was because he had gotten sugar diabetes, and my eldest sister did have a heart problem as well.
[doctor]  Okay, I see.
[patient]  Yeah, so heart problems kind of run in the family.
[doctor]  Okay, all right. Well, it looks like also that you never smoked. That's excellent. And then no allergies to medicines that you know of, is that correct?
[patient]  Correct.
[doctor]  Alright, well, let's do a quick exam.
[patient]  Alright, sound good.
[doctor]  Alright, well for physical exam, please use the regular template. Alright, please just breathe normally. Great. And now take a few deep breaths for me. Alright, do you feel okay? Are you feeling any dizziness or anything?
[patient]  No, I feel fine.
[doctor]  Okay, great. Alright. Well, that is it for the exam.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Alright, so what I'm thinking is let's go ahead and schedule you for an echo cardiogram. It's a very common test and it just takes a picture of your heart and it'll let me see how well your heart is actually working.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  and I can order that for today. Do you have time to complete that? It shouldn't take too long.
[patient]  Yes, that's fine. I have time.
[doctor]  Okay, great. So we will complete that today to assess your overall cardiac structure and function as well as the valve view of where diseased.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  and some hospital outcomes and what we might suggest to fix that out, I'll go over that. So one possible suspicion I'm having is it's called aortic stenosis and that just means that one of your main valves of your heart has narrowed a bit and the valve doesn't really open quite fully. And this could just reduce or block the blood flow from your heart into the main artery of your body and that's called the aorta into the rest of your body.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  And if this is severe, then we might want to perform a procedure called the Trans-Catheter Aortic Valve Replacement, or we just call it Tover. And it is a minimally invasive procedure to replace the valve.
[patient]  Well, I would have to think about that. I'm not too sure I want to do that. Give my age of all.
[doctor]  Yeah, sure, no problem. And we don't have to make any decisions today, just, you know, wanted to go over a couple of these things. But sometimes we can also perform a surgical aortic valve replacement, or it's called an S-A-V-R. But really, because of your age and medical history, unfortunately, that wouldn't be a good option for you.
[patient]  I see. Okay. Well, I guess we'll see what you see from the test.
[doctor]  Yeah, agreed. Okay. And so, couple other things real quick. So, it looked like your blood pressure looked really good today. So, we're not going to change your amlodipine or lysinoprol. So, just continue taking those as you are currently.
[patient]  Okay, good.
[doctor]  And then it also looks like you're taking about 20 milligrams of cymbastatin for your lipids. And I will PR defer to your PCP. However, given you are having leg pain in both your legs and given your age and no history of coronary artery disease, it is possible that you might be able to stop your statin.
[patient]  Really?
[doctor]  Yeah, um, possibly. He would have to evaluate you, but it is certainly something to discuss with him. So I will send over the results of the echocardiogram and also my recommendations, and then you guys can talk about the statin.
[patient]  Okay, that sounds great. Thank you.
[doctor]  You're welcome. And then lastly, your hyperthyroidism, I see you're taking levotharoxin. And again, no change here. And you can just keep taking that as you have them.
[patient]  Okay, I will.
[doctor]  All right, so we will see you back here in about three or four weeks to discuss the results and your next steps. And we'll take care of your echocardiogram today. Any questions?
[patient]  not that I can think of. Thank you so much. And I think it looks good.
[doctor]  Okay, awesome. Alright, well, have a good rest of your day and we'll see you soon.
[doctor]  For physical exam, constitutional elderly otherwise no acute distress. Cardiovascular normal S1 and S2 is preserved with a normal rate and regular rhythm. There is a 4-6 systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border with mild radiation to the carotids. Neurologic gate is normal for age.
[doctor]  for assessment and plan, probably one cardiac murmur. Diana has a 4-6th systolic murmur at the upper right sternal border with mild radiation to the carotids. This is most likely representative of aortic stenosis for symptoms could be due to severe aortic stenosis. However, her S2 is relatively preserved, which would be more consistent with consistent with moderate. Some of her outside records do note diastolic dysfunction. So it is possible she did have an echocardiogram at some point in the past. She does not appear significantly volume overloaded today.
[doctor]  Her next problem is PVCs. Her referral mention, TACCA-cardia. Uh, her EKG today shows sinus rhythm with frequent PVCs, as well as an anterior septum in fart pattern. She does not have any significant palpitations, and we will check an echocardiogram to assess ovra, overall cardiac structure, and function. Depending on results as well as the severity of her aortic stenosis, we will need to consider an ischemic evaluation, or further, possibly a heart-mon monitor to assess overall burden of the PVCs. At this point, she's asymptomatic, so we will start with the echocardiogram only.
[doctor]  Her next problem, hypolipidemia, is managed by her PCP. Due to bilateral leg pain over the last month, considered tovrevaluation following echocardiogram. Staten could be indicated.

• Cardiac murmur.
• PVCs.
• Hypertension.
• Hyperlipidemia.
• Hypothyroid.
• Lightheadedness/dizziness.

PLAN

Cardiac murmur
Diana has a 4/6 systolic murmur at the RUSB with mild radiation to the carotids. This is most likely representative of aortic stenosis. She does have symptoms including a significant increase in fatigue over the last 6 months, shortness of breath, and some lightheadedness. This could be due to severe aortic stenosis, however, her S2 is relatively preserved which would be more consistent with moderate. She is unsure if she has had an echocardiogram, although some of her outside records do note diastolic dysfunction, so it is possible that she had one as some point in the past. We will order a repeat echocardiogram today to assess overall cardiac structure and function as well as valvular disease. If she does truly have severe aortic stenosis, I briefly discussed a TAVR procedure today as she is not a candidate for a surgical AVR given her age co-morbidities and frailty. She is unsure if she would be interested in this, but we will assess first with the echocardiogram and then discuss further at follow-up. She does not appear significantly volume overloaded today.

PVCs
Her referral mentions tachycardia. Her EKG today shows sinus rhythm with frequent PVCs as well as anterior septal infarct pattern. She does not have any significant palpitations. We will check an echocardiogram to assess overall cardiac structure and function. Depending on results as well as the severity of her aortic stenosis, we will need to consider an ischemic evaluation or possibly a heart monitor to assess the overall burden of PVCs. At this point, she is asymptomatic, so we will start with the echocardiogram only.

Hypertension
She is taking amlodipine and lisinopril. We will continue these as is.

Hyperlipidemia
This is managed by her PCP. She is on simvastatin 20 mg. She is having bilateral leg pain over the past month. This could be related to the simvastatin possibly and given her age, it would not be unreasonable to stop the simvastatin, but I will defer to her PCP. She has no known CAD but if we were to do a TAVR evaluation and this was discovered, a statin would be indicated.

Hypothyroidism
She takes levothyroxine for supplementation and will continue this as is.

Lightheadedness/dizziness
She is on meclizine for this. It is possible that some of her lightheadedness and dizziness are related to the aortic stenosis, and we will do an echocardiogram as noted above. She is also having some PVCs on her EKG, which could be contributing, but she does not feel palpitations. We will consider a monitor but start with the echocardiogram first as noted above.

INSTRUCTIONS

Follow-up in 3 to 4 weeks after her echocardiogram is done to discuss results and next steps.

"[doctor]  Hey Charles, I'm using this cool new recording device to help me with my documentation. Is that okay with you?
[patient]  Sure.
[doctor]  Awesome, how are you doing today?

[patient]  You be Hunter.
[doctor]  Huge Hunter I love Hunter ya.
[patient]  I have a refrigerator full of venison at home.
[doctor]  Do you?
[patient]  MM
[doctor]  You want to carry share shore, yet we can switch.
[patient]  Nice, but so the thing is I have noticed that for some reason my breathing.
[doctor]  Isn't what it used to be.
[patient]  Sure.
[doctor]  Yeah, it's you know why I seem to catch my breath a lot more than I used to, and I consider myself to be pretty healthy.
[patient]  You look pretty healthy.
[doctor]  Thanks so do you think you, you're feeling short of breath.
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  Okay, is there you know? Is there any other symptoms that you have with that I get like you know mid shortness of breath suddenly? For some reason, I'm not quite sure why.
[patient] 
[doctor]  Eyes their water doesn't make very much sense to me.
[patient]  MM
[doctor]  I always think it's allergies.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Mostly could be.
[patient]  I have a dog that eyes water like that, she always gets eyebuggers.
[doctor]  Yeah, I get eyebuggers too.
[patient]  Ah
[doctor]  Crazy, at the last time it happened, I went to the urgent care and they gave me a nebulizer that helped.
[patient]  They prescribed me an inhaler that I use now when I feel the symptoms coming on.
[doctor]  Okay, great. Do you ever notice a rash with any of this?
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Do you have any nausea vomiting?
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Besides, when you go out heavy drinking right.
[patient]  I mean, I die a ria, quite a bit once I go out.
[doctor]  I understand that.
[patient]  Heavy drinking.
[doctor]  Yet you ever get lip or throat swelling.
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Have you ever had any issues with allergies in the past?
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  What situations do you notice the symptoms come on when is it when you're near your cat or outside the house?
[patient]  I have noticed them in all three situations.
[doctor]  Hmm.
[patient]  in the house when the cat isn't around and outside as well.
[doctor]  Hmm, yeah, I'm not a big cat person.
[patient]  No neither.
[doctor]  Do you have any symptoms now, while which is?
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  No no travels and no symptoms right now.
[patient]  MM
[doctor]  Okay.
[doctor]  Okay, all right. So I'm going to do a physical exam for you right now. Your vital signs look good. Your pulse is okay. And yeah, your pulse ox is normal. So that's good. You don't appear in any distress. You maybe might be a little bit nervous to come in. And see me, but looks pretty good. I do not appreciate any rash on your body. There is no angiodeima, which is just swelling of your lips like you mentioned no audible strider, which is a bad noise in your airway when it gets swollen. So that's good news if you just want to take a deep breath listening to your lungs on your lungs exam. I do appreciate some faint expiratory weezing bilaterally in all lung fields. So I know you had a chest x-ray when you came and I'm looking at that chest x-ray right now. And your pulmonary function test and they were both normal. So let's talk a little bit about what I think is going on for your first problem. You have newly diagnosed allergic asthma. So I want you to continue the albuterol inhaler. I don't want you to wait until your symptoms flare up or are bad take it. As soon as you start to feel any symptoms at all, I'm going to prescribe something else called singular 10 milligrams. You might have seen some commercials for it.
[patient] 
[doctor]  You take that once daily and that's going to help decrease the occurrences of your asthma.
[patient] 
[doctor]  I also am going to proceed with allergy testing have you ever had an allergy test before?
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Okay, we'll start with skin testing and we'll see if we can target what the triggers and hopes and hopes that we can avoid any any other management. And this can be successful if we can't figure out what it is from that we'll have to discuss more testing in your blood and do immunotherapy. So I want to see you next week to schedule the skin testing. Do you have any questions for me?
[patient]  Should I come my cats?
[doctor]  Yes.","ASSESSMENT

Newly diagnosed allergic asthma.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination, radiographic findings, and pulmonary function test results today, I have had a lengthy discussion with him regarding his current symptoms. He will continue to use the albuterol inhaler; however, he should limit its use to when he is experiencing a severe flare-up of symptoms. I advised he should take it as soon as he starts to feel any symptoms at all. I have also prescribed the patient Singulair 10 mg to be taken once daily. This should help to decrease the occurrences of his asthma. I have also recommended we proceed with an allergy skin test to target what his triggers are in the hope that we can avoid any other management. If we unable to determine his allergens, then we may consider further testing or immunotherapy.

The patient will follow up with me in 1 week for skin testing.",test1
"[doctor]  So Brian, it's nice to see you again in the office today what's going on.
[patient]  I was in my yard yesterday and I was raking leaves and I felt fine. And then when I got into my house about two hours later my back started tightening up and I started getting pins and needles in my right foot.
[doctor]  All right, have you ever had this type of back pain before?
[patient]  I had it once about three years ago, but it went away after a day.
[doctor]  Okay, and did you try anything for the pain yet did you take anything or have you have you tried icing?
[patient]  Put some ice on it and I tried two adveels and it didn't help.
[doctor]  Okay, does it get better when you're laying down sitting standing?
[patient]  Yeah, I think the only thing that helped was a hot shower and it feels a little better when I sit.
[doctor]  Okay, all right, so you said you were raking leaves and now it's been kind of that weather outside for cleaning out the yard Have you been doing a lot of yard work lately?
[patient]  I normally don't do any physical activity.
[doctor]  Yeah, I hear you, I make it, I make my husband do all the yard work too. So, all right, let me take a look at that low back if you bend over, does that hurt?
[patient]  It hurts a little bit when I bend over yes.
[doctor]  Okay, how about when you stand back up?
[patient]  No pain.
[doctor]  Okay, so no pain on extension, some pain on flexion. How about when I push right here on your back?
[patient]  Yeah, that hurts.
[doctor]  Okay, so some pain to palpation right around the L5 can I have that?
[patient]  What happens when family members chime in like I'm doing right now? Because I actually think it was it hurts more when he stands up because I've watched him bend over, but it's when he stands up that it really hurts.
[doctor]  Okay, and what's your relationship?
[patient]  Partners
[doctor]  Okay, so your partner is here with you today and reports that he is also having pain when you are standing up.
[patient]  I've spent so many times you know who I am.
[doctor]  So that's right, you always come in together, have you noticed anything else partner when when he is?
[patient]  I'm worried about it because he is you know his pain tolerance is so high and he wouldn't be saying anything if it really wasn't a problem because it's not at all like last week when he thought about raking leaves but didn't actually rake leaves but then his back didn't hurt as much but this time it really hurts.
[doctor]  Okay, so you think this is more of a long term injury.
[patient]  No, he was just thinking about it hurting when he thought about raking, but it didn't.
[doctor]  Okay, all right, and have you noticed any, any prior pain with the back?
[patient]  I don't want to take this away, you better go back to talking to him.
[doctor]  That's alright, let's see how it turns out okay. So how about if you, if I push down on both your feet like this, can you push back up on my hands?
[patient]  Can you repeat that?
[doctor]  If I'm pushing down on your feet, can you push push your feet back?
[patient]  Bye.
[doctor]  Alright, so your dorsiflexion is normal looks like pulses are equal in all extremities. You said you had a little bit of a tingling sensation in which leg.
[patient]  That would be my right leg.
[doctor]  Okay, so some tingling in your right leg. All right, so I know that you had an x-ray when you came in because we always do x-rays when we have our patients come in of your low back and everything looks normal from that perspective. So for your back pain sounds like you probably sprained your low back. So what I want you to do is let's rest and I'm going to prescribe some mooxicam. Have you taken that before?
[patient]  I have not taken the locks of cam.
[doctor]  Alright, so I'll prescribe that I'm also going to prescribe some physical therapy. I know you said you haven't been overly active and your partner reported the same thing for a long time. So we might want to get you into some point and hopefully get you back back in shape, get you some stretches that you can do and some exercises. And then you know if it's not improving, I want you to send me a message. And we can possibly look into see if there is anything else going on potentially, an MRI, if it's still not. Improving does that sound like an okay plan.
[patient]  It sounds reasonable.
[doctor]  Alright.
[patient]  I think you should have an MRI now. I think he had surgery yesterday. I think you should have an MRI now. This, it's been hurting for like six hours now. And she had an MRI. We are really worried about it.
[doctor]  Alright, you know, let's give it a couple of weeks and let's give it two weeks and then call me back and we'll get you in a Mariah if it's still not improving.
[patient]  Good answer.
[doctor]  Alright, alright, hope you feel better.","ASSESSMENT

Low back sprain.

PLAN

The examination findings and x-ray results were discussed with the patient and his partner today. I recommend we treat this conservatively with rest, meloxicam, and formal physical therapy. If he fails to improve, we can consider obtaining an MRI for further evaluation.

The patient will follow up in 2 weeks.",test1
"[doctor]  Hey Gregory, good to see you today. So take a look at my notes and I see that you're here. You've had a non-healing foot ulcer. So can you tell me how you're doing? How long have you had it? What's going on with it?
[patient]  Sure, so I've had it for about two months now, and it's recently become red and is draining, so I was concerned about how it healed.
[doctor]  Okay, and when you got it, would you have any trauma to your foot or it just just did it pop up all of a sudden?
[patient]  I think I may have gotten it from walking barefoot on the beach.
[doctor]  Okay, alright, and I saw you. You did see your PCP before you came in. Did they put you on antibiotics?
[patient]  They did start me on some medication, but I didn't I didn't pick them up from the pharmacy yet.
[doctor]  Ok, do you know which ones that they prescribed for you?
[patient]  I don't recall the name exactly.
[doctor]  Don't recall, alright.
[patient]  Something I had taken it before.
[doctor]  Okay, so when you at beach did you go to when you heard it?
[patient]  I'm sorry.
[doctor]  So, I was asking which beach did you go to when you hurt your foot?
[patient]  And I was a dewy beach in my ambulance.
[doctor]  Dewey Beach, wow, that sounds like fun. I wish I could be a maub right now, but all or as lucky as I guess is you are to go to Dewey Beach. Okay, so does it hurt?
[patient]  It's sometimes it throbs, doesn't I don't have specific pain, but sometimes it does feel like there is some throbbing going on, and again, my biggest concern is that it started a drain, and it looks a little red.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  I haven't had that before.
[doctor]  Okay, and that makes sense alright, so as far as your diabetes you know, and I think that's probably a major cause of this not being able to heal how well or how well is that controlled.
[patient]  I take my medication, but I don't check my sugar all the time.
[doctor]  Okay, do you?
[patient]  I'm not really sure how.
[doctor]  Okay, do you know what your last A1C is? I'm pretty sure you dok talk to you about it.
[patient]  I think they told me it was around 10.
[doctor]  Around 10 okay. Yeah, that's definitely pretty high. Yeah, you definitely. If your PCP hasn't gotten created treatment plan for you definitely need to go back and see them so you can get that controlled. All right, so let me do a quick physical exam on your foot here. Today your vital signs look normal. You don't have a fever. So let me just take a look at your foot. So on your foot exam, there is a one by two inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot. So it's just proximal to the fifth empty P joint. There is some redness, some drainage present. You have some adema around it. There is fluid like you said that's coming out of it. I don't see any necrosis. You don't have any odor and I don't appreciate any bony exposure. So it pretty much is like you said it's red it's swollen. I think you have an infection in there as well. So when I touch it does that hurt.
[patient]  No, I feel like increased pressure, but it's not distinct.
[doctor]  Okay, all right, that's good. So before you came and we did get an X-ray of your right foot, and there is no evidence of osteomyelitis that means that luckily you don't have a bone infection. So that's great. I think it's just in your skin. So let's talk a little bit about your assessment and plan. So you do have that diabetic foot ulcer. And what I want to do is I want to order an ABI ankle-breakal index just to determine the blood supply. In your foot to see if we can actually heal that ulcer, I'm going to also perform a debridement here just to take off some of that dead tissue. And then I'm going to prescribe you some clindamycin. You can do that 400 milligrams. You take that for seven days, take that twice a day just to try to get rid of that infection, which you currently do have. And now we'll get rid of some of that, that redness and endrainage that that's happening right now to your doc. Did your PCP give you a surgical shoe something that you would? Where while this is happening.
[patient]  Didn't they mention that you may be able to give it to me?
[doctor]  Okay, yeah, we could definitely get you a shoe because if you wear your regular shoes that pressure on that foot can really irritate it and take you backwards. So I'll get you a shoe where you can wear that for the next month. You know, we just want to make sure that it does heal. And then I want to see you back again in two weeks. And we can will possibly do another debridement at that time. We'll just take a look and see how the tissue is doing. So how does that sound?
[patient]  That sounds great.
[doctor]  Alright, do you have any other question?
[patient]  I do if anything happens in between.
[doctor]  Please feel free to call the office. Yeah, please feel free to call you call the office. We can definitely get you and you know if you're having any other issues. And if it's an emergency, if you feel like you're getting a fever feeling, well, please go to the urgent care, or the year if you feel getting black, or anything like that. But otherwise, we'll see you back in two weeks.
[patient]  Okay, sounds great thanks document.
[doctor]  Alright, great.","ASSESSMENT

Right diabetic foot ulcer.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. I have explained to him that his x-rays did not reveal any evidence of osteomyelitis. I have recommended that we obtain an ankle brachial index to determine the blood supply in his foot. Debridement will be performed. A prescription for clindamycin 400 mg 2 times per day for 7 days will be provided as he does seem to have an infection. He will also be placed in a surgical shoe to provide increased support for the next month.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me in 2 weeks to assess his progress and for possible repeat debridement. He has been advised to call the office if his symptoms worsen and we will get him in sooner, however, if he starts to develop a fever or necrosis he has been instructed to go to the ER.

"[doctor]  So Stephanie Morales is a 36-year-old female today complaining of her ankle pain, and she also has a history of diabetes and high blood pressure, so Stephanie tell me what's going on with your ankle.
[patient]  Well, we had a long spring and the other day we got some snow and ice I was walking to my car and I slipped in my left ankle kind of turn underneath me.
[doctor]  Okay, and so this happened a couple days ago or how many days ago?
[patient]  Two days ago.
[doctor]  Two days ago, okay, and so it's your left ankle and it kind of just twisted underneath you on the kind of on the inside.
[patient]  You're more on the outside of my hips.
[doctor]  And did you fall down or did you just kind of cut catch yourself?
[patient]  No I fell.
[doctor]  Okay, and were you able to get up afterwards or somebody helped you up?
[patient]  I was but it was very sore and then started swelling in quite a bit of pain so it's hard to walk.
[doctor]  Sure, have you tried anything for pain or the swelling or anything like that?
[patient]  I'd be profan some ice and elevation.
[doctor]  Okay, has that helped much or not really?
[patient]  A little bit.
[doctor]  Okay, and any pain above your ankle does it hurt on your on your calf or your lower leg at all or knee at all?
[patient]  Now it's mostly just the outside of my ankle.
[doctor]  Okay got it and no bleeding or I'm sure it's a little swollen probably.
[patient]  It's swollen but no bleeding.
[doctor]  Well, have you take off your shoes in a second? We'll examine you in a second, but since you're here, and I wanted to talk about some of your other things that you know we have and I haven't seen you in a year. So let's talk about your history of diabetes, as well as you taking them at Foreman, house, your blood sugars, and how are you managing that any issues with that?
[patient]  No, they've been pretty stable.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  So with my diet.
[doctor]  Good.
[patient]  So
[doctor]  You're checking your sugars regularly as well.
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  Okay, your hemoglobin A1c last time I looked at Epic was about 6. A, which is really good. So, I think you're doing a great job we had talked about, you know, cutting off the sweets and sugars and stuff like that and exercising. So, it sounds like you're doing a pretty good job with that. Have you seen the ophthalmologist recently for your eye exam for your diabetes checkup or no?
[patient]  I am due for one of those in the next couple of weeks.
[doctor]  Okay, all right. So, will so you do you already have an appointment or do you need to make an appointment for that?
[patient]  I have an appointment.
[doctor]  Perfect excellent, okay. And how is your blood pressure been? I know we watching it your blood pressure today looks pretty good, it's about 170. Over I'm sorry, 120 over 70, you're taking norvask any issues without any do need any refills or anything.
[patient]  I need a refill on that, yes.
[doctor]  Okay, all right. Well, let me examine you here for a second. So I'm going to go ahead and do my match exam and I'm just going to verbalize some of my findings. So I can put that into my record. Okay. So your neck exam is fine. There is no roots. Your lungs are clear. Your heart exam is normal. You do have a two over six histolic ejection murmur. You had that in the past unchanged from before. So that's not really worried about that. Your belly exam is good on your ankle exam on your left ankle. You do have some tenderness over the lateral malleolus. And you do also have some tenderness over this bone here, which is the fifth metatarsal. So I don't see any. There is some swelling. There's some redness, but there is some pain with valgus stressing of your ankle as well. And let me turn off my phone here. And also you do have otherwise normal sensation, normal pulses. So on your so my diagnosis for your ankle is I think you probably have an ankle sprained, but I would like to order an x-ray of your ankle because you do have some tenderness over this bone. And I'm sometimes worried about a fracture. So I'm going to go ahead and get an x-ray. I'm going to put you in a splint. We're going to put you in an air splint. And I'll give you some crutches until I get the x-ray back. I want you to do just avoid weight bearing just to make sure there is no fracture there. I will give you some nappers and 500 milligrams twice a day for pain control. Keep it elevated. Put some ice on it. I think those are all good things. And if the x-ray shows a fracture, I'm going to go ahead and give you a call back and we'll send you to orthopedics. But right now let's try this air splint. If there is no fracture, I will probably have you take off the air splint and do some partial weight bearing. And see how it goes. Does that sound like a reasonable plan for you?
[patient]  That's a great plan I need to get back to exercising so.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  Thank you.
[doctor]  Perfect, and for the diabetes, keep the eye appointment that you already have you know, continue with them at Foreman. I'm going to order another hemoglobin. A1c today will check some baseline labs, as well since it's been a while, since we checked them. And then once if you have any issues or you know, give me a call, we can get you into the office. And for the high blood pressure, I'll go ahead and refill the norvask today. You're doing a great job with that. It sounds like continue to monitor that if something changes, certainly call me. We can get you in sooner, okay.
[patient]  Thank you.
[doctor]  Sounds good, sounds good, great seeing you, thanks Stephanie.
[patient]  Thank you.","ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Left ankle pain.
- Medical Reasoning: Given the nature of her injury, I believe this is an ankle sprain.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I advised the patient that I will contact her with the results of her x-ray, and that if these reveal a fracture, we will put in a referral to orthopedics for further evaluation.
- Medical Treatment: X-ray ordered to rule out fracture. We will place her in an air splint and have her ambulate with crutches to avoid weightbearing until we get the x-ray results. She will start Naprosyn 500 mg twice daily for pain control. Continue with ice and elevation.

2. Diabetes type 2.
- Medical Reasoning: This appears to be well controlled with her current regimen.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged her to keep her appointment with ophthalmology for her diabetic eye exam.
- Medical Treatment: We will keep her on her current dose of metformin and order a repeat hemoglobin A1c. We will also obtain a set of baseline labs.

3. Hypertension.
- Medical Reasoning: She is doing well with Norvasc.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged her to continue with home monitoring and knows to contact the office if needed.
- Medical Treatment: We will keep her on her current dose of Norvasc. A refill was sent for this today.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

"[doctor]  Okay, highway and well, I understand you're here for you've got a sore on your foot that's not healing is that right?
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  So can you tell me about that how are you doing?
[patient]  Well, I've been doing okay, but I've had this wound on my right foot for a couple of weeks, and it's not getting better. I saw my PCP and they referred me to UI. I used to see a podiatrist and a couple of years ago, but they moved and I wasn't able to get another one.
[doctor]  Okay, and how long have you had the wound?
[patient]  about 2-3 weeks.
[doctor]  Okay, have you had any kind of trauma to that foot?
[patient]  No, I bought a new pair of shoes to travel with and the neuropathy. I guess I didn't feel that they were too tight at first. It was just a blister, but it looked a lot worse now. I've been putting a band-aid on it. And...
[doctor]  Okay, and so did your doctor put you on any antibiotics when they saw your foot?
[patient]  Yes, I finished the course yesterday the wound looked about the same though.
[doctor]  Okay, now does it hurt?
[patient]  No, I can't feel it.
[doctor]  Okay, now have you had any other symptoms like fever chills drainage from the wound or anything along those lines?
[patient]  No, but when I take my sock off sometimes it sticks to the wound, even when I put a bandaid on.
[doctor]  Okay, well you still wearing those same shoes that cause the problem.
[patient]  No I'm upset.
[doctor]  I'm so upset, too I love those shoes.
[patient]  No one's so upset, I love those shoes.
[doctor]  Okay, so what kind of shoes are they?
[patient]  They're Hocus.
[doctor]  Also, where did you get them?
[patient]  I got them at Ray a couple of years ago.
[doctor]  They're pretty good about helping you to fit your fit you in a shoe aren't they?
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  So, what do you like about them?
[patient]  They are comfortable, they are easy to take on and off, and they provide good stability.
[doctor]  That's good, so you've had some issues with stability sometimes, or...
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  Okay, okay, well another question I want to ask you is how is your diabetes doing?
[patient]  I don't think it's too bad my last Himo Globen A1C was a little over 8.
[doctor]  Okay, all right. Well, let me just do a quick physical exam. Okay. For vital signs, your temperature is 98. When your vital signs look good, your heart rate is 72 respiration, 16 blood pressure is 110 over 65. Okay. So on your foot exam, let's see there is a 1 by 2-inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot. It is just proximal to the right fifth to the fifth MTP joint. And there is some yellow slew present with minimal granulation tissue. There is no surrounding erythema or cellulitis. And there is no evidence of fluid collection. There is no necrosis there. Is no odor? I do not appreciate any bony exposure on on vascular exam. There are palpable bilateral femoral and papilladial pulses. There are no palpable DP or point pulses. But Doppler signs are present. Okay. So does this hurt when I touch it here?
[patient]  Now it's okay.
[doctor]  Okay, all right. So I've reviewed the results, your right foot x-ray that we did before UI came in a room, and this shows no evidence of osteomyelitis, which means there is no evidence of bone infection, so that's really good. So let me tell you a little about my assessment and plan for you. So for your first problem, your diabetic foot ulcer, so I want to order an ankle-break ill index ABI to determine the blood supply to your foot too. See, if you can heal this wound, I'm also going to perform a debridement here in the office to take off some of the dead tissue. And then next, I'm going to prescribe a collagenase ointment to be applied to the wound once daily, and then cover with a dry sterile dressing. Now we will continue this until we see the wound shrinking and a nice pink tissue is present. And I want you to wear a surgical shoe to take pressure off of the area. Okay, so I don't think any more antibiotics are needed at this time, and I want to see. You again in two weeks, so we may need to refer you to. A vascular specialist, if the ABI indicates your blood supply, is not optimal for wound healing okay.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Okay, so for your diabetes, it's going to be very important to get your diabetes under control in order to get the wound to heal. So we might even go ahead and get a diabetic consult so that we can go over some some maybe some ways you can modify your diet without it being too much, but maybe that can bring down your hemoglobin A1C into a little bit better level, okay?
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Alright, do you have any other questions?
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Okay.","ASSESSMENT

1. Right foot diabetic ulcer.
2. Diabetes.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient regarding his current symptoms. I have explained to him that his x-rays did not reveal any evidence of osteomyelitis. At this time, I have recommended that we obtain an ankle brachial index ABI to determine the blood supply to his foot to see if he can heal this wound. I have also performed a debridement in the office to remove some of the dead tissue. I have prescribed a collagenase ointment to be applied to the wound 1 time daily and instructed him to cover with a dry sterile dressing. He will continue this until we see the wound shrinking and the nice pink tissue is present. I have also recommended that the patient be placed in a surgical shoe to take pressure off the area. I do not think that antibiotics are needed at this time. He may need to see a vascular specialist if the ABI indicates that his blood supply is not optimal for wound healing.

Regarding his diabetes, I explained the need for controlling his diabetes and the effects this will have on wound healing. I have recommended a diabetic consultation to discuss diet modifications to bring his hemoglobin A1c to a better level.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me in 2 weeks to check on his progress.",test1
"[doctor]  Hey William, so I see that you injured your knee could you tell me a bit about what happened.
[patient]  Yeah, I thought it was a good idea to go to the trampoline park with my wife and her to snap an instant pain when I was on the trampoline.
[doctor]  Okay, alright, and so, do you go to the trampoline park often?
[patient]  I don't think that's the issue.
[doctor]  Okay, so this is the first time you'd ever done something like that.
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  Okay, all right. I just want to get like a few more details. Do you like workout regularly? Was this for fun or for like an exercise class?
[patient]  No, it's just for fun.
[doctor]  Okay, and do you have a regular exercise regimen at all?
[patient]  Try to not consistant with it.
[doctor]  Okay, no that's fine. This is not a place of judgment. I just I'm just trying to understand like if a little bit more of the background okay So we wanted the trampoline park which kneewear did you hurt?
[patient]  My right.
[doctor]  Okay, you're right knee. And so, based on like you're inside, an outside, which part hurts more.
[patient]  It's kind of the outside of the knee.
[doctor]  Alright, so the lateral aspect, not a problem, and you said that you heard a pop when you landed right.
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  Okay, have you taken anything for the pain?
[patient]  Just Tylenol.
[doctor]  Alright, so did the Tylenol help.
[patient]  Not really.
[doctor]  Okay, alright, and so, when does it have you tried anything else like, did you ice it use heat anything like that?
[patient]  No, I just kind of elevated it and that was about it.
[doctor]  Okay, that's fine. And how long ago did this happen?
[patient]  A week ago.
[doctor]  Okay, alright, so you put up with the paint for a week. That's I'm proud of you for that.
[patient]  I don't like to come to the doctors.
[doctor]  Excuse me, I feel rejected right now. Why would you say something like that? It's fine, but you know I like it when you're not here either. Because that means that you're doing a good job. So let's see about like getting your knee fixed up, but I want to talk about some of the other issues that you have first. So we know that you have hypertension, right? And I discussed maybe you're getting a blood pressure cuff because I needed you to measure those a bit more regularly. Did you get the cuff?
[patient]  What know?
[doctor]  No, okay, that's fine. Have you measured your blood pressure recently at all?
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Okay, are you still taking your medication because I see you're on 20 milligrams of lysiniprol?
[patient]  Your most days I remember.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  Alright, I'm not suspicious, but we're just going to go with that okay. Because looking at your vitals, it is still a bit high. I'm not really comfortable. I see like 180 over you know 80 and...
[doctor]  That's not where we want to be, so I wonder if we might need to adjust your medication, but let's talk about your diabetes, how are your blood sugars?
[patient]  I think they're a little bit better.
[doctor]  Okay, what makes you think that have you been taking them?
[patient]  Yeah, I check it, you know, most days again, kind of when I remember.
[doctor]  Okay, how often are you checking it?
[patient]  I would say 4-5 times a week.
[doctor]  Okay, you might want to switch to maybe two or three times a day, but you know that something I'm glad that you are measuring are you taking your metformin.
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  Okay, and then I think we have you on 500 milligrams correct.
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  Alright, how is your diet?
[patient]  kind of the same as my exercise decent could be better.
[doctor]  Alright, and okay, not a problem. So what is your deal? Are you measuring your calories at all looking at your macros? Are you just eating what you feel like?
[patient]  It is trying to watch what I eat more than anything, but nothing specific.
[doctor]  Okay, and are you do you know if you're particularly focused on your salt like is it like a low salt diet?
[patient]  No, just trying to watch my cards a little bit more, but not counting or anything.
[doctor]  Alright so like is it a specific diet? I just want to make sure like are you on like the keto diet?
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Okay, all right, not a problem. So if you don't mind, I'm going to go ahead and do a quick physical exam as I mentioned before your blood pressure. It's a little high as I listen to your heart, I do like it's got a nice regular rate, and rhythm I don't appreciate any murmur when I listen to your lungs, they sound clear bilaterally. I would like to look at your knee though, so when I press here on the outside, does it hurt?
[patient]  Little bit.
[doctor]  Okay, and then when I press on the inside does it hurt?
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Alright, can you bend your knee and straighten it?
[patient]  How can I think that's all I can I can bend?
[doctor]  Alright, so are you having problems walking? Can you bear weight?
[patient]  I can, but I have a little bit of a limp.
[doctor]  Okay, so do you mind getting up and walking for me really quickly? All right, so I do notice that there is a slight gate like there is a small sorry, you are correcting, you do have a limp-eye, I am a little worried about that, but it's probably, it's probably the superficial. When I'm looking at your knee, I do notice some like echamosis and edema that just means bruising and swelling along the lateral aspect of your knee. I don't notice any effusion and it looks like you have a decent range of motion, but I do understand that you know you're experiencing pain with some movement. Okay, I'm going to go ahead and order an x-ray and when you come back we can have that discussion all right, so I review the results of your right knee x-ray which showed no evidence of fracture or bony abnormality. So let's talk about my assessment and plan all right, so for your first problem of right knee pain, I think you have a lateral ligament strain I want to prescribe some maloxic am, which is going to be 15 milligrams daily for pain and swelling. I'm going to refer you to physical therapy to help strengthen the muscles around the area and to prevent further injury if you're still having pain we can do further imaging imaging, but like this is a common injury that tends to heal on its own for your second problem with hypertension. I want to continue the lysinopril at 20 milligrams and order an echo. I am concerned that we might not be getting your blood pressure to where we need it to be so we might have to do some medication modification for your third problem with diabetes. I want to order an a1c I know that you said you have been measuring your blood sugars, but I think this would give us a better image of what's been happening long term and I also want to order a lipid panel in case we need to make any adjustments to that medication as well. Do you have any questions?
[patient]  Sound good.
[doctor]  Alright, awesome.","ASSESSMENT

1. Right knee pain, lateral ligament strain.
2. Hypertension.
3. Diabetes type 2.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, his symptoms appear to be consistent with a lateral ligament strain of the right knee. I am going to prescribe meloxicam 15 mg once daily for pain and swelling. I also put in a referral for physical therapy so he can work on strengthening the muscles around the area and prevent any further injury. We can consider further imaging if he continues to have pain, but I explained that this is a common injury that typically heals on it's own.

For his hypertension, I'm concerned that his blood pressure is not well controlled at this time, so we may need to modify his medication. I'm going to order an echocardiogram for further evaluation, but I want him to continue taking his lisinopril 20 mg for now.

For his diabetes, he stated that he has been measuring his blood glucose levels 4 to 5 times per week, but I want him to start measuring them 2 to 3 times per day. His hemoglobin A1c levels should provide more detail as far as his long-term progress so we will order that today. I'm also going to order a lipid panel and we can determine if any adjustments need to be made to his medication. In the meantime, he should continue taking metformin 500 mg.

"[doctor]  Hey Matthew, I see here that you've had some back pain for a while and your PCP sent you over to see me how are you doing today?
[patient]  Pretty good, I'm feeling pretty good. Don't like the weather, you know. I've been sitting in the waiting area for, you know, 30 minutes. And that definitely makes the symptoms worse.
[doctor]  Okay, well first of all I agree with you the weather has kind of been all over the place been hot and been cold and then now it seems like we've had a week of pretty chilly weather hopefully that changes pretty soon so tell me a little bit about when your back pain started and then what happened there?
[patient]  We want to hear the long story or kind of the short story because my back has been bothering me for a long time.
[doctor]  So, let's do the readers digest a version.
[patient]  while i can't really time i choose you know standing really makes it bad you know i go to the mall it really really i don't know all i've just been better than
[doctor]  Okay, and I know it got real bad about a month ago that's what the report here from the PCP said but can you tell me exactly where the pain is in your lower back can you kind of point to where that's at.
[patient]  Yeah, it's right here and you know like 30 years ago when I fell off the roof, it was really, really bothersome. They said maybe there was a fracture or something and you know, I just couldn't play football and then I had to you know kind of try to take care of myself, but you know it's been really bad for about a month.
[doctor]  Okay, and then do still have that pain that radiates down your left leg sometimes.
[patient]  You have course, yet goes all the way through here.
[doctor]  Okay, and then so it looks like you pointed to your lower back area and then pointed down through your hip and down into your to your left leg. Can you describe that pain for me?
[patient]  It's like electrical tooth ache and it goes down the whole leg.
[doctor]  Okay, and can you rate that pain for me right now, zero being none ten being the worst pain you've ever been in in your life?
[patient]  Right now it's less bad, I didn't take my medications because I wanted you to see me as as I am, but it's 6 out of 10, but when it gets really bad, I'd say it's 13 out of 10.
[doctor]  Okay, and anything that you do make it feel better you mentioned that you know sometimes sitting or laying down anything that make that better.
[patient]  You know, like I said, the only thing that seems to make it better is laying down.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  You know, standing walking seems to make it worse, coughing, sneezing makes it worse. And you know, I had a friend that saw you and you know, you burned some nerves or something like that. And so I was just seeing if there was something that you could do to get me out of this pain. And hopefully you can do it today.
[doctor]  Okay, and then any numbness or tingling in in your lower extremities or any weakness there in your legs.
[patient]  You know what it's my back that's weak and my legs are weak, both of them. You know, coughing, sneezing seemed to make it worse, so sorry. I'm just trying to be like a typical patient, because most patients they don't answer the darn questions. So you know all this time, I still haven't gotten a chief complaint out of them. So I love the way that you're trying to redirect. And so, you know what your doctor said you had back pain and leg pain, but for me, the most important. Think for me to capture is that. It's in the hip side of the leg side of the calf, goes to the big toe. And so I need them to be able to give me a perfect sort of root signature. So I can hone in is that four five dissing on the MRI really significant or is it on the opposite side? But again, I'm sorry. I'm purposely trying to be in a difficult patient because some of these patients, he asked them 50 different questions. They won't answer any of them. So anyway, sorry about well.
[doctor]  That's okay.
[patient]  to explain, but this is what I deal with every single day.
[doctor]  Absolutely.
[patient]  A lot of pain, you know, what my pain is eight out of ten, it goes into the back, goes into the hip side of the leg side of the calf, goes to the big toe of my foot kind of drags. When I walk, I've been having to use a cane. Nothing seems to make it better. And, but very few patients will give you the perfect history and most people will start talking about, you know, when something happened or go back to 30 years ago and you want to redirect them to their current. Symptom, but the patients won't rarely ever. Tell you what the chief complaint is you got to pull it out of them.
[doctor]  So let's take a quick look at you here, okay? Let's do a physical exam real quick. So your vitals look good, which is a good thing now in your back exam. I don't see any bony abnormalities, no redness, or no, and no bruising present. Now, do you have pain when I press here?
[patient]  No, it's right here.
[doctor]  Okay, so positive for pain to palpation at the L4 vertebrae. And if you bend forward, do you have pain there?
[patient]  It hurts all the time, especially sitting in these runoffest desks.
[doctor]  Okay, so you are positive for pain with flexion and extension of your back. I'm going to go ahead and test the strength of your legs now push out against my hands for me please.
[patient]  Okay, that's it, that's all I got.
[doctor]  Alright, so 4 out of 5 strength in the left and 5 out of 5 on the right does look like that reflexes are brisk and motor and sensory is intact in both lower extremities. I do want to review the results of your MRI. The MRI shows a disc herniation at the level of L4-L5 vertebrae and it is associated with some nerve-root impingement. And what that means is the nerve is being compressed by that herniation. So let me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan okay so for the diagnosis. Of a acute disc herniation at L4-L5 with that nerve-root impingement that's causing that pain down your leg and your lower back pain. Now I know you've tried NSADS in the past without relief and you've done some point. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to recommend an epidural steroid injection. And we're going to do that today for you if you agree to it what that means is going to place some anti-inflammatory medication right. At the spot of inflammation and once that's in place I want to refer you back to point and we want to strengthen that area of K or young and otherwise healthy. I think you'll do well but it can take about two to three weeks for that injection really to take full effect. So then I want you to see point and I want you to see me again in about a month are you okay with that treatment plan.
[patient]  Sure sounds good.
[doctor]  All right, sounds good. I'm going to have the nurse come in and get you prepped and then we'll get that injection for you.","ASSESSMENT

Acute disc herniation at L4-5 with nerve root impingement.

PLAN

I have recommended that we treat the patient conservatively with a epidural steroid injection and formal physical therapy. With the patient's consent, we will proceed with a epidural steroid injection into the lumbar spine today. He will follow up with me in 4 weeks to check on his progress.",test1
"[doctor]  Hi Jacqueline, how are you doing today?
[patient]  I'm doing okay. I'm just really anxious about my recent blood work that my PCP did and said that I have hepatitis C. I'm just really surprised because I've been feeling fine.
[doctor]  Okay, so were you ever told in the past that you have hepatitis C?
[patient]  No never.
[doctor]  Okay, and do you have any history like for drug use known that you know or do you have any known to have any like hepatitis C positive partners?
[patient]  I mean like years ago I used to party a lot and even used four drugs but I've been clean for over 15 years now.
[doctor]  Okay well very good you know congratulations on that that's that's a great great achievement so tell me though how about alcohol use.
[patient]  I used to drink a lot, a lot more alcohol. Now, I probably would say I drink about a beer a day.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  and maybe slightly more on the weekends, but nothing like how I used to.
[doctor]  Okay alright how about smoking have you ever smoked?
[patient]  I do smoke I'm down to 1-2 cigarettes a day. It's just really been tough to just get rid of those, too. But I've cut down a lot I used to always up to 1 point or a pack and half a day.
[doctor]  Wow, okay, all right, so yeah, you definitely have decreased that. So that's again good for you on that one. So hopefully you keep you keep that up.
[patient]  Thing.
[doctor]  So tell me do you have any other medication conditions?
[patient]  Do I know otherwise? I'm feeling pretty good. I had my physical. There was nothing else to the only thing I was telling my PCP. Is I do feel like tend to be really tired at the end of the day after working, but otherwise I've been good.
[doctor]  Okay, and has work been not hard lately you've been busy it sounds like?
[patient]  I know I've been busy, but not really much more than usual.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  So that's why I was kind of marking because I mean I used to you know be able to be fine, but I just lately have been feeling like I'm getting enough sleep, but I still get very tired at the end of the day.
[doctor]  Okay, all right, well, I hope you're not working too much and then you'll able to at least find some time with the family.
[patient]  Yeah, am I yeah, I tend to be a workaholic, but yes, I am working on that.
[doctor]  Okay, well I hope kids are doing okay.
[patient]  There, thank you.
[doctor]  Okay, good. So tell me what conditions, what kind of conditions, run in your family. Like, is there do you have hypertension diabetes or?
[patient]  Y'all have all of the above.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  hypertension diabetes and also depression.
[doctor]  Okay, and depression, okay. All right, well, let's go ahead and do a quick physical exam on you. Here, I reviewed your vitals and everything there looks good. So that's good. And now on general appearance, you appear in no distress and no jaundice on skin exam. Let me go ahead and listen to your heart here, great on your heart exam. You have a nice regular rate and rhythm with a two out of six, six, systolic murmur appreciate appreciated. That's that hasn't changed from last year. So we will just continue to monitor that monitor that as well. Okay.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Alright, now let me listen to your lungs here very good, so your lungs are clear with no weasers' rals or a ronkey, and let me go ahead and listen to your abdomen great your bowel sounds or present your abdomen as soft with no hepatosplino splenomegaly can't talk to appreciated. So let me now check your musculoskeletal exam. Here great, I didn't see any gate disturbance and no edema, so that's great so, Jacqueline I did. Review the results of your recent blood blood work and your HCV antibody. Test was positive and your liver panel that was done showing an elevated AST at 39, but your all-tall human and total bilirubin were all within normal limits. So what that all means, and let me go ahead and tell you about my assessment, and plan here for your first problem of hepatitis C or initial labs are consistent with hepatitis C, so based on the once I just discussed with you there now hepatitis C, is a viral infection that affects the liver, so you most likely may have had it for. Years now, so the next step that I would like to do is to confirm the diagnosis with some additional blood work that includes checking the hep C RNA, and also the HCV genotype okay. Now I would also like to determine the severity of your liver disease by checking for fibrosis of the liver, and I'm going to do this by ordering a special ultrasound, and with this information I'm going to be able to know how to proceed as far as treatment.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  All right now I know that was a lot of information. Do you have any questions for me?
[patient]  Yeah, so should I be worried about my wife and my kids? Should they be tested as well?
[doctor]  Yes, so we can start with the same screening that you have had for you for all of them first okay.
[patient]  Okay, all right, so I'll make sure I'll have them set up an appointment with our family doctor.
[doctor]  Okay, great. So if you don't have any other questions, I'm going to have the nurse check you out and get all that scheduled and I'm going to see you in about three weeks.
[patient]  Alright, perfect.
[doctor]  Alright.
[patient]  Thank you.

"[doctor]  Alright.
[patient]  Good morning, Julie. How are you doing today?
[doctor]  I'm doing okay. I'm just a little nervous about what's been going on with my headaches.
[patient]  Okay, so I know you were sent here by your PCP. What was your understanding of why you were sent here?
[doctor]  Yes, so I actually have been someone who's been struggling with headaches for years now ever since I was a teenager and they used to be around my when I would have my menstrual, my mencise, but as I got older I noticed that it has been with that and also I can get it when I'm really stressed but recently and why I went to her is because my headaches have been getting a lot more, they've just been happening a lot more frequently and a lot more severe.
[patient]  Okay, can you tell me a little bit about them? What, how do they feel when they come on?
[doctor]  So they say mostly on my right side. And it even seems like it's like behind my eye and it just like this pulsing like this really bad pulsing sensation.
[patient]  Okay, do you notice these any activities or time of the day that makes them worse? I know you said that they seem to get worse around your menstrual periods, but is there any time of the day or that makes them worse?
[doctor]  I have noticed that you know I've been trying to exercise more in order to lose weight, but I can't even really exercise for very long because I start of as soon as I start to jog, I my headaches, the headaches come back on a lot worse. So I notice it when I'm exercising.
[patient]  Okay, and do you seem to have any other symptoms when you get these headaches? I've been having a ringing in my ears for a few months now. And then what really scared me is that now I'm starting to get some blurred vision. It's not all the time, but it will come and go, but some blurred like on the...
[doctor]  in my own side of my vision.
[patient]  Okay, okay, and have you experienced any numbness or tingling to your hands or feet or your face?
[doctor]  No, I haven't.
[patient]  Okay, so you like to run a lot. What kind of do you do you use a eight-good shoe? You know, what kind of shoes do you use for your running?
[doctor]  Yeah, I am starting to get back into it. I'm a big new balanced person in A6. So yeah, those are the two brands I like to wear. Yeah. So right now I'm using A6.
[patient]  Okay, yeah, I like to run too and I use Nike.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  I used to get tumor guy, but I really kind of moved over Nike.
[doctor]  Hmm.
[patient]  That's good you know what is running is a great exercise.
[doctor]  It is.
[patient]  So have you had any, let's get back to the exam here. Have you had a recent MRI of your brain? I saw one from a few years ago. But as Dr. White said, anything about getting a more recent MRI.
[doctor]  Yes, she was going to put one in, but she wanted me to see you first and urgently, so they haven't called me yet for the MRI.
[patient]  Okay, so that's good, I think we will follow up with Adam or I. But let's go ahead and take a do a quick physical exam here. I reviewed your vitals that the assistant collected when you came in and everything that looks good, including your blood pressure, you know, with symptoms like that. That's one of those things that I'd be concerned about.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  Now on your heart exam, it sounds like it's normal sinus rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. So that's good as I listen on a go ahead and look here in your eyes, the fundoscopic exam shows papalodema. And that's just some of swelling behind there in the eye. And this let me do neurological exam. This will take a few minutes you get up to follow my instructions as we go through that. Okay. On neurological exam. Craneal nerves, one through 12 are intact, including a normal cranial reflex. And just want to watch you walk across the room here.
[doctor]  Okay, turn around, come back, and okay, so on musculoskeletal exam your gate is normal.
[doctor]  Okay, go ahead, sorry.
[patient]  That's okay for your first problem. Your headaches, your symptoms are concerning for what we call idiopathic intracranial hypertension. And this is a condition that you have increased pressure in the end of your head and your brain without any known cause for it. Now, patient also presents with often present with symptoms such as yours, you know, headaches worsening with activity, ringing in the ears changes in your vision. So I'm pretty confident that that's what we're having here now why we get. Concerned is if the pressure continues to increase this can lead to some permanent changes in your vision. So I do want to get a few more tests just so we can confirm that diagnosis. And the first one that we just talked about is an MRI. I think it's really important to get that a check for any other condition that could be contributing to your symptoms now. Once I have that result, I'm going to be doing also doing a spinal tap, which will help me evaluate the pressure in the brain and it can also help you feel better if you do have an increased pressure by taking the decreasing the amount of that pressure. Just by taking a little bit of fluid off of that. And lastly, I want you to be seen by a neuro-oft homologist for a complete, I exam now. I know that sounded a lot of information, but I think it's really important we get that accomplished. Do you have any questions for me?
[doctor]  Yeah, that is a lot. And so I am sure I'll have more that comes up, but so let's say we do all this test. And it confirms what you're saying does that mean was I referred to you? Because that means I will need surgery.
[patient]  Not necessarily if you have idiopathic intracranial hypertension, there are a number of medications that we can try to help decrease that pressure in your brain. And this will also help you have less headaches when you exercise as exercise and weight loss are also an important part of the treatment.
[doctor]  Okay, all right, all right, and I'll probably add something about so is this something I'll be doing soon? Is this all things I'll be doing this week?
[patient]  Yeah, that's a great question here. I'm going to go ahead and we're going to, for the MRI, I'll have to get a pre-approval from your insurance company. I will work on that my, my, my team in the front office will get that pre-approved. And then once that's done, we'll call you to help schedule that MRI.
[doctor]  Okay, alright, thank you bye.
[patient]  by sorry","ASSESSMENT

Headaches, concern for idiopathic intracranial hypertension.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regard to her current symptoms. I have recommended that we obtain an urgent MRI of the brain to evaluate for any other condition that could be contributing to her symptoms. We will contact her to schedule this after approved by insurance. Once the MRI results are available for review and further discussion, I will also perform a spinal tap to evaluate the pressure in the brain. I have also advised her to be seen by a neuro ophthalmologist for a complete eye exam. Questions were invited and answered today. The patient agrees to the treatment plan.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me once the MRI results are available for review and further recommendations.",test1
"[doctor]  Alright, so hey, it's nice to see you, Jack. I know you've been experiencing some neck pain. Could you tell me what happened?
[patient]  Yeah, so I was an A car accident.
[doctor]  Hmm.
[patient]  And I hid in the back and my neck went forward and my head went forward really quick and so I've been having some pain ever since.
[doctor]  Okay, and so, with this pain how long ago was the car accident?
[patient]  That was about a week ago.
[doctor]  Okay, with this pain like on a scale of 1 to 10, how severe is it?
[patient]  I would say it's about a seven.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  It's not a constant pain, but whenever I move my head, which is like a lot I feel it.
[doctor]  Alright so, where exactly is it on the side on the back?
[patient]  It's in the back of my neck.
[doctor]  Okay, has anything made it better?
[patient]  I mean, I've tried some ibuprofen to help a little bit, but not too much.
[doctor]  Hmm.
[patient]  just about 5 out of 10.
[doctor]  Don't worry, and did you say whether the pain was getting worse?
[patient]  I mean it's been staying the same, it just gets worse when I'm moving my neck.
[doctor]  Okay are you able to turn your neck from side to side?
[patient]  Mostly, but there is there is pain with it.
[doctor]  Okay, and then, do you have headaches?
[patient]  Yeah, I had a couple early on.
[doctor]  Ah, ah.
[patient]  I've had it lately.
[doctor]  Okay, and so does the pain move anywhere like your upper back your shoulder.
[patient]  No, it just stays on Monday.
[doctor]  Okay, and then any kind of hearing, any kind of hearing problems, visual disturbances.
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Okay, have you ever played sports before or had a sports accident before?
[patient]  Yeah, I played football.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  Years ago, but I didn't have any issues with my neck though.
[doctor]  Okay, and then when you got in the car accident, did you end up going to the emergency room?
[patient]  No, I mean I know that going to the emergency room that like the English rides like 500 bucks, so I didn't want to do that.
[doctor]  I understand I understand okay. Was there any like swelling or bruising on your neck?
[patient]  Not that I know about no other mag of my neck, I really can't see that.
[doctor]  Yeah, okay, no just checking, okay. So if you don't mind, I'm going to go ahead and do my physical exam. So when I press on here on the side of your neck, does it hurt?
[patient]  Yeah, a little bit.
[doctor]  OK positive pain to palpation of the soft tissues of the neck, what about when I press on your back or your shoulders?
[patient]  Now that's fine.
[doctor]  Okay, so when you flex your neck, when you're touching your chin to your chest does that hurt?
[patient]  MM
[doctor]  Alright, positive pain with flexion. What about when you move it back?
[patient]  Yeah, that hurts worse.
[doctor]  Okay, okay, severe positive pain to extension okay. So can you turn your head from side to side? Does that hurt?
[patient]  Yeah, a little bit.
[doctor]  OK, positive pain with rotation, and then can you touch your ear to your shoulders.
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Okay, all right, so positive pain on lateral bending. Wow, this is pretty, this is pretty serious, not serious necessarily sorry about that. So I reviewed the results of your x-ray, but the results show no signs of fracture or bony abnormalities. But let's go ahead and talk about my assessment and plan for you. I believe what you have is something called next strain for your neck pain. I sorry treatments. We are going to go ahead and treat this a bit. Conservatively, you're I'm going to put you on anti-inflammatories. Motron 600 milligrams and you're going to take that every six to eight hours. I also want to give you a muscle relaxant called flexural and it's going to be 10 milligrams and you'll take that every 12 hours is needed. I'm going to want you to try your best to like relax your neck. I'm sorry not to strain your neck anymore. Like to be conservative with how you move about and everything like that. I also want to order an MRI just because you said you didn't go to the hospital or anything like that. I just want to make sure that you're not suffering from like a concussion, but this is something that's commonly referred to as like whiplash, right? Your head just like it. It just wiped essentially like back and forth to so severely. And that's probably what's causing your pain. I think I want to refer you to either physical rehab or a chiropractor once we get the results of the MRI just to make sure that there isn't any impingement of like the nerves or anything like that. Do you have any questions?
[patient]  I heard the chiropractors will shake they work.
[doctor]  I do understand that some people have like reservations about going to the chiropractor, but you know we do have some good ones that have like longstanding histories and patients that have had positive results from the experience. But if you if you don't like the idea of that we can consider other options like that rehab and physical therapy.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  All right, any other questions?
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  All right, thank you.","ASSESSMENT

Neck strain.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. We discussed his x-rays did not reveal any signs of a fracture or bony abnormalities. Treatment options were discussed and conservative treatment has been recommended. He will begin taking Motrin 600 mg every 6 to 8 hours. A prescription for Flexeril 10 mg every 12 hours as needed was also provided. He was advised to be mindful of how he moves his neck and to be conservative to avoid straining his neck. I have also recommended that we obtain an MRI for further evaluation as the patient did not go to the emergency room following his accident. He will also be referred to either physical rehab or a chiropractor pending his MRI results.

"[doctor]  Hey, Hi Bobby, how are you doing?
[patient]  I'm doing good, how are you?
[doctor]  I'm doing fine so I understand you're here having some left or some right shoulder pain that you've had for a few weeks now.
[patient]  It was I was doing some work in my backyard and a lot of different projects going on and you know I was obviously sore all over the next couple of days but my right shoulder just keeps on bothering me and it keeps it's just really sore and it just hasn't been going away.
[doctor]  Okay, so have you had ever had any pain in that shoulder before?
[patient]  A little bit, I you know, I hurt that same shoulder because it's my dominant hand, my right hand, I hurt a playing baseball when I was younger.
[doctor]  Hmm.
[patient]  So, I've always had a little bit issues, but this is it doesn't feel like it's in the rotator cuff, it's kind of more on the outside, and it's kind of like it's more tender on the outside when I raise my arm up so.
[doctor]  Okay, yeah are you able to move your arm very well or not?
[patient]  Yeah, there's no restriction with my arm. It just, I definitely feel some pain on the outside of it.
[doctor]  Okay, and are you having pain all the time? Or just or does it come and go?
[patient]  Just whenever I move it if I'm sitting still I really don't notice anything. But whenever I move it then I can definitely feel some pain.
[doctor]  Okay, how about at night? Is it bothering you at night also?
[patient]  a little bit because I sleep on that side so.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  Of course.
[doctor]  Okay, and I may mis-did you say what have you been taking for pain for that?
[patient]  I've just been taking some Advil and then icing as much as I can. So that's about it.
[doctor]  Okay, and does that seem to help or?
[patient]  A little bit, yeah, a little bit. I mean, it's still like, you know, sort of touch, but it definitely dulls a little bit.
[doctor]  Well, sounds like you have quite a few projects going on, what all are you doing for your yard? And...
[patient]  I will let's see I've been putting an outdoor shower and we're extending our patio putting making some flower boxes putting down some you know for stone and all the flower beds so my wife's really put me to work I got a laundry lift
[doctor]  Wow, it sounds like a variety of projects, but if you're putting down stone, you're probably lifting those as well. And then...
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  Yai Bet that is sore now. Tell me this have you experienced any numbness in your arm or your hands or?
[patient]  No not really no numbness that I can think of.
[doctor]  Okay, all right. So CM and I'd like to do just a quick physical exam and I've reviewed your vitals, those look good, you're no fever. So that's good, you're 97. 8 and your heart rate looks good at 62 respirations, 16, your blood pressures, 116 over 84 that looks fine, your oxygen saturation is real good at 99%. So that all looks good. So let's take a look at your left at your right shoulder. So you have limited active and passive range of motion and there is some tenderness at the great tuberosity of the humerus. There is no tenderness at the sternoclavicular or acroecromioclavicular joints. You do have a good hand grip. Okay, and on neurovascular exam of your right arm, your capillary refill is less than three seconds and your sensation to touch is intact. So I've reviewed the results of your shoulder x-ray and there is no fracture. So that's good. So let me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan. So for your first problem, the left shoulder pain, your symptoms are most likely due to this rotator cuff, rotator cuff tendonopathy that means you that you injured, injured the tendons of the muscles. That helped make your shoulder muscles. I think we had to go ahead and order just an MRI since you have had some problems before as well to make sure there's nothing else going on with it. And I also want to refer you to physical therapy for approximately six to eight weeks and so during that time, continue the Tylenol. And if your symptoms don't improve, we can go ahead and consider a steroid injection of your shoulder which could provide. Some relief. Do you have any questions about your plan?
[patient]  No, that sounds good.
[doctor]  Okay, all right, yeah, a lot of patients, it's very successful with the physical therapy, so I really hope that we'll do it. And so we'll just start there, okay.
[patient]  Sounds great.
[doctor]  Okay, thanks.
[patient]  Thanks.
[doctor]  Did you have any other, any other problems, any other injuries that went along with this or?
[patient]  My both my my feet are actually really sore too. I obviously have been doing a lot of other yard work. So, you know, it's kind of really stiff and stuff. And then you know my ankle joints as well. My wife seems to think that I don't drink enough water. So it could be something along that lines. But I don't know they're kind of this. They're just really sore and stuff. So I've been trying to put them up and kind of put ice on them. Keep them elevated and it seems to be helping out a little bit. But...
[doctor]  Yes, so if you don't feel that you did anything to injure it, we might start just maybe do some Epsom salts. Have you tried soaking your feet in Epsom salts that will tend to kind of pull out what's going on in there and just help you those muscles to relax and the soreness to go away you might try that?
[patient]  Okay, that sounds like a plan that sounds good.","ASSESSMENT

1. Right shoulder rotator cuff tendinopathy.
2. Bilateral foot pain.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. I have explained to him that his x-rays did not reveal any signs of a fracture. I have recommended that we obtain an MRI of the right shoulder to evaluate for a possible rotator cuff tear. I have also recommended that the patient attend formal physical therapy for 6 to 8 weeks. He can continue taking Tylenol as needed for pain. If his symptoms do not improve with physical therapy, I will recommend a cortisone injection.

In regards to his bilateral feet pain, I have recommended that we treat the patient conservatively. I am recommending the patient soak his feet in an Epsom salt soak as well as elevate as needed.

"[doctor]  Mr. Jackson is a 45-year-old male who has a history of diabetes type 2 and mild intermittent asthma, and he is here today with right elbow pain. So hey there Mark, nice to see you again. Listen, sorry you're having some elbow pain, let's talk about it. But I would like to record this conversation with this cool app that I'm using that's going to help me focus on you a bit more wood that be all right with you.
[patient]  Yeah, that sounds great.
[doctor]  Okay great, so mark tell me about your right elbow pain, what's been happening.
[patient]  So I've been playing a lot of tennis recently, buddy of mine. You know you're always telling me to get off the couch. And be more active. So a buddy of mine asked me if I wanted to go play tennis, he just joined a country club. I've been hitting the court a lot more. And it's just been killing me for the last three weeks or so.
[doctor]  Okay, alright. And where in your elbow is it hurting?
[patient]  outside port.
[doctor]  Okay, does the pain radiate anywhere like down to your arm up to your shoulder or anywhere else?
[patient]  No, it doesn't.
[doctor]  Okay, and what would you say the pain is you know on a scale of 0 to 10?
[patient]  It's probably an 8 when I'm just when I'm using it even if it's to get something out of the cupboard and it's a 3 when I'm just kind of resting.
[doctor]  Okay, and do you say it's a sharp pain stabbing pain aching throbbing? How would you describe it?
[patient]  all of the above shooting stabbing very sharp.
[doctor]  Okay, alright, and you let's see other than the the tennis, you know, increase in tennis activity you haven't had any trauma recently falling on it or you know, fell to pop anywhere, or anything like that have you.
[patient]  Not that I can recall.
[doctor]  Okay, and you said it's its worst with movement better with rest. Is there anything else that makes it makes it worse or makes it better?
[patient]  I've taken some Tylenol and ibuprofen, but as soon as those were off it comes right back, so they don't really help.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  And I did try a little ice, I probably should ice it more, but I didn't notice it helping much.
[doctor]  Okay, okay, all right, yeah, well, I definitely am glad you're getting some exercise now that's good for your diabetes and all that and out there playing tennis kind of back back to the back to the old days for you, right, did you I recall that weren't you a big tennis player back in the day like state champ in high school or something.
[patient]  Yeah, yeah, that was 100 years ago. I can't, I try to play like that. And I can't, I can't do that anymore. But yeah, good memory, that's a good memory.
[doctor]  Now
[patient]  Kind of tennis guy too, right did you see that the Australia opened?
[doctor]  I did I did yeah, that was that was crazy. That was a great tournament what a what a finish unbelievable.
[patient]  Yeah, how did you see the masters I know your golfer?
[doctor]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't get out as often as I as as I like to but but the masters yeah that was that was amazing That was a lot of fun to a lot of fun. Did you catch it too?
[patient]  I did.
[doctor]  Yeah
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  Yeah
[patient]  But that's what I couldn't believe Tiger went out there, of course he did.
[doctor]  Right.
[patient]  It was cool to see nothing.
[doctor]  Yep, yep, agreed, agreed. And so while listening, we'll hopefully get you feeling better here and get you back out on the court and out on the course. And we'll talk about that. But let's let me ask you about your diabetes a little bit a little bit here. So how have your blood sugars been running? Mark, have they been what in the low 100s, 200s? Where are they?
[patient]  They're like 151.60, you know we just had Easter and my kids got a whole bunch of candies. So I keep eating that.
[doctor]  Okay, yeah, yeah, understood. So those cowboy eggs they'll get you every time to write.
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  Boy my gosh, yeah those are the best. So those are those are deadly don't tell my cardiologist. So okay, so listen You know I see that we have you on met four men 500 milligrams once a day no actually last visit We increased it so I've got you on met four men 500 milligrams twice a day correct. You're still taking that
[patient]  Yes, twice a day.
[doctor]  Okay, and but your blood sugars are a bit off, you know, maybe those the Cadbury eggs. So how about your asthma? How has that been doing? You know, have you had any asthma attacks? You're still taking flow event twice a day and the albuterol is needed.
[patient]  You're not going to want my asthma is pretty much under control.
[doctor]  Okay, excellent, excellent, alright. And I recall, you know, just kind of review a few things I think you've got an allergy to penicillin, is that correct?
[patient]  That's correct, yes.
[doctor]  Okay, and then you know your surgical history, you had your gallbladder out what about 10 years ago? I think by Dr. Nelson correct.
[patient]  Yes, that's right.
[doctor]  Okay, and then let's go ahead and examine you alright. So mark your exam is pretty much you know for the most part normal with a few exceptions on your heart exam. You still have a grade three out of six is Stolic ejection murmur. And that's unchanged from prior exam we're watching that. And so that just means I hear some some heart sounds as your heart is beating there I'm not too concerned about it, as as that's not changed otherwise normal. Cardiovascular exam and your physical exam otherwise on. Your musculoskeletal exam on your right elbow you do have moderate lateral epicondler tenderness of the right elbow. And how about when I move this when I move your elbow like this does that hurt you.
[patient]  Kills.
[doctor]  Okay, sorry about that, so you've got moderate pain with passive range of motion of the right elbow. There is no palpable joint effusion, and now what if I press against your wrist like, so does that hurt you?
[patient]  It hurts a little bit.
[doctor]  Okay, all right, sorry. So that's you have mild pain with resisted extension of the right wrist, as well, okay? Otherwise, normal, unremarkable exam. And let's talk about your results now. So your right elbow x-ray today shows no acute fracture or other bony abnormality. So that's good. There's no malalignment or sign of joint effusion. And otherwise, it's a normal right elbow x-ray. So that's reassuring, okay? And hey, you know I meant to ask you. No. And do you have any history of fever recently? You know. Along with the elbow pain, you had noticed a fever.
[patient]  know what i think so
[doctor]  Okay, great excellent. Alright, so tell you what let's let's talk about my assessment and your plan here so for your first problem my assessment is is that you have a cute lateral epicondylitis of your right elbow and this is also known as tennis elbow go figure right. So this is due to overuse likely the increase in your tennis activity which normally would be good but maybe we're overdoing it a little bit. So I have a few recommendations I'd like you to rest your right arm as much as you can I want you to stop tennis for the next four to six weeks and please avoid repetitive stress in that right arm as well. I want you to ice that right elbow for 20 minutes at least three times per day and this should reduce the pain and inflammation and then I'm also going to give you a brace for your right forearm and my nurse will give this to you before you leave that should help with the discomfort okay in that right elbow. I will also write you a prescription for ultram and this should help with the pain. I'll write you a prescription ultram 50 milligrams once per day that should help with your elbow pain so then I want to see you and follow up in four weeks and so we'll reevaluate your elbow at that time and if you will consider some additional imaging if needed possibly a physical therapy referral depending on how you're doing MK now for your second problem of diabetes type two my assessment is is that your blood sugar is a little bit out of control MK so we need to make some adjustments I'm going to increase your metformin to 1000 milligrams twice per day and I want you to check your blood sugar twice daily for the next two weeks and then let me know how your blood sugar is running and we can make some additional adjustments if needed but I will increase your metformin to 1000 milligrams twice a day now I'm going to also order a hemoglobin a1c level and and a cbc blood test today and and so we'll check those results the hemoglobin a1c and the cbc and then I'm going to also check a chem 12 blood test as well and now for your third problem of the mild acute intermittent Nazmi umi assessment is that it really remains under good control so let's keep you on that flow vent and the albuterol no changes there and you can use those as tolerated it does look like you need a refill on your albuterol so I'm going to write you a prescription for a refill of the albuterol and you can pick that up your pharmacy as well so how does that all sound any questions for me
[patient]  It sounds pretty good I can't believe it's just tennis elbow feel like a looser coming in here, but it's okay. I get it.
[doctor]  Yeah, yeah, well.
[patient]  I'm not I'm not young anymore.
[doctor]  Yeah, well let's keep you active, but take a break for a bit, and let's ease back into it okay. So it's great to see you, and I'll see you back in for weeks. Let me know if you have other problems in the meantime.

"[doctor]  Alright, so how are you doing today Angela?
[patient]  I'm doing pretty well.
[doctor]  All right, so looking here at your appointment notes, it says, you're here, you think you have a kidney stone, you had some in the past. So we're going to take a look at that. And then you also have a past medical history of hypertension and diabetes. We want to take a look at those as well. So first thing what's going on with your kidneys, you as what how long ago have you been feeling pain? And how's all that?
[patient]  Pain's been up and down. I went to the emergency room last week, but now I think I'm doing a little bit better.
[doctor]  Okay, so the case of kidney stones. So have you had you said you've had them in the past and how often would you say?
[patient]  I don't know why this is probably like my seventh or eighth kidney stone.
[doctor]  Seven or eight kidney stones. So do you think you passed it yet or is it still in there?
[patient]  I think this one passed ya.
[doctor]  This one passed how long would you say it took to?
[patient]  Well, I went last week and then I think it passed about three days ago.
[doctor]  Okay, so are you still noticing any blood in your urine?
[patient]  No, no more blood.
[doctor]  All right, are you still having pain?
[patient]  Nope.
[doctor]  Yeah
[patient]  The pain's gone.
[doctor]  Okay, that's really good. Did they do anything for you at the hospital giving you any medications?
[patient]  They gave me some pain medicine.
[doctor]  Okay, do you remember what it was?
[patient]  i think it was percussed
[doctor]  Okay, well that's good. I'm very glad to see that you were able to pass that stone have you seen a urologist before about this.
[patient]  I haven't seen one in a while, but yes I saw someone maybe a year ago.
[doctor]  Okay, so yeah, I know you keep having these recurrent kidney stones, so I definitely think we can get you a referral to urology just to check up on that and also want to do some labs as well.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  So I also see you're here for you have a past medical history of hypertension. And when you came in today, your blood pressure was a little bit high. It was a 150 over 90. I'm reading here in your chart. You're on 2.5 of Norvask.
[patient]  Hmm.
[doctor]  Now have you been taking that regularly?
[patient]  I have, but at home I blood pressure is always great.
[doctor]  Okay, maybe you have a little white coat syndrome, some of my patients do have it, I have it myself, and I'm a provider. So I definitely understand, yeah, I know what we talked about last time, you're getting a blood pressure cuff, and taking those about two to three times a week. So what have those readings, but I'm usually like 130 to 140 over 60 to 70.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  That's not too bad. I think when you first came and you were around 180. So it seems to be that that norvask is working for you. How about your diet? I know you were having a little issue eating some fast food. And in cakes and cookies, and have you been able to get that under control?
[patient]  It's hard to give up the fast food altogether because it's a lot of on the go, you know.
[doctor]  Okay, so do you think you would be able to get that under control by yourself or would you do you think you would need help with that maybe a dietician be able to help you out?
[patient]  Yeah, I don't know if I can make another appointment. I just add to the extra.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  Let's start to make food so.
[doctor]  Yeah, yeah, definitely understand.
[patient]  MM
[doctor]  Alright, so I mean that's one thing we just got to work one. As your diet, we try to keep you at least just 2300 milligrams or less of sodium per day I know that's hard for a lot of salads. And stuff I know it's hard for a lot of people especially with all like the pre-packaged foods we have around today. So that's definitely something we should work on.
[patient]  MM
[doctor]  So let's also look here you have a history of diabetes, and so you're on that 500 milligrams of metformin daily. Now have you been taking that as well?
[patient]  Yeah, I take my myth form in.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  So what have your blood sugars been running daily?
[patient]  Well, I don't check it very often.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  But I think they've been pretty good.
[doctor]  Okay, so I'm looking here I think last after your last visit you got A1C now is 6. Seven so it's a little bit high, it's gone down a little bit since you were first diagnosed with the Type 2 diabetes a year ago. So I'm glad we're making progress with that as well alright. So I'm just going to do a quick physical exam on you before I do just want to make sure you're having any chest pain today.
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Alright, any any belly pain.
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Alright, so I'm going to listen to your lungs, your lungs are clear bilaterally. I don't hear any crackles listen to your heart. So on your heart exam, I do hear that grade two out of six histolic ejection murmur, and we already knew about that previously, so it hasn't gotten any worse, so that's good. So I'm going to just press here in your abdomen because that you did have those kidney stones. Does that hurt?
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Alright, I'm going to press here on your back.
[patient]  No pain.
[doctor]  Okay, so on your abdomen exam of your abdomen, I'm showing no tenderness to palpation of the abdomen or tenderness of the CVA either on the right side, so that that's good I think that's pretty much cleared up. So let's we'll talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you. And so my assessment you did have to those kidney stones, but I think they're past this time, but I do want to get a couple of labs, so we'll get a urinalysis.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Alright, we'll get a urine culture just to make sure everything is as cleared up, I also want to give you a referral to referral to urology.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  because you do keep having these all the time and so maybe there's something else going wrong and so they can help get that under control.
[patient]  Can I see Dr. Harris?
[doctor]  Of course, yeah, we can get you that road to Dr. Harris and...
[patient]  He's not like.
[doctor]  He's great. He's he's he's great. I've heard he does really good work. So that'll be good. So for the hypertension, you seem to be doing well on the two. Five of Norvask. So we are not going to make any changes to that. Do you need any refills right now?
[patient]  No usually the pharmacy just sends them through when I call.
[doctor]  Okay great, so we will give you refills with that I do want to give you a consult to nutrition.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  just to help you with that diet.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Because I think that's a major factor of us eventually getting you off of all medications.
[patient]  Hmm.
[doctor]  And then for your diabetes, I'm just keep you on that on that 500-metre form and okay. I think you're doing well with that as well also, but I do want you to start taking your blood sugars if you can take them before every meal.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Just a gauge where you are so you can tell how much food you should actually be be eating.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Alright.
[patient]  I could try that.
[doctor]  So, how does that sound?
[patient]  It sounds like a plan, which should I come back and see you.
[doctor]  So you can come back in three months and we'll check up again. I forgot you did tell me last time that you were having some issues with insomnia.
[patient]  Hmm.
[doctor]  How is that going for you? Is it still happening?
[patient]  I mean sometimes I stay awake just kind of worrying about things but I've tried some meditation apps and that helps.
[doctor]  Okay, alright, and I know we talked a little bit before about practicing proper sleep hygiene, you know, just making sure that all of your electronics are off, you know, dark room.
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  Cool room, have you been doing that?
[patient]  Why do I like to sleep with the TV on and my phone is right by my bed? Because I never know if someone's gonna call me, you know.
[doctor]  Yeah, I know I'm like Apple, I don't know if you have an iPhone or not, but I know Apple has this to the sleep mode now do that disturbance so you put that on.
[patient]  It's a good idea.
[doctor]  interrupt you.
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  Okay have you tried taking melatonin to sleep?
[patient]  I use it a couple times, but it didn't seem to help that much.
[doctor]  Okay, how about I don't think I've prescribed you anything, yet do think you would need anything.
[patient]  I don't really want to take any sleeping pills.
[doctor]  Okay, that's understandable. Alright, so for the last issue for the insomnia, I'm just gonna have you take 10 milligrams of melatonin as needed.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  And just try I guess the best is possible to practice the proper sleep hygiene so you can get to sleep at night and then feel pretty rested.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Alright.
[patient]  MM
[doctor]  So, do you have anything any other questions for me?
[patient]  No, that's all.
[doctor]  Alright, so we will see you in three months.
[patient]  Okay sounds good.
[doctor]  Alright.

"[doctor]  Hey Betty, how are you doing?
[patient]  I'm doing okay. I've just been really frustrated because with my asthma, and it just seems like I can never catch a break, never get better. I'm always, it seems like I'm always coughing and wheezing.
[doctor]  I'm sorry to hear that what normally triggers your asmetype symptoms.
[patient]  I find it's really really when I get sick if I get sick with a cold. I almost always know that my asthma is gonna flare. I did notice one time though that when I went to my aunt's house, I had a flare afterwards and I think it's because of her cat. So I try to avoid going there and I haven't really had an issue since.
[doctor]  Okay, so now you mentioned that that happens somewhat a lot how frequently does this occur that you have these breathing type problems.
[patient]  It seems like it happens really every month or every other month of the past six months. I usually end up going to urgent care a lot and get my primary care doctor. And so sometimes they'll give me antibiotics. Sometimes I'll get steroids one time. It was so bad I actually ended up going to the emergency department.
[doctor]  Wow, that can be a little bit scary. So you mentioned that your primary care provider or the urgent care provider gave you medications. What medications are you using for your asthma right now?
[patient]  I have two inhalers one, but I really just use one of them. It's a blue one. It seems like the only inhaler that helps me the other one. When I try to use it, it doesn't work.
[doctor]  Okay, so do you think that's the Albuterol inhaler? Is it do you remember the name like Ventilin or?
[patient]  Yes, yes, that's the name of it.
[doctor]  Is that okay? Alright. And then how often do you feel like you need to use that?
[patient]  I would say like almost every day, I feel like I'm using my inhaler because I'm always coughing and wheezing and a couple of times a night. I'll wake up as a couple of times a week, I'll end up waking up needing to use my inhaler as well.
[doctor]  Okay, and then when you use it, at that time does it help.
[patient]  It does.
[doctor]  Okay, and how many walk me through how you use that you just wake up and you take one puff or is it two puffs?
[patient]  Yeah, I take I usually take two paths.
[doctor]  Okay, but then you get enough relief that you can go back to sleep.
[patient]  Yeah, for the most part.
[doctor]  Okay, now have you ever needed to be hospitalized? Due to your asthma symptoms, you mentioned you've had to go to the ER.
[patient]  Yeah, for only once I can think of when I was young, I think like around eight years old. I had to be hospitalized, but nothing since then.
[doctor]  Okay, I do want to take a little bit of a deeper dive here into your ear and urgent care visits. Can you tell me a little bit more about those?
[patient]  Yeah, I feel like I've had several. I don't remember the exact number, but I've had several this past year. They almost always have to start me on Prednisone.
[doctor]  Okay, like a prednisone taper pack that type of thing.
[patient]  Yeah, sometimes they'll just give me like a large dose over five days.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  And then sometimes they make me take less and less and less, so the over like nine or ten days.
[doctor]  Okay so both the dose back and then also the high dose as well okay.
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  And then when was your last exacerbation?
[patient]  Probably about a month ago.
[doctor]  Okay, so just out of curiosity, you mentioned that you have trouble when you go over to your aunt's house because of your cat now, I see here that you really like to go outside and walk and do those type of things. Do you have any other type of issues whenever you go outside, any any seasonal allergies or anything like that?
[patient]  No, not really.
[doctor]  Okay, so you don't have any history of seasonal allergies, which is good. So it looks like here that you put down that you enjoyed hiking, so you don't have any trouble getting out and going hiking, and have you tried the new trails there behind, behind the rec center.
[patient]  Yeah, I'm really excited, I mean I have to be careful because I know with my coughing, my wheezing, but I'm really looking forward to getting better, so I can really start hiking again.
[doctor]  Okay, now I really need you to be truthful when you answer these next questions. This is important for taking a good history. Do you smoke any type of cigarette or tobacco product and have you ever smoked or do smoke marijuana on a regular basis?
[patient]  No, I've never smoked and I don't vape either or yeah, don't smoke cigarettes from marijuana.
[doctor]  Okay, and then you said you don't vape, so no vaping or e-cigarette use it all.
[patient]  Hmm.
[doctor]  Okay, and then are you routinely in an area where there is a lot of airborne particular like smoking in bars or around any type of a, you know, like racetracks or anything like that?
[patient]  Sometimes I go to the bars with some friends, and yeah, the smoking does irritate me.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  So, I'm going to try to go there often.
[doctor]  Okay, thank you for sharing that with me, so if it's okay with you, I'd like to go ahead and do a quick physical exam.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Now I reviewed your vitals for today, and your blood pressure is good. It's 128 over 82 your respiratory rate is 16, and your oxygen saturation is 99% on room air, which is a good thing I'm going to take a listen to. Your heart here, your heart is regular rate and rhythm, and I don't appreciate any ectopic beats or, and I don't hear anything like rubs, murmurs or gallops, which is good, so I'm going to go take. And listen to your lungs here on your lung exam. I do appreciate some diminished lung sounds throughout with the occasional slight expiratory wheeze, and that's bilaterally. So I hear that on both sides, I'm going to go do a quick neck exam here, neck is suppletrakeia, is midline. I don't appreciate any lymphed anapathy taking a listen. Here I don't appreciate any carotid brute. Now I'm also going to take a look at your hands. Here I note strong bilateral pulses. I don't appreciate any clubbing on. Any of your fingertips, which is which is important, and I also note brisk capillary refill. I'm going to go ahead and review the results of your pulmonary function test that I had you do when you came into the office today. And reviewing those results, I do see that they're consistent with somebody who would be diagnosed with asthma. So let me go ahead and tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan. So now for your first problem of asthma, your symptoms are consistent with moderate to intermediate or I'm sorry moderate, moderate intermittent asthma. And it's going to be really important for us to be consistent with your inhaled inhaled steroid inhaler. So I'm going to need you to take that as prescribed. And that's really going to help cut down on those daily symptoms and needing to use that rescue inhaler that albuterol inhaler as frequently. So the more you take and more consistently you take your inhaled steroid inhaler, the less you will use your albuterol. Now it's not a fast acting. Inhaler like your albuterol. But what is important is is going to be what? Helps you long term now if you do have an acute exacerbation. So if you're having an acute issue with your breathing, I do want you to continue to use your albuterol inhaler one to two puffs. And then I want you to wait and see how you're breathing. Is before you would take an additional one to two puffs, we hope you have less of those acute exacerbations. As you continue to use your inhaled steroid, I'm also going to put together an asthma action plan for you. And that's going to help us look at your symptoms. Symptoms see where your pain points can be, you know, like those being having issues with with cats or dust that type of thing. And we'll work on how to handle those symptoms through that asthma action plan. So do you have any questions, comments or concerns? Otherwise, I will see you in 30 days.
[patient]  All right, thank you.
[doctor]  You're welcome.
[doctor]  So let me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan for your first problem of asthma, your symptoms are consistent with moderate intermittent nasma. I'm going to start you on Flove Ant 110 micrograms, one puff twice per day. That's going to be important for you to be consistent with your inhaled steroid inhaler. This is going to help prevent those daily symptoms and from needing for you to use your albuterol. Inhaler or that rescue inhaler less frequently, you can continue using your Ventiline inhaler and that would be two puffs every four to six hours PRN. I'm also going to put together an asthma action plan for you. So we know what to do based on your symptoms I'd like to see you again in a month or sooner if you have any worsening symptoms. Does that sound okay?
[patient]  It does thank you.
[doctor]  You're welcome, I'll see you in a month.
[patient]  Alright, thanks.","ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Moderate intermittent asthma.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient's symptoms and results of her PFT are consistent with moderate intermittent asthma.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I explained the importance of consistency with her daily inhaler as this will help prevent daily symptoms and the need to use the albuterol inhaler as frequently. My hope is that she has less acute exacerbations as she continues to use her inhaled steroid.
- Medical Treatment: Prescribed provided for Flovent 110 mcg 1 puff twice per day. She can continue using her Ventolin inhaler 2 puffs every 4 to 6 hours as needed. I have recommended using her albuterol inhaler 1 to 2 puffs and then monitor her breathing prior to taking an additional 1 to 2 puffs. I am also going to put together an asthma action plan for her so we know what to do based on her symptoms.

"[doctor]  Hello Larry, how are you doing today?
[patient]  I've been better my primary care doctor wanted me to see you for this back pain that I've been having for a couple of years now.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  And I've tried so many things and just nothing seems to work.
[doctor]  I'm sorry to hear that now do you remember what caused the pain initially?
[patient]  You know, I never fell or was an accident, but I do remember it all happened like I started having back pain after I was moving furniture one weekend.
[doctor]  Okay, and now can you describe the pain for me?
[patient]  It feels like a sharp stabbing pain in my back and it does go down, even down in my right leg. Sometimes all the way down to my toe, it feels like my big toe.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  And I also feel like I just can't get comfortable, which is worse when I sit down, okay, yeah.
[doctor]  Okay now with that do you have any numbness or tingling associated with your back pain.
[patient]  Yeah, I do get some numbness and tingling especially to my right leg that goes down to my foot.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  Let me separate these.
[doctor]  and how about a loss of sensation in the genital or the rectal area?
[patient]  No nothing like that.
[doctor]  Okay, now do you have any weakness?
[patient]  I wouldn't say I have any weakness now.
[doctor]  Okay, do you experience like any loss of control of your bladder or your bowels?
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Okay, now you mentioned earlier that you have some tried tried some things in the past. So tell me what were they.
[patient]  So I tried some physical therapy before and so when it gets really bad they've even had to prescribe some strong pain medications for me. But that was only temporary and they even mentioned surgery to me in the past but I really would like to avoid surgery.
[doctor]  Okay sure so tell me what is your day like.
[patient]  My day, so I try to be as active as I can, but of course it's been difficult with my back pain. And so because of that I have gained some weight over the past years.
[doctor]  Okay, alright, well I'm sorry to hear that I know that you used to like playing golf.
[patient]  Yeah, and you know golf is relatively new for me. I've been trying to get into it, but this has definitely set me back.
[doctor]  yeah i'm sorry yet probably now at the peak of you know just learning it and being able to do more with it this comes and this happens right
[patient]  Exactly.
[doctor]  Well, let's see what we can do for you here. So you can go out into the You Know the Golf Course again. Now, do you tell me do you have any family members with spine conditions?
[patient]  No, I can't recall any family members.
[doctor]  Okay alright, and do you smoke?
[patient]  Not now, I quit about 20 years ago.
[doctor]  Okay, all right, well, all right, well, I like to do a quick physical exam on you here.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  I'm going to go ahead here, I reviewed your vitals and they overall look pretty good. So that's a good sign now on your musculoskeletal back exam. There is no overlying erythema and that just means redness or echinosis and that just means bruising of the skin now there is midline tenderness at L4 L5 disc space with right-sided lumbar paravertibral tenderness. So do me a favor and I'm going to just have you know bend forward and straighten up a bit.
[patient]  Okay, that's painful.
[doctor]  Sorry, so definitely some pain with lumbar flexion and supine straight leg test is positive. So on your neurological examination there is decreased sensation to light touch at the right lateral thigh at all for dermatome, okay? And I'm just going to take a look at your knees here real quick and then your ankles so patellar and Achilles reflexes are symmetrical so good. Now I reviewed the results of your MRI and it shows disc herniation with nerve impingement. So let me tell you about my assessment and plan here Larry so for your problem of chronic lumbar back pain so based on your symptoms your exam and reviewing your MRI results your symptoms are consistent with an l4l5 herniated disc with radical reticulopathy. So this means that one of your discs that sits between your spinal vertebrae is bulging out and this bulge is pinching on some nerves and that's why you feel that tingling in your leg. So yay so I am recommending a spinal injection with a strong inflammatory medication called a corticosteroid and what I do is I will inject the corticosteroid into that lumbar spine under fluoroscopy which you can think of you know an x-ray to help localize to the exact area of your pain now this should this should help the inflammation that is causing the pain. So what do you think about that?
[patient]  Is there something I'm going to have to do all the time?
[doctor]  Well, you know patients are different, so what we do is we will monitor you and we see how you respond to the injection, and the patient's intervals can be different as well, but we usually do not do more than four times a year.
[patient]  Okay, okay.
[doctor]  Alright, and it's not a long procedure, it's relatively quick and common, and you should be out of the office within an hour.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  Alright, sounds good.
[doctor]  Alright, well let's go ahead and get you started on the first one today if that works for you if not we'll get you scheduled to start your first injection.
[patient]  All right, thank you.
[doctor]  All right, thank you.
[patient]  Bye.","ASSESSMENT

With the patient's consent, we will proceed with a cortisone injection into the lumbar spine today.",test1
"[patient]  Hi Kenneth, how are you, the medical assistant told me that you had some knee pain? Yeah, I was getting ready for the holiday weekend and I was out on my boat skiing and I did a jump and kind of twisted when I landed and my knee has been hurting me ever since.
[doctor]  Okay, so that was about five days ago then.
[patient]  Yeah, yeah, that was last weekend.
[doctor]  Last weekend okay, now which knee is it?
[patient]  It's my right knee.
[doctor]  You're right knee okay and I know that it sounds like you were on a motorboat as you were you know water skiing but did you hear anything pop or feel anything pop when it happened.
[patient]  No, it just felt like something stretched, and then it swelled up some afterwards.
[doctor]  Okay, and were you I assume that you were were you able to get out of the water by yourself or did you need some assistance?
[patient]  I was it would get out but it was very sort of climb up and you know any kind of squatting or bending is really pretty sore.
[doctor]  Yeah, okay, and have you ever injured this knee before?
[patient]  No, that was the first time.
[doctor]  That was the first time, okay. Where do you have a boat? What lake do you have it on lake?
[patient]  Lake Martin.
[doctor]  Okay, nice, and so your frequent water skier.
[patient]  Yeah, I try to go every weekend when we can.
[doctor]  That's nice, very, very good. Are you looking forward to spring? Are you a baseball fan? Are you excited? By opening day?
[patient]  No, I'm not a baseball fan, but I love spring and chicken time of year lawns of outdoor activities. Nice, nice. I'm not really a baseball fan either, but my husband makes me watch to the meds all the time, and they lose all the time. So he is always upset. So, so anyway.
[doctor]  Yeah right, so how about your high blood pressure? How are you doing with that? Are you taking your blood pressure medication? Like I asked.
[patient]  I'm taking it every day and I check my blood pressure at home and it's been about 125 over 80 most of the days.
[doctor]  Nice okay, so I believe we have you on liciniprol about 20 milligrams a day, any side effects from that that you're noticing.
[patient]  Not that I know of it's been a good medicine for me, and I don't have any trouble with it.
[doctor]  Okay great alright and since you had this knee pain any numbing or tingling in your foot at all
[patient]  No, just the swelling in the pain.
[doctor]  Okay, and what have you taken for the paint?
[patient]  I took some leave twice a day, some over the counter a leave twice a day.
[doctor]  Okay, and...
[patient]  putting a cool pack on it.
[doctor]  Okay, and how's that helped at all?
[patient]  Yet it's helped a fair amount, it's still pretty sore though.
[doctor]  Okay, all right, well let's see have you ever had any surgeries before. Let me just think any surgeries I don't see any in your in your record here.
[patient]  I have my tonsils out.
[doctor]  Okay, you had your tonsils out, okay? All right, well, let me go ahead. I want to do it just a quick physical exam. I'm going to go ahead and be calling out some of my clinical exam findings. And I'll let you know what that means when I'm done, okay? So looking at your vital signs here in the office, it just looked like you're doing a really good job managing your blood pressure, your blood pressure is up, is about 120 over 77 today herein. The office. And that's with you probably in a little bit of pain. So that's good. And on your neck exam, I don't appreciate any lymphedentipathy on your heart exam, your heart is a nice regular rate. And rhythm, I don't appreciate any murmur on your lung exam, your lungs are clear to osculation bilaterally on your musculoskeletal exam. On your right knee, I do appreciate some echinosis, some edema. There is an effusion present as it hurt when I press.
[patient]  Yeah, that's sore.
[doctor]  Okay, there is pain to palpation of the right medial knee. There is undisclined bend your knee in all sorts of directions. Here does that hurt.
[patient]  You don't do that anymore.
[doctor]  All right, the patient has decreased range of motion. There is a negative varus and balgastus. There is a negative lockman sign. There is a palpable dorsalus pedus and posterior tibial pulse. There is otherwise no lower extremity edema. So what does that mean? Kenneth, so that means that you essentially I agree with you. You had quite quite an injury to your knee and you do have a little bit of fluid in your knee there and just some inflammation, which I think we need to talk about. Okay, so I want to go ahead and just talk a little bit about, you know, my assessment and my plan for you. So for your first problem of your right knee pain, I do believe you have what we call a a medial collateral ligament strain. You know, I want to go ahead and just order an X-ray of your right knee just to make sure that we're not missing any broken bones, which I don't think we are. But what's good about this particular injury is that people typically heal quite well from this and they typically don't need surgery. We can just go ahead and refer you to physical therapy to strengthen those muscles around your knee so that you don't have another injury. And I want to go ahead and just prescribe meloxicam 15 milligrams once a day and that will help take down the swelling and help with some of the pain. And you only have to take it once a day and it won't really cause any upset stomach or anything like that. Do you have any questions about that?
[patient]  Yeah, if I start that medicine today, I'm not going to be able to ski tomorrow because we got a big weekend plan.
[doctor]  I would say I would like you to rest your knee. I think that my concern is that if you go skiing again and you fall that you might injure your knee even more. So I think you'll recover from this injury right now but I don't want you to injure it anymore. So I would rest it for a little while at least until we have the results of the X-ray and that type of thing okay for your second problem of your hypertension. I want to just go ahead and continue on Lycinoprol 20 milligrams a day. I want to just go ahead and order an ellipid panel just to make sure everything is okay from that standpoint and then I'm just looking through your health record and it looks like you're due for a tetanus shot. So we'll go ahead and just give you a a tetanus shot from a health maintenance perspective any other questions.
[patient]  I think so sounded good planned to me.
[doctor]  Okay sounds good alright so I'll see you later we'll get those ordered and I'll be in touch okay take care bye
[patient]  Thank you.","ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

[doctor]  Okay, well first of all, and I'm sorry that you're nervous and what we're going to do is we're going to partner together. And I'm going to be right by your side the whole time to hopefully make you a little less nervous and recognize the fact that we're going to have a big support team around you.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  So let's talk a little bit about how long you've had that cough before you want to see your doctor.
[patient]  You know, often I've had it for about three months. I first noticed it when I was loading some pay. I have horses and I bought you know for a hundred bills a day and when I spend a day loading it and then it's I just started coughing a lot more I think around that time and after that I just got a cold so that's what's simming my PCP now. I do exercise, I do a lot of biking and I typically don't get sick and my cough has gone away.
[doctor]  Okay, that's good to hear you mentioned exercise and biking I love to bike myself. I've got a track 7100 hybrid. Have you been on the new trails? They open it was the old, the old rail, the old railroad. Right away they've opened that up. It's like 60 miles of trails.
[patient]  I love that road, just I don't like riding on the road, so I prefer to do those rails the trails type.
[doctor]  Yeah
[patient]  And it's just so phenomenal I do that a lot.
[doctor]  Yeah, I love riding over their way. We will get you all fixed up we will have to go for a bike ride.
[patient]  Absolutely, I'd love it.
[doctor]  That'd be great. So I see here on your medical history that you also have a history of rheumatoid arthritis is that under control at this time. And what do you do to take care of your eye?
[patient]  Yeah, it's its fear you know arthritis never really goes away, but I take methotrexate.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  I think it's 7.5 milligrams every week, and as long as I'm keeping active, my joints feel okay. And if I do have any problems, it's mostly with my hands, but I haven't had any recent flares. So I'm okay right now.
[doctor]  Okay, that's good. I also see here that you marked down that you were a previous smoker and and when when did you when did you stop smoking?
[patient]  I stopped smoking probably about seven years ago.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  and I was young and should have stopped the way before that my kids were on me all the time. But you know I got a new start and finally was able to stop and I felt better after stopping.
[doctor]  Okay, that's good. And I'm glad to hear that you were able to to stop and and stay to back o' free that that's great to hear do you have any pain or any shortness of breath or anything like that.
[patient]  No not at all.
[doctor]  Okay, and I would like to talk about your familial history here. For just a second, do you have any family history of lung cancer or any other type of malignancies?
[patient]  No lung cancer my mom did have breast cancer, but she's doing well now.
[doctor]  Okay, alright, and then things like lung infections or pneumonia. Do you have any previous history of that?
[patient]  No, no, not not anything that I'm aware of.
[doctor]  Okay, if it's okay with you, I'm going to do a quick physical exam. Your vital signs look good today. Blood pressure of 124 over 76 heart rate of 70 respiration rate of 16, oh, two sat on room air of 98 percent. And you are 8th, so you don't have a fever today. I'm going to take a quick listen to your lungs. Here your lungs are clear and equal bilateral when I listen to them or when I osculate your lungs. Now listening to your heart regular rate and rhythm no clicks, rubs or murmurs, and I don't appreciate any extra beats doing a quick extremity exam your skin as pink warm and dry. I don't appreciate any edema to your lower extremities. It looks like you do have a little bit of swelling to tear knuckles there on your third digit on each hand, which can be normal for somebody who is RA. However, pulses are intact in all extremities and capillary refill is brisk. So a quick review of your results. Now you had a chest CT before you came into see me and the results of that chest CT do show a solitary two centimeter nodule in the lateral aspect of the right upper lobe now. It appears the nodule is smooth in appearance and no evidence of any type of emphysemitis disease is present, which is good now for my assessment and plan for you. So you do have an incidentally found right upper lobe lung nodule. I'm going to order some PFT, which is pulmonary function test. I just want to a check and a baseline for your lung function. I'm also going to schedule a pet CT. This is going to help to determine if that nodule is metabolically active meaning if it lights up it, it can suggest that it's cancer or inflammatory. I'm going to go ahead and suggest that we do remove this during or by a video assisted thoracoscopy, which means it's just going to be three small incisions made on the side of your right chest. I'm going to go in with a camera and a scope and we'll remove that along with a very small portion of your lung. You're going to be under general anesthesia and it'll take about an hour and a half or so post procedure you're going to be admitted and you'll have a chest tube and until the following day and I'm going to go ahead and take that out then at bedside. Most likely you're going to be in the hospital for one night and go home the next day. It could be a benign nodule, but because you're smoking history, I really do think it's going to be best that you have that removed now for your secondary concern of your rheumatoid arthritis. I want you to continue to follow up with your rheumatologist and continue your medication therapy as has been previously outlined for you. Now do you have any questions, comments or concerns before before we get the paperwork signed to start the treatment process?
[patient]  No, I don't think so. I think I'll be okay. I'm scared.
[doctor]  I know you're scared, but we'll be right here with you the whole way.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Alright, we'll get some paperwork and I'll see you again in a few minutes.
[patient]  Okay, thank you.","ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Right upper lobe lung nodule.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient has incidentally found right upper lobe lung nodule visible on his chest CT. It could be a benign nodule, but because of his smoking history, I think it is best that he has it surgically removed.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I had a thorough discussion with the patient concerning surgical treatment. Surgery will require general anesthesia and will take approximately 1.5 hours. I explained to the patient that his procedure will consist of 3 small incisions being made on the side of his right chest. I will then insert a camera and scope to assist in removing the nodule along with a very small portion of his lung. He was advised that he will be admitted for most likely an overnight stay. He will have a chest tube in until the following day when I remove it at his bedside. All questions were answered.
- Medical Treatment: Pulmonary function test ordered today to obtain patient's baseline. PET CT will also be scheduled to determine if the nodule is metabolically active, which can suggest if it is cancerous or inflammatory. Nodule will be removed via video assisted thoracoscopy.

2. Rheumatoid arthritis.
- Medical Reasoning: Stable.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged the patient to continue to follow up with his rheumatologist.
- Medical Treatment: Continue medication therapy and routine follow up with rheumatologist as previously outlined.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

"[doctor]  So Tyler is a 56-year-old male who presents today complaining of difficulty swallowing and has a past medical history of diabetes and high blood pressure. So Tyler tell me what's going on with your swallowing problem.
[patient]  Well, it's just been something that I have noticed over the last, you know, for the five weeks, it seems like something is always stuck in my throat. And, you know, just I kind of go about my day and it kind of bothers me. You know, a little bit sometimes a little painful. And when I try to eat, it just seems like I have to, I don't know when it's something solid. I kind of have to wash it down on occasion. I've never really fully choked, but I have to admit that I've thought about potentially choking.
[doctor]  Okay, and is it seem to be stuck in your throat or does it seem to go in your lungs area or are you coughing with this at all or just mostly when you're swallowing?
[patient]  No coughing, just kind of when I swallow, it's all okay with liquids. But when I kind of swallow, you know, like a bite of sandwich, sometimes it just feels like, like, I just need a little help pushing it down.
[doctor]  Okay, and is it more kind of like heart like steaks or heart like larger solid like things that are that you have to chew more or is it even soft stuff like you know to eat yogurt and stuff like that?
[patient]  I'm not 100% sure, but I think it's probably more with solids.
[doctor]  Okay, how about have you noticed anything different with when you're swallowing cold or or or hot liquids? Is there is there a temperature change any modification to that?
[patient]  It's really just about solids.
[doctor]  Okay, all right, so have you noticed any blood in any place or blood in your stools or are you vomiting anything up at all?
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Okay, that's so no vomiting blood, no coughing up blood, or anything like that any weight loss or changes in your weight at all.
[patient]  Not that I want.
[doctor]  Okay, yeah, I mean, I think we all like to lose a little bit of weight, but yeah, it says it's a struggle. So no, no chest pain or shortness of breath with this.
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Okay, so I am going to talk about that in a second. I'll look at your throat as well and see what we need to do. But it sounds like we may have to send you to a specialist to take a look at that and see if there is something causing this. How about how are you doing with your diabetes? By the way, since I haven't seen you in a while, I know we have you on met form in 500 milligrams twice a day. We checked your hemoglobin A1c last time. Was seven. For we talked about improving your diet and exercise how are things going.
[patient]  I think they're going great. I mean, I'm taking my meds, I'm sticking to them, and I feel pretty good otherwise.
[doctor]  Okay, are you checking your blood sugars in the morning or are you checking those at all?
[patient]  Yeah, I don't mean once in a while I'm in a hurry and I skip it, but I have to say I probably do so about 80% of the time.
[doctor]  and how are the numbers looking?
[patient]  They're looking you know okay, they are all within you know the range that we are targeting.
[doctor]  Okay, all right. And any any no nausea vomiting or diarrhea or any other side effects from the metformin or anything like that.
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Okay, good. So I think we should probably repeat your hemoglobin A1C. It sounds like you've you know you've improved your diet and it sounds like you've you're following the regimen. So maybe the numbers will be better this time and we don't have to change your medication. So that will be awesome. How are you doing with your blood pressure? I know we have you on norvask. We ask that you check it like you know once a week or more than that if you have time blood pressure looks good today in the office. It's about 150. I'm sorry 120 over 50 right now so no nothing here in the office. Hard things at home.
[patient]  I get to now every once in a while you know the lower numbers a little bit you know higher, but it's not you know usually it's either close or on-range.
[doctor]  Okay, all right, good. So let me examine you now. So Tyler, I'm examining you now. I'm going to just verbalize some of my findings. Your neck is fine. I don't see any swelling in your neck. Your thyroid feels normal. I don't feel any masses in your neck. There's no lymph nodes. I'm looking at your throat. And that looks okay. There is no masses or any swelling that I can see. There is no redness. Yeah, there is no carotid brute. Your lung exam is clear. Your heart exam is normal. No murmurs on your belly exam. You have some epicastric tenderness right here in the right here where I'm pressing, but I don't feel any masses or any significant swelling back. There are no normal back exam. Your extremity exam looks normal. Your neurological exam is fine. So for this difficulty swallowing, I'm concerned that you may have a narrowing in your throat that's causing this. And sometimes it can be from a structure where some narrowing of the esophagus. And sometimes I need to go in and dilate that so I'm going to go ahead and send you. Give you a referral for gastroenterology and have them do a scope and take a look down there. I'm going to recommend we put you on some prilosec. Sometimes also reflux medicine. Can if you have reflux, sometimes that can also exacerbate this sometimes. So I'm going to put you on some prilosec 20 milligrams. Once a day again, I'm going to recommend that you chew your foods frequently and make sure you have it, you know, especially if you're eating something hard like steak or meat chew them really well. So they don't get tend to get stuck. Some people have sometimes things get stuck and they don't go down. And if that happens as an emergency, you do have to go to the emergency department. But seems like you know things are going down. They just seem to sometimes slow down or get stuck temporarily. So why don't I get you a referral for GI? We will start you on the prilosec. And then we will have you know if you know if you have any other symptoms or worsening's give my office a call. We will get you in or get you referred to the ER if needed any questions about that.
[patient]  No, that sounds great.
[doctor]  Okay, and for the diabetes, I'm going to order another hemoglobin. A1C, I'm going to order some more blood work today. We'll check a kidney function. And I notice that you have not had an eye referral. So I'm going to also give you an eye referral to ophthalmology to check your eyes for your diabetic, for your for any retinopathy, continue them at foreman. I'll have you come back in about a month. And that way we'll have the results back for the blood. Test if we need to make any adjustments we can, but I want to see. You back in about a month, and I think that's it for that. Any questions about that?
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Okay, and the high blood pressure, I think you're doing great continue with the Norvask. If you have any issues, certainly call me, but otherwise there is really nothing else to add for that. Did we forget anything or do need refills for anything?
[patient]  You know, I think I'm low on the Norvask, so if you could send something to my pharmacy, that would be great.
[doctor]  Okay, sure I'll get you a refill for Norvask. We'll get that sent over to the pharmacy, okay?
[patient]  Thank you.
[doctor]  Alright, thanks. Good seeing you. Thanks for coming into them.","ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

"[doctor]  So Jerry is a 45-year-old male who came in today with an ankle injury Jerry what happened.
[patient]  Hey, Dr. Michael. Yeah. So my son, Sean, I think you're in the past. He started playing basketball and then we do multiple seasons. And so we're kind of getting ready for the next season that starts in April. And we were at the courts plan and I went up for a shot and he's far more aggressive than with me than he is with you know his peers. I guess he could say. And so he found me while I was going for a lap. And then when I came down I kind of landed awkwardly and I kind of like rolled and twisted my my ankle. So now it's it's hurting a bit like kind of on the outside. You can even see it's it's bruised up and a bit swollen.
[doctor]  Yeah
[patient]  And yeah, I've been having trouble walking and it just doesn't feel solid, really stable, which is a problem I recently got back into working out and I had been in a really good rhythm going to the gym.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  And I wanted to shrub that moment on because it took a lot for me to get back to a good place so.
[doctor]  Absolutely okay, totally understand that glad to hear that you're back out on the court playing with your son. How is he doing by the way?
[patient]  He is doing great, he is doing great. I mean, you know, he is a big step-kai fan. So he likes to keep up shots from from way out past the three-point line. And he is only 10 and tiny, so it's not a good idea for him to do that. But he is doing really well. And I'm just happy he's tried every sport and basketball is really what took. So I'm just really happy that he has a sport and loves and couple of his buddies plan to lead with him. So it's just makes me happy that he's found something he really enjoys.
[doctor]  Good, good to hear. Well, let's take a look at that ankle. It looks like it's pretty swollen. So let me just do a quick exam on that right now. Alright, so it looks like the outside of your ankle. If I push on that, does that hurt pretty bad?
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  Okay, so exquisite tenderness, tenderness laterally. And then if I push here, does that hurt too?
[patient]  Yeah, a little bit.
[doctor]  Okay, so some tenderness over the medial deltoid region. So swelling on the lateral side of the ankle, no epidermalysis skin, is intact looks like you have brisk capillary refill, no horrible malalignment. So, all right, can you stand on it? Did you say that you're having trouble walking at all?
[patient]  Yeah, I mean I can stand on it and I can't walk on it. It just it hurts and it feels like I'm going to possibly injure more Just because it doesn't feel particularly solid
[doctor]  Sure, so it doesn't quite feel stable.
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  Okay, okay, I gotcha. So I know you had an X-ray as you came in today. And so I'm just looking at this X-ray here. I'll show you on the screen right here. I can turn my monitor towards you. This is an AP lateral oblique. And this is your right ankle. So what we're looking at is a displaced lateral mulealis at the Weber C level. There's no evidence of medial or posterior muleal or fractures. But this is a fracture on the lateral side of your ankle now based on the position. It's a bit unstable. That's why you're feeling some of that that instability. When you're walking so for your diagnosis, what I'm going to put down is a lateral muleal or fracture. And what I would recommend for that since it is in the location that it is, is you're probably unfortunately going to need surgery. We're going to want to get that healed, what that includes is putting some plate and some screws in. And you're going to be out for a little bit. So I know you've been trying to work out and you want to get back on the court. But you may have to have to sit out for a little bit. We'll get you some crutches.
[patient]  How long it's a little bit, because I'm also, I forgot to say I'm also, I did volunteer to coach.
[doctor]  Great!
[patient]  starting in April so.
[doctor]  Alright, well.
[patient]  How long?
[doctor]  Yeah, you're probably going to be out for about three months, but continue the coaching go ahead. And then let's get you back out there. We'll get you some crutches. And then hopefully you can kind of get back on the court, start coaching. And then within that three months, we'll get you back out doing some exercise again.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Alright, in the meantime, I'm going to prescribe some medication for now. Let's try Meloxicam and try to get some of the swelling down I want you to ice it and also keep that that ankle elevated. Do you have a job where you can elevate your ankle regularly?
[patient]  Yeah, I work from home so that that shouldn't be a problem. It's just everything else I don't know who's going to walk my dogs and do all this stuff that's rest of my family refuses to walk my dog. So we'll figure it out.
[doctor]  Yeah, I am a dog walker as well. So all right. Sorry for the bad news, but let's get you healed up so that we can get you back out doing everything you need to do.
[patient]  Alright, thank you, doctor.
[doctor]  Alright, thanks.","ASSESSMENT

Right lateral malleolar fracture.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with him regarding treatment options. Recommendation was made for an open reduction internal fixation of the right ankle. We discussed the risks and benefits of the procedure as well as the postoperative recovery period following surgery. I advised that it will be 3 months before he can resume his exercise routine. In the meantime, I will prescribe meloxicam to reduce swelling. I recommended he ice and elevate the ankle as well. He will be given crutches to assist with ambulation.

"[patient]  Miss Edwards is here for evaluation of facial pain. This is a 54 year old male.
[doctor]  How are you doing Dr. Cruz nice to see you today?
[patient]  Good to see you, Mr. Edwards, I'm Doctor.
[doctor]  Tell me what's been going on yet, so I've got the stabbing shooting pain I've had for a while you know and it had especially right here in my right face right in that cheekbone area. It's sometimes it gets super hot I've had it for I think a couple of months now and I went to my family doctor and they said I should come see you.
[patient]  Okay, great. I would like to ask you a little bit more about that.
[doctor]  How in your face do you remember how long that you had it probably for about two or three months just just came on slowly? I started noticing it, but now it's I have episodes where just shooting stabbing kind of a pain in my right cheekbone right face area.
[patient]  Emimhm, do you have any sensory loss meaning like numbness or tingling in that part of your face?
[doctor]  Not that I've noticed. No, okay. Do you have any symptoms like this anywhere else on your face, including the other side of your face?
[patient]  No, it's just on the right side, mostly not on the left side, just on the right side of my face.
[doctor]  Have you noticed any weakness on that side of the face like when you smile? Or, while you're doing other things any weakness, they're not really. I mean, I've tried to know when I smile, my smile seems equal on both sides. My eyes, I don't have any weakness. Their my vision seems to be unchanged. But just the stabbing severe pain, it's just like excruciating pain that I get sometimes does it happen on its own. Or there are certain things that trigger it.
[patient]  Sometimes if I'm of certain temperatures seem to trigger it sometimes or if it's super where it's cold I get triggered sometimes.
[doctor]  Sometimes certain kind of sensory outside of the wind, sometimes that seems to trigger it, but that's about it.
[patient]  Okay, and anything that you've done to that helps for a little bit when you.
[doctor]  Pain Excess.
[patient]  You know, I've tried ibuprofen and motrin that had really hasn't helped it just comes on suddenly and then it's kind of stabbing, excruciating pain. I've tried rubbing some, you know, some tiger balm on it that didn't work.
[doctor]  But that's, you know, so I went to my family doctor and he said, you know, I really need to see a neurosurgeon.
[patient]  Gotta how long do these episodes last these pain.
[doctor]  You know it can last for anywhere from a few minutes to sometimes about an hour, but generally, generally a few minutes.
[patient]  Any history of something like multiple sclerosis or any brain tumors that you know?
[doctor]  No nothing like that. I'll write any other kind of headache symptoms that have anything like you had migraines or anything related to the headaches. I mean, I get occasional headaches, but not really I don't have a history of migraines, but I occasionally get headaches like everybody else. I take some Tylenol that usually goes away, but this is different.
[patient]  How severe is the pain on a scale of 1 to 10?
[doctor]  When it comes on, it's like a 10, it's like somebody is stabbing you with an ice pick, and but usually you know after a few minutes, usually it goes away. But sometimes it can last up to an hour great. So, Mr. I would like to do a physical exam if that's okay with you.
[patient]  Sure.
[doctor]  I would like you to follow my finger here and I see that you're following my finger in in both directions. Can you show me your teeth?
[patient]  That looks nice and symmetric. I'm going to rub my fingers next to your ear. Can you hear that?
[doctor]  Yep.
[patient]  You can hear it on the other side as well.
[doctor]  Yep.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  I'm going to take this cotton tape and run it along the side of your face. Can you feel that okay?
[patient]  It's a little bit numb on my right side, not so much on my left side.
[doctor]  Okay, alright, I'm going to use this little needle here and I'm going to poke here and I want to see if you feel like it's being sharp or dull on that part of your face. Does that feel different or normal?
[patient]  It feels a little bit dull on my left, on my right side, my left side. It feels sharp.
[doctor]  Alright good, well I had a chance to look at your MRI.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  And I look to your MRI and it appears to have small blood vessel that is a budding and perhaps even pinching the trigeminal nerve, the trigeminal nerve is nerve that comes from the brain stem that goes out to the face and provides the sensory inflammation from the face. And you may have a condition called trigeminal neuralgia.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  where the nerve compression causes this kind of shooting electrical pain. In the face, how do we treat it?
[patient]  While the first line would be to try some medications, usually we start with medications that are called GABA PINN.
[doctor]  or tegritol these are medications that really help reduce the excitability of the nerve.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Most people can get the pain control with that, but there are some people where the medications aren't going to be enough, and in that situation we would consider surgery, I wouldn't I wouldn't recommend that now we usually try the medications first.
[patient]  for considering a surgery to decompress the nerve the root cause of the problem is the compression of the blood vessel against the nerve.
[doctor]  Okay, so we should be tried which one would you recommend the tegritol? Or yeah, I think we could start with the tegritol. To start with, I just want to make sure that you understand some of the potential side effects that you can have with this.
[patient]  Sure.
[doctor]  It's always a little bit of trial and error to figure out what the right dosing that would work for you. But some common side effects can include, you know, memory loss tingling and balance. Some people can actually have, like, dermatologic.
[patient]  skin reaction to this medication and particularly people who have you staking descent so that we may do some genetic testing just to make sure that it will be safe for you.
[doctor]  Okay, sounds good. Let's do it.
[patient]  Okay, so I will prescribe that for you, and then we will see how that goes. And if your pain continues, we can talk about different surgical options to treat the pain.
[doctor]  Yeah, I think I would like to try the Tegritall first, and if that doesn't work then I can come back. And so, one should I come back, and just to kind of check back with you, and see if you know if it's had enough time for a fact or not.
[patient]  I think one month would be a great time to follow up.
[doctor]  Okay, sounds good. So if you want to send that prescription over my pharmacy, that would be fine. And then why don't I come back in about a month and we'll go from there?
[patient]  Great, I'll see you then.
[doctor]  Alright.","ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Trigeminal neuralgia.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient has been experiencing facial pain for 2 to 3 months. A recent MRI revealed a small blood vessel abutting, or perhaps even pinching, the right trigeminal nerve. The root cause of his facial pain is the compression of the blood vessel against this nerve.
- Patient Education and Counseling: The patient and I discussed treatment options including medicating with gabapentin or Tegretol. I explained the common side effects associated with these medications can include memory loss, tingling, and imbalance. We discussed the need for genetic testing due to the possible side effect of dermatologic reactions in people of East Asian descent. We also briefly discussed surgical treatment to decompress the nerve, but this is not recommended at this time.
- Medical Treatment: A prescription for Tegretol will be sent to the patient’s pharmacy.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

The patient will follow up with me in 1 month. If at that time his facial pain persists, we may further discuss surgical options.",test1
"[doctor]  Hi Michelle, what's been going on the medical assistant told me that you injured your knee?
[patient]  Yeah, I'm gonna have to keep this my favorite story is that I had a Sandra who injured her knee cold dancing. So that would immediately came up to mine. But let's try skiing. So I was skiing in Vermont last weekend and I caught my ski when I was coming off the lift and I fell on my knee popped and it's heard ever since.
[doctor]  Okay, and were you able to ski down the hill or did you have to be taken down by the ski patrol?
[patient]  I had to be taken down by the ski patrol. I was unable to bear weight.
[doctor]  Okay, isn't that slightly terrifying? They had to do the same thing for me. And you're just kind of sitting there watching all of the trees go by. So anyway, so what part of your knee is bothering you the most? Is it the inside, the outside?
[patient]  It hurts on the outside, but it also feels like it won't hold my weight.
[doctor]  Okay, so it feels like it's gonna buckle.
[patient]  orbegar
[doctor]  Okay, alright, and are you able to bend it?
[patient]  I was immediately after the injury, but not really now.
[doctor]  Okay, and how about straightening? It are you able to straighten it at all?
[patient]  somewhat, but it really hurts when I try to straighten all the way.
[doctor]  Okay, all right now do you have any numbing or tingling in your toes?
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Okay, and can you feel your toes okay?
[patient]  I think so.
[doctor]  Okay, all right now. Are you a pretty active person you said you were skiing? Do you do what kind of other activities do you do?
[patient]  I chased my two four year old.
[doctor]  Okay, do you have twins?
[patient]  I do.
[doctor]  Nice, that's great.
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  So, okay. And what's your support like at home who is who is able to help out are you still doing that kind of hobbling around on crutches or...
[patient]  And now my husband is home with me, but he also works a job where he's gone quite a bit. So it's just me and the kids.
[doctor]  Okay, all right, and did the ski patrol give you crutches? I see you have them here with you, okay? All right, great. And are you otherwise generally healthy?
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  Okay, and no high blood pressure diabetes, anything like that.
[patient]  MM
[doctor]  No, okay, all right. And while I want to go ahead, let me just do a quick physical exam. I'm going to be calling out some of my exam findings. And I'll let you know what that means when I'm done, okay? All right, so on your hard exam, your heart sounds in a nice regular rate. And rhythm, I don't appreciate any murmur on your lung exam, your lungs are nice and clear to osculation. And remind me what need to do in jur again.
[patient]  My right knee.
[doctor]  Your right knee okay, so on your right knee examination I do appreciate some edema and an effusion over the right knee does it hurt when I press.
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  Okay, there is pain to palpation of the right lateral knee, there is decreased flexion, and extension there is a positive lockman sign, there is a palpable palpable dorsalus pedus, and posterior tibial pulse, there is no legadema in the ankle okay. Well, let's just talk a little bit about you know my assessment, and you know my plan for you. So you know I know that you had the x-ray done of your of your right knee that didn't show any bony. Abnormality, but I am concerned that you have ruptured your ear. ACL, or your anterior cruciate ligament that's like a major ligament that helps connect and helps your knee move back and forth. So I want to go ahead and order a knee MRI just so that we can get a a good look and just you know confirm that physical exam. Okay, now some people can have a normal physical exam, and their ACL can still be torn, but you do have a lot of pain on the lateral aspect of your knee, so I want to make sure if they're make sure that there is not any other structures that have been damaged by this accident. Okay, I want to go ahead and you know are you what are you taking for the pain?
[patient]  I be profan.
[doctor]  Is that helping?
[patient]  somewhat yes
[doctor]  Okay, alright, do you want something stronger?
[patient]  No, I'm okay.
[doctor]  All right, so let's just continue with ibuprofen. You can take, you know, 600 to 800 milligrams every eight hours as needed. I want to go ahead and put you in a brace that's going to help your knee feel a bit more supported. Okay. And let's go ahead. And I'm hoping that we can get this MRI done and you know the next couple days. And then we can have a conversation about what needs to be done now. You said that you are, you know, obviously a very active, active mom, any other exercise or anything else that that I should be aware of that you do just wondering in terms of which kind of graft we would use to fix this with your ACL being injured.
[patient]  No, I'm not sure I would like to get back to the running, but currently not that active.
[doctor]  Okay, alright, alright. Do you have any questions about anything?
[patient]  I think you've explained it well.
[doctor]  Okay, alright, so I'll see you again soon, okay.
[patient]  Okay, thank you.
[doctor]  Alright take care bye.","ASSESSMENT

Right knee pain, possible ACL tear.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to her current symptoms. I have recommended that we obtain an MRI of the right knee to evaluate for a possible ACL tear. In the meantime, I have advised her to continue taking ibuprofen 600 to 800 mg every 8 hours as needed for pain. She will also be placed into a brace for increased knee support.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me once the MRI results are available for review and further discussion.",test1
"[doctor]  Hey Brandon, you know glad to see you in here today. I see on your chart that you're experiencing some neck pain could you tell me a bit about what happened.
[patient]  Yeah, I was in a car crash.

[doctor]  Okay, so multiple car crashes all right, so let's see if we can how many let's start.

[patient]  while the ones that are my fault were all of them.

[doctor]  Okay, the most recent crash, when was that?
[patient]  That's when I was coming home from the pain clinic because my neck hurt and my back hurt, but that was in February.
[doctor]  Okay, alright, so we had a car crash in February.
[patient]  What year? It was which February it was.
[doctor]  Okay, so let's try with this one. See what happens. Hopefully you remember I need you to start writing down these car crashes that this is becoming a thing, but you know it's okay. So let's say maybe you had a...
[patient]  You're not judging me are you?
[doctor]  No, there's no judgment here whatsoever. I want to make sure that I'm giving you the best advice possible. And in order to do that, I need the most information that you can provide me make sense.
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  Alright, so we're going to say hope maybe that you had a car crash and we can verify this in February of this year. And you've been experiencing some neck pain since then, right?
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  Okay, all right on a scale of 1 to 10, what 10 is your arm as being cut off by a chainsaw severe how bad is your pain.
[patient]  12
[doctor]  Okay, terrible pain. Now I know you mentioned you had previous car crashes and you've been to therapy, has anyone prescribed you any medication? It's you said you went to pain clinic, yes.
[patient]  Well, they had prescribed it recently. I was on Fennel.
[doctor]  Oh
[patient]  I haven't gone to prescription for several weeks.
[doctor]  Okay, all right. And so we will be able to check on that when you take your medication. So before you take your medication, rather like are you able to move like are you experiencing any stiffness?
[patient]  Yes, but it hurts.
[doctor]  Okay, it hurts what kind of pain is it sharp as a dull? Is it throbbing?
[patient]  It's the sharp incapacitating pain I can't work.
[doctor]  Wow, okay are you having any headaches?
[patient]  Of course.
[doctor]  Any Disney-ness.
[patient]  Just sometimes.
[doctor]  Any visual disturbances is it hard to like are you?
[patient]  not recently known.
[doctor]  Okay, alright, any numbness.
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  Where?
[patient]  My left arm and my right leg.
[doctor]  Okay, any spasms?
[patient]  Of course.
[doctor]  Okay, where?
[patient]  My body hurts, I told you my neck hurts.
[doctor]  Okay, so I know I'm absolutely I want to make sure that we are going to give you the medication that works like the best for you So I'm sorry if these questions seem like frustrating. I would just want to make sure that I understand what the problem is so
[patient]  I saw Pamela and Dr. Collins' office. She's much nicer than you know.
[doctor]  I mean, okay, so, you know, what, like, maybe, maybe Pamela would be better. Like, we could maybe talk about a referral if that would make you more comfortable.
[patient]  My lawyer told me to come here.
[doctor]  Then you're stuck with me, okay, I'm so sorry. But here it's we're gonna try and make it as good as possible, alright? So last thing, I do wanna do my physical exam, alright? And I need you to let me know as as much as you, as much as you can verbalize, right? So when I push here in the middle of your neck on top of the bone, does it hurt?
[patient]  Yes, yes.
[doctor]  Okay, alright, sorry, what about on the side? Does that hurt?
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  Okay, so pain on palpation both on the bony process and on the muscle can you move your neck from side to side? Can you move your neck? Can you swive at side to side? No, no, all right. So I'm I'm seeing I'm seeing some range of movement, moderate range of movement that's fine. Okay. I so when can you bend your neck forward that that's your whole body just just the neck are you capable of bending up?
[patient]  Really hurts, it really hurts.
[doctor]  Okay, it really hurts to bend forward and backwards. Okay, all right. So I'm just going to make a little note here. I don't I don't see any bruising. I'm not noticing any swelling there is. I I don't see any laceration what.
[patient]  to sometimes it bruises.
[doctor]  Okay, sometimes alright, that's fine. I just am not seeing one here today, so that's okay. Alright, so with that being said, I do want to ask have you been experiencing any fatigue? Are you tired?
[patient]  Well, since the accident, yes.
[doctor]  Okay, all right, just making sure okay. So this is what this is my assessment. And plan this is what we are going to do. I want to be able to like we had you do an x-ray before you came in here. And looking at it, I'm not noticing any fracture that's a really good sign considering how many car accidents we've been in lately.
[patient]  It hurts it hurts.
[doctor]  Absolutely no, I were going to address the pain so for my first so looking at your imaging results though I'm not seeing a fracture that's a great sign so for your first diagnosis I'm going to say that you have what is called a next brain that
[patient]  Thinking are you saying I'm thinking?
[doctor]  No not by any means I am saying.
[patient]  Paint I have a lot of paint.
[doctor]  Yes, and your pain can be explained by multiple things, but thankfully it's not a broken neck is that okay.
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  Alright, so what we are going to do when we are going to try and treat this as conservatively as possible.
[patient]  So it might be broken.
[doctor]  What?
[patient]  Pamela said it might be broken.
[doctor]  If Pamela said it's broken, then you know what this is what we're going to do. We're going to order something called a CT that's going to give us even no, you know what, let's upgrade to an MRI. It's going to give us the most thorough image of everything that's going on the heart. And the soft tissues is that going to, is that so that way we can really get a good image of what's happening inside, right?
[patient]  Okay, because what the lawyers said I needed was an MRI.
[doctor]  Not a problem where we're going to make your lawyer happy next step. We are going to try working like from the outside. And so I do need you to work on getting like you're saying you've seen some bruising and some swelling yourself. So I want you to put ice on that whenever you're experiencing that in the moment when you wake up, I want you to do your best to just like I'm going to give you some exercises on the sheet. And I want you to roll through these exercises every morning right to just get some like movement and like free for no-save movement back into your neck. I also want to put you on a couple of medications. Now I know that you said you were on fentanyl before that's a bit extreme. And I want to like monitor this a little more conservatively. So we're going to start with this something called row backsen.
[patient]  It hurts a lot if I don't get more fininal.
[doctor]  You know, we can refer you to pain medicine if it really is getting that complicated, but for this current period, we're going to put you on some rowbacks and it's going to be 1,500 milligrams. And you're going to take that six to eight hours, every six to eight hours, and that really should help kind of relax the muscles in the area, take off some of that tension, and really help with that pain if you're noticing that the rowbacks and still isn't helping. Maybe then we can start using like a heat pad, or maybe some icy hot the bio-freeze is a really good one to kind of help with that. And then we will refer you to physical therapy. I think with the MRI, we can start evaluating maybe some additional steps. So rather than you having to like take that fentanyl, because I don't want you to be in danger, right, like people I don't want you to get rubbed. So what we could explore are local injections, right, and we can refer you to pain, medication, and see about like locally injecting the area, and that should be able to help you out hopefully with this.
[patient]  I can't go to work like this.
[doctor]  Okay, so if it's if it's that bad, let's wait for the MRI result, we're going to give you off for work because you know you can't move and we'll see what the MRI says about what weather or not we can get you like true local injections in the moment is that all right for now.
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  Okay, okay, any other questions?
[patient]  Not right now.
[doctor]  Alright.","ASSESSMENT

Neck sprain.

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. I have explained to him that his x-rays did not reveal any signs of a fracture. I recommended an MRI for further evaluation. I have also prescribed the patient Robaxin 1500 mg every 6 to 8 hours to treat his pain. I have also advised him to utilize ice, a heating pad, IcyHot, or Biofreeze on his neck as needed. I have also provided him with a home exercise program to work on his range of motion. I advised the patient that he will not be able to work until we have the MRI results.
