virtassist,D2N128,"[doctor]  Hi, Carolyn. How are you?
[patient]  Good. How are you?
[doctor]  I'm good. You're ready to get started?
[patient]  Yes, I am.
[doctor]  So, Carolyn is a 49-year-old female here for follow-up of her chronic problems. So, how are you doing, Carolyn?
[patient]  I'm doing okay. My osteoarthritis has been flaring up a little bit lately. So I want to get talk about that primarily. So it's mostly in my elbows and it's really been bothering me. I've been sitting at the computer at the desk more in the office. So I don't know if it's being stagnant in that position all day has increased flare-up for that. But I want to talk to you about that.
[doctor]  Okay, sure. And are you right or left-handed?
[patient]  I'm right-handed.
[doctor]  Okay, and does one elbow bother you more than the other?
[patient]  My right elbow does bother me more than the other, but primarily, I'm typing all day versus writing, so it... ...it flares up in both.
[doctor]  Okay, all right, and any other joint pain?
[patient]  No, just really focused on my elbows.
[doctor]  Okay, and any numbing or tingling in your hands.
[patient]  Sometimes when I'm typing for long periods of time, I feel a little bit of numbing. I try to shake out my arms a little bit. Just to kind of relieve that sensation.
[doctor]  Okay, alright, and I know that you've had this also had this history of gout. And the last episode you had was about three months ago. You had some inflammation of your toe. Have you had any other issues with that?
[patient]  No, I haven't. The medication you gave me really controlled it and I haven't seen a flare-up sense.
[doctor]  Okay. Alright, and how are you doing with your psoriasis?
[patient]  That's been under control too. That hasn't been a major problem for me either.
[doctor]  Okay, I know that we had given you some club edisol for your scalp. Is that so that's doing okay?
[patient]  Yeah, that's doing a lot better.
[doctor]  Okay, great. Um, all right. Well, I'd like to go ahead and do a physical exam on you.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Let's first look at your vital signs. Hey, dragon, show me the vital signs. Great. So everything looks good from that perspective. So looking at you, I don't appreciate any cervical lymphedenopathy. Your heart is a nice regular rate and rhythm, and your lungs sound really clear. On your right elbow, you do have some edema and inflammation of your right electron on, and there's some tenderness and an effusion right there. So does that hurt when I press it?
[patient]  Yeah, that does hurt.
[doctor]  Okay and when I turn your arm, do you have pain?
[patient]  Yeah, that hurts a bit too.
[doctor]  Okay, so she is pain to palpation of the electron on Bertha and pain with pre-nation and supination. And when you flex and when you bend it and straighten it, does that hurt?
[patient]  Yeah, it doesn't a bit stiff too.
[doctor]  Okay, so pain with flexion and extension of the right arm. Uh, your abdomen is nice and soft and there's no lower extremity edema. Uh, let's go ahead and take a look at some of your labs. You know, you have a lot of arthritis for someone so young, so we had sent off that autoimmune panel. Hey, Dragon. Show me the autoimmune labs. Hey, Dragon. Show me the autoimmune profile. Hey, Dragon. Show me the ESR. Okay, so that's good. Hey, Dragon. Show me the uric acid. Okay. All right. Well, good. That's great. So, you know, it doesn't look like you have any systemic arthritis or cysts, systemic inflammatory and process going on. So my impression of you at this time is that from a gout standpoint, everything is nice and stable. I think that we should continue you on the Cultusine 0.6 milligrams twice a day as needed for flare ups of your gout. Um, and then for osteoarthritis, I'd like to go ahead and order a right elbow X-ray. Hey, Dragon. Order a right elbow X-ray. And then I'd like to prescribe some Meloxicam 15 milligrams once a day for the pain and the swelling.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Hey, Dragon. Order Miloxicam 15 milligrams once a day. And then I'd like to just see those how the X-ray show shows up and the results of that before we refer you for any type of physical therapy, okay?
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  And then from a psoriasis standpoint, I think everything is stable. We'll continue you on the steroid cream for your scalp, okay?
[patient]  That sounds good.
[doctor]  Alright, do you have any questions?
[patient]  No, that's it.
[doctor]  Alright, take care.
[patient]  Thank you.

virtassist,D2N129,"[doctor]  Good afternoon, Beverly. Good to see you.
[patient]  Nice to see you too.
[doctor]  So I know my nurse told you a little bit about DAX. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to tell DAX a little bit about you.
[patient]  Go for it.
[doctor]  Great. Beverly is a 24-year-old female patient, and I know you have a history of type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure. Correct?
[patient]  Yep.
[doctor]  Okay, so you're here today for your yearly exam. Haven't seen you in a year. How are you doing?
[patient]  I've been doing well. I began working in a bakery this summer, which has been super fun. I have really been enjoying working there, but I find myself since I'm so close to so many delicious treats, snacking a lot during shifts and eating a lot more desserts than I normally would.
[doctor]  Okay, so that brings me to your diabetes. So, how have your blood sugar spin?
[patient]  Not so good.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  So they've been up and down because of my diet. I think because I've been taking my medication as prescribed. So I haven't missed anything there, but my diet has been pretty bad lately.
[doctor]  Pretty bad lately.
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  Okay, and that's really the only thing that's different is your diet pretty much.
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  And that's because of the new job and all that.
[patient]  Yeah, it has been really challenging to resist the temptation.
[doctor]  It's hard to ignore those desserts, aren't they?
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  No will power like me.
[patient]  No, no willpower.
[doctor]  Okay, alright. And then I know you've had high blood pressure, hypertension. How is how have your blood sugars been? Have you been checking them?
[patient]  So my blood pressure has been good, despite my diabetes levels being up and down.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  So that's been good.
[doctor]  Okay, so your blood pressures have been normal. You've been sleeping well?
[patient]  Yep, getting a full eight hours.
[doctor]  No concerns about hurting yourself or anything like that.
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Okay, good. Okay, and I know my, um, nurse did a review of systems. Other than what we've talked about so far, is there anything else that you needed to add?
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Good. So pretty much status quo, except for those things that we've been working on, right?
[patient]  Yep.
[doctor]  Okay, good. Alright. Well, let me do a quick physical exam, okay?
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Okay, squeeze my finger here. Good. Can you feel me touch out here?
[patient]  Yep.
[doctor]  Okay, and can you feel me touch you down here?
[patient]  Yep.
[doctor]  Okay, no swelling. Push your leg out. Good. Pull it back. Go. Good. Okay. So on my exam, essentially, your exam is normal. Your heart is regular. You do have that grade two systolic ejection fraction back ejection murmur that you that we've heard in the past. Okay, so we definitely know that's there. That's unchanged. Okay. Your lungs are clear. Your grips are equal. Nurovascular is intact. You don't have any carotid boots in your neck. No thyramegaly. No edema. Pulse's are good, so essentially your exam is essentially normal. Let's take a look at some of your lab work. Okay?
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Hey, Dragon, show me the hemoglobin A1c. Okay, so blood sugars have been elevated. Your hemoglobin A1c is elevated as well, so that tells me your blood sugars have been a little bit out of control. You're still taking them at formin, correct?
[patient]  Yes, I am.
[doctor]  Okay, and you take that twice a day?
[patient]  Yep.
[doctor]  Okay. Ooh, hey, dragol. Show me the vital signs. Okay. Good news here is your blood pressure is good. Everything, there's fine. So my assessment is, your first problem is diabetes. It's a little out of control. We'd like that hemoglobin A1c to be under seven, at least, preferably under six.
[patient]  MM
[doctor]  So, I'm not going to change your medication. I think this is diet related, so I want you to try to cut down on the snacking and additional sweets, okay?
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  And I want you to check your blood sugars in the morning. I want you to call them in in about two weeks, so we know what your first fasting blood sugar was in the morning. And then we'll come back and see you in about two months and see if everything has straightened out. If it hasn't, then we'll talk about adding another medication, okay?
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Your second problem is your hypertension. That seems to be relatively stable. I want you to stay on your current medication. You're only, licent-a-pril 10 milligrams once a day. Just stay right on that medication. No changes at this point. Seems to be doing well, okay?
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Good. Anything else I can do for you today?
[patient]  No, that's it.
[doctor]  Good, come with me, we'll get you checked out.

[patient]  So I've always struggled with high blood pressure, but it's seeming to get really out of control lately. So I want to come in and see if there's any type of new medication I can be on, help it get steady, or if there's diet restrictions I should take, things like that.
[doctor]  Okay, so I know that we've had you on the Norvask and we had to increase your dose, so you're on 10 milligrams a day now. And what are your blood pressures running at home? You see, like, have they been like over 150?

[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Hey, Dragon, show me the blood pressure. Yeah, and you're right it.
[patient]  HM
[doctor]  It is high. So there is something that we can do for that. So let's go ahead and we'll put you on. So my impression of you is that your blood pressure is high and the norvask isn't controlling it. And you know, we can definitely get it under better control. So what I would like to do is prescribe you CoreG 25 milligrams twice a day. And that will help bring your blood pressure down, okay?
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Hey, Dragon, order Carva Dylal 25 milligrams twice a day. I'd also like to go ahead and get a lipid panel and some routine labs on you just to make sure that everything is okay.
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  Hey, dragon, order a lipid panel. Hey, dragon, order a complete metabolic panel. All right. And then from a transplant standpoint, everything looks fine. Your kidney function looks great, so we're just going to continue you on all of those medications. So the nurse will come in soon and she'll help you schedule all of the owl. Schedule a follow-up appointment with me, and we'll see where your blood pressure looks like in a couple weeks after taking that medication. Okay?

[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  Hey dragon, I'm seeing Mrs. Lee today for a back pain. She's a 40 year old female. So can you tell me what happened to you?
[patient]  Yes, I was at a birthday party and it was surprise party. So we were all like crunch behind and hiding. And when the person came and we all jumped out and then I fell down the little stair and I ran my back into the railing of the S staircase.
[doctor]  So, it was a surprise for you too.
[patient]  Yes it was.
[doctor]  Very good. Okay, so did it hurt because you hit it or did you twist? What happened when you?
[patient]  I think it was my motion.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  of jumping up or something.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  and maybe a twisting.
[doctor]  Okay. Any pain shooting down your legs at all?
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Is it on one side or the other of your back?
[patient]  um... it's more on the right
[doctor]  On the right, is there anything that makes it better or worse?
[patient]  If I'm lying flat, it hurts a little more, and any twisting motion for sure.
[doctor]  Okay. Alright. And do you have any history or any back problems before?
[patient]  I did. I had a fusion done.
[doctor]  Okay, yeah that lumber fusion. Um, let's take an x-ray. Hey. Or let's look at an x-ray. Hey dragon, show me the latest x-ray. Okay, we can see where you had your fusion. T4 here on the x-ray. But I don't see anything that looks, um, significantly abnormal. It doesn't appear to have any compression fractures or anything like that. So it's essentially except for the fusion and normal exam. Let me do your exam for you here. Can I have you stand up please? Does it hurt when I twist you that way?
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  Okay, you can sit back down. If I lift your leg here, does not bother you?
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  How about when I lift this leg?
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Any pain shooting down your legs when I do that?
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Okay, and can you feel me touching down here?
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  Okay, great. So you had to injure it to your back when you were twisting at the birthday party. You don't really have any pain or numbness down your legs. You have some stiffness with rotation, but you don't have any evidence of what we would call a pinch-nerved or radiculopathy. So I think you basically have a strain of your lower back. Have you been taking any medications?
[patient]  Just some ibuprofen.
[doctor]  Okay, and do you have any other medical problems?
[patient]  I might take medication for anxiety.
[doctor]  Okay, and that's all. Okay. So what we're going to do is I'm going to give you, just continue the motrin at 800 milligrams three times a day with food. I want you to use some ice and heat alternating on your back. But I do want you walking.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  um... and uh... this should sort of take care of itself after a few days if it's not or it's getting worse i want you to come back and see me over the next week
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Does that sound good?
[patient]  It does.
[doctor]  Okay, dragon. Hey dragon, go ahead and order the medications and procedures and close out the note. Come on, I'll bring you out to check out.
[patient]  Thank you.","CC:

virtassist,D2N133,"[doctor]  Good morning, Rebecca. Nice to see you.
[patient]  Nice to see you too.
[doctor]  So, my nurse told you a little bit about DAX. Now I'm wondering if I can tell DAX a little bit about you.
[patient]  Go for it.
[doctor]  Okay, so Rebecca is a 27 year old female patient. You have a history of carpal tunnel. A release done a couple of years ago, you have some chronic back pain, some depression. Why am I seeing you today?
[patient]  So last week, and over the course of the month, I have taken up swimming more regularly.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  I've been trying to get up and get active. And all of a sudden I've been feeling some really bad knee pain.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  Am I right, me?
[doctor]  Justin, you're right, me.
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  Okay, just when swimming. Are you swimming freestyle with your legs kicking straight or more like breaststroke where your legs kick out?
[patient]  Yeah, it's only while swimming. I used the breaststroke, so I guess where the legs are kicking out like a frog, it kind of starts hurting a little bit after I swim a couple laps, which a month ago when I started I was able to do 10.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  But after a couple of laps, it starts to hurt.
[doctor]  and no injury, like you didn't fall or twist it or anything like that that you remember.
[patient]  No, not that I can remember.
[doctor]  Okay, so just swimming a lot and you feeling more and more discomfort?
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  Okay, good. So, um, I know my nurse did a review of systems before you came in. There were really no significant issues. You have a history of chronic back pain. That's been doing well?
[patient]  Yeah, it comes and goes, but right now it's doing really well.
[doctor]  Okay, no pain going down your legs or anything like that.
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Okay, and I know you have some depression. You've been on medication. How's that been going?
[patient]  That's been going really well.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  with the medication and therapy, and then trying to get outside more has been really helping me.
[doctor]  Sleeping well?
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  Eating well? Okay. Don't feel any concerns about hurting yourself or others or anything like that.
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Okay, good. And you had CA Carpal Tunnel Dawn a few years ago. How's that doing?
[patient]  That's doing.
[doctor]  Any flare up with that?
[patient]  That's doing really well. I've been getting full range of motion and it's felt a lot better.
[doctor]  Okay, great. Do you mind if I do a quick exam?
[patient]  Yeah, go for it.
[doctor]  Squeeze my fingers for me. Good. Okay. Is it painful if I move your patella like that?
[patient]  Yeah, that hurts.
[doctor]  Okay, and I'm gonna hold your leg out. I'm gonna hold. I want you to stiffen your upper. Does that hurt when I do that?
[patient]  Yeah, that hurts too.
[doctor]  Okay, good. Alright. Let's take a quick look at your x-ray, okay?
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Hey, dragon, show me the right knee x-ray. Okay, so here's a picture of your right knee. Actually, normal x-ray, everything looks good, okay? On my exam, you don't really have any swelling in your joints of your knee. You have a little pain with a range of motion of the knee. You have real pain when we do what we call patella in patella inhibition, okay? So that's what caused most of that pain. So your heart is regular, your lungs are clear. I don't feel any adenopathy or thyroid, normal. Your grips are equal. The rest of your exam is essentially normal, okay? So my assessment is you have what we call condromalacia of the patella, okay? It's just from the overuse and all. All the swimming you've been doing, okay? So to treat that we'll just use some anti-inflammatories, go ahead and take some ibuprofen 600 milligrams for times a day with food. I do want you to do some straight leg raising exercises. That'll strengthen your quadriceps and that'll help with that pain, okay?
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Basically, you want to avoid anything that puts extra pressure on your knees for a little while, and it should be fine. If it's not getting any better in a couple weeks, I want to see you again, okay? So no lunges avoid the breast stroke. If you're comfortable, you can also do other swimming strokes where your knees are straight instead, or you can take the opportunity to have a little break.
[patient]  All right.
[doctor]  Your second problem is your chronic back pain. That's been doing really well. Keep swimming. That's okay after this gets better.
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  But I think that's been under control. But if it flares up go ahead and give me a call, okay?
[patient]  MM
[doctor]  Your third problem is your depression. That's been stable. We're going to keep you on your current medication. Not going to change anything at this point, okay? And as far as your carpal tunnel goes, that's relatively stable. So no changes there as well, okay? So anything else I can do for you?
[patient]  No, that's it.
[doctor]  Okay, well we'll get you checked out.
[patient]  All right.
[doctor]  Hey Dragon, finalize the report.","CHIEF COMPLAINT

virtassist,D2N135,"[patient]  I have high blood sugar. Yeah, osteoarthritis, arterial fibrillation, and reflux.
[doctor]  Hi, Hannah. How are you?
[patient]  Good, how are you?
[doctor]  I'm good. You ready to get started?
[patient]  Yes, I am.
[doctor]  So Hannah is a 52 year old female here for evaluation of a high blood sugar. So Hannah, what how it happened? I heard you were in the emergency room with a high blood sugar.
[patient]  Yes, so I've been eating a ton of sweets recently. With the holidays, it just feels like there is always something sweet available. Whether I am at work and there are holiday gift baskets or clients bringing in treats or when I visit my family for the holidays and there is every baked good imaginable. There's always something sweet I can be eating. In the beginning I felt fine but I have started to feel it after a couple of weeks and this past week I just felt really lightheaded and I could was seeing spots really dizzy. So I went into the emergency room and they said I had a high blood sugar. So I wanted to come in and follow up with you to get that get checked out.
[doctor]  Okay, alright. And how are you feeling now? Did they did? Did they treat you in the emergency room? Did they GI? They give you some for fluids and things like that?
[patient]  Yeah, they gave me some fluids and they told me just to try to really cut out eating any extra sweets and get back into my normal routine and diet. But I'm still staying with my family and my mom and grandmother are big bakers. So I think it will be really hard to get into a routine there. So I just want to make sure I'm nipping this high blood sugar thing in the bud.
[doctor]  Okay, and I saw you went through a review of system sheet with a nurse. I just want to ask you a few more questions from that standpoint, so you have had any fever or chills.
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  any chest pain or shortness of breath.
[patient]  in or no.
[doctor]  abdominal pain.
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Any burning when you urinate?
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  any joint pain or muscle aches.
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  I do have osteoarthritis though, so that when I say no, it's not like nothing out of the norm.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  For me.
[doctor]  Perfect. And then I know that you have this history of a fib atrial fibrillation. Have you felt your heart racing at all recently?
[patient]  Only when I'm really anxious. I feel it pumping a little bit, but other than that I haven't.
[doctor]  Okay, alright. And how are you doing with your reflux?
[patient]  I've been doing well. I've been taking the medication that you prescribed to me and that's been helping a lot.
[doctor]  Okay yeah. I see here you're on the prognix, 40 milligrams once a day.
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  So that's, you're doing well with that.
[patient]  Yep.
[doctor]  Okay, all right. So let's go ahead and do a quick physical exam. So listening to you, look or looking at you, you appear in no distress. Your thyroid is a little enlarged, but non-tender. There's no carotid brutes. Your heart is in a regular rate and rhythm, and your lungs are clear. Your abdomen is nice and soft, and you have no edema in your lower extremities. Let's go ahead and look at some of your test results.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Hey, dragon, show me the blood sugar. Hey, dragon, show me the blood glucose. Hey, dragon, show me the hemoglobin A1c. Okay, so I see here that both your blood sugar and your hemoglobin A1c are elevated. So your blood sugars have probably been running high for probably a few months. Okay, let's go ahead and look at some of your other results. Hey, dragon, show me the diabetes labs. Yeah, okay. Yeah, so my impression of you at this time, for your high blood sugars, that you do have this diagnosis of diabetes. Now, we're not sure if it's type I or type II. Even patients in, you know, in their mid-20s can develop type I diabetes. So we're going to go off and we're going to go ahead and send some labs to work that up. Hey, dragon, order a complete metabolic panel. And I'd like to start you on that form in 500 milligrams twice a day. That will help keep your blood sugars down.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Hey, dragon, order met foreman, 500 milligrams, twice a day. And then if some of the autoimmune labs that come back show that you have an autoimmune disorder, meaning that you would have type by diabetes, then we would have to go ahead and put you on insulin. But I'm going to hold off until we have those results, okay?
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  But in the meantime, I really want you to avoid foods high in sugar. And the nurse will come in and she'll give you a glucometer and teach you how to do blood sugar testing. Okay?
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  And then from an atrial fibrillation standpoint, your heart, even though you're an atrial fibrillation right now, isn't a good rate. And we'll just continue you on your Metaprolol, 25 milligrams, twice a day. Do you need a refill on that?
[patient]  Yes, I do.
[doctor]  Hey, Dragon, order a refill on Metaprolol 25 milligrams twice a day. And for your reflux, we'll just continue you on the Prodynix, okay?
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Do you have any questions, Hannah?
[patient]  No, not at this time.
[doctor]  Okay, so the nurse will come in and she'll go over all that stuff with you.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Take care.

virtassist,D2N136,"[doctor]  Hi Janet, how are you?
[patient]  Good, how are you?
[doctor]  I'm good. Uh, are you ready to get started?
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  Okay, so Janet is a 33 year old female here for some some joint paint. What what joint's been bothering you Janet?
[patient]  It's been mostly my knees actually. I've been doing more stair type workouts, which I thought was building muscle on my knees and supposed to help.
[doctor]  NEXT
[patient]  But in turn, it really hasn't, so my knees have been really bothering me.
[doctor]  Okay, alright. And is it one knee versus the other? Or both equally?
[patient]  It's both equally.
[doctor]  Okay. And have you been having any other joint pain like elbows or shoulder or anything like that?
[patient]  No, but I should mention that like, I had a rotator cuff repair about two years ago.
[doctor]  Mhmm. No
[patient]  uh... but i haven't had any problems since that point
[doctor]  Okay, and what shoulder was that?
[patient]  That was my right shoulder.
[doctor]  Okay, all right. And any pins and needles in your feet at all? Any swelling in your legs?
[patient]  Oh no, nothing like that.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  But it would be something that I look out for often, just because I have diabetes.
[doctor]  Okay, and your blood sugars have been under control?
[patient]  Yes, they have been.
[doctor]  Okay, and have you had any fever or chills?
[patient]  No, nothing like that.
[doctor]  Okay. Any nausea or vomiting? Chest pains, shortness of breath?
[patient]  No, but I do have high blood pressure, but I monitor that and I've been taking medication for that and that hasn't elevated in any way since the joint pain.
[doctor]  Okay. Alright. So yeah, I see on here that you do take Norbask 5MG a day and you've been taking that every day.
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  Okay, and so let's go ahead and do a quick physical exam on you. So, hey dragon, show me the blood pressure. Your blood pressure is actually pretty high today, so you might be a little nervous here, which is not uncommon.
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  So, looking at you, your neck is nice and soft. There's no enlarged thyroid. Your heart has a regular rate and rhythm. Your lungs are clear. Your abdomen is nice and soft. But looking at your knees, on your left knee, you do have a slight arithema and edema. There is a small effusion present over your left knee. You have some decrease flexion and extension of your knee, but your strength in your lower extremities is good. So, let's go ahead and look at some of your results. I know that we did some x-rays when you came in.
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  Hey dragon, show me the left knee x-ray. Okay, so looking at this, this is and this is a normal x-ray of your left knee, so you may just have a little bit of a strain going on in your knees there.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Let's look at some of your labs, because I know that you have the diabetes. Hey, Dragon, show me the labs. So, here, white blood cell count is not elevated. So, I'm not concerned about an infection or anything like that. Hey, Dragon, show me the diabetes labs. Okay, and your A1C is a little elevated, but it's not terrible. So, I think for right now, we'll just continue you on the current regimen. So, my plan for you, in terms of the joint pain, I'd like to go ahead and we'll just send some autoimmune labs to work up your left knee pain. And we'll work for you to do some physical therapy. And I'd like to go ahead and give you anti-inflammatory medication to help with the pain. Does that sound okay?
[patient]  That sound great.
[doctor]  Okay. Hey, dragon, order, maloxicam 15 milligrams once a day. Hey, dragon, order a physical therapy referral. Hey, dragon, order an autoimmune profile. And then from a hypertension standpoint, you, because your blood pressure is a little elevated today, I'd like you to continue to monitor it at home. And you know, send me a report in the next couple of weeks, S.H. You know, giving me the blood pressure reporting. Do you have a blood pressure cuff at home?
[patient]  Yes, I do.
[doctor]  Okay, and then we'll go ahead and order a lipid profile for you. Hey, Dragon, order a lipid profile. And then four from a diabetes standpoint, let's go ahead and continue you on your Metform in 500 milligrams twice a day. Okay?
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Do you have any questions?
[patient]  No, that's it.
[doctor]  Okay, the nurse will be in soon. It was good to see you.
[patient]  Nice seeing you too.

Okay, so my assessment is that you do have hypertension still. And I think we need to increase your blood pressure medicine a little bit. Okay, so I'm going to increase your lysinopryl to 10 milligrams a day just once a day. But I'm going to increase that a little bit. Okay, and then why you to check it and I'm going to have you come back in a month and we'll see how you're doing with regards to that. Okay.

virtscribe,D2N138,"[doctor]  Next patient is Emily Hernandez. Date of birth, March 26, 2001. This is a 20-year-old female being seen today for our yearly follow-up for asthma, allergic rhinitis, and food allergy. Due to insurance changes since our last office appointment in April 2020, she was switched from SIMBICORT to Wixula. She also uses ZIRTECH in the spring, summer, and fall for her seasonal allergy symptoms, which tend to work well. She also has known peanut allergy. She does tolerate almonds and cashews. Please put in the asthma section at the very bottom that the ACSCOR is 21. Please put under interval history. Written consent is obtained today to use DACS for documentation.
[doctor]  Hi Emily, how are you?
[patient]  I'm pretty good, how are you?
[doctor]  I'm good. Thank you. So, gosh, we last talked a little bit over a year ago, and it was just a telemedicine visit, but it seems like you've been doing pretty good. I know there was an insurance change. I think you had switched over to Wixula. Is that right?
[patient]  Yep, that's right, and it's what I'm currently using.
[doctor]  Okay, and that's the 250 slash 50 dose, correct?
[patient]  Yes, correct.
[doctor]  Perfect. So how does that compare?
[patient]  I mean, it's working well. I really haven't had any issues with it, and I take it once in a morning and once at night.
[doctor]  And that's one puff twice a day.
[patient]  MM
[doctor]  Okay, and have you been having to use your Albuterol inhaler at all?
[patient]  Rarely and if I do it's really just before a workout or something out that if I know I'm really going to be pushing it
[doctor]  So it sounds like it's around strenuous activity.
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  Okay, so you can do things like go on a walk or go into the grocery store no problem and just use it for more exertional stuff.
[patient]  Yes, like if I'm gonna go for a run or something like that, I'll really just take it before as a preventive.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  And I've been trying to use my daily if I can a little less because I'm trying to go into the military soon.
[doctor]  No kidding, that's great.
[patient]  Yeah, so I have to be able to operate basically at a certain fitness level without an inhaler.
[doctor]  Really?
[patient]  Yeah, and if I can prove that I'm capable of these activities without an inhaler, it makes it easier.
[doctor]  And so by inhaler do they mean both your daily and rescue inhalers?
[patient]  MM, so it's like they'll have a fitness test and basically they'll tell me not to take my inhaler that day before the test and then they'll see how the asthma affects me and they're looking to see if it's serious enough to hold me back from joining or whatever. So I've been taking it less and less and really some days I feel like I don't need it.
[doctor]  And that is the wicksela that you're not taking. So on average per week, how many days of the week do you use one puff in the morning and one puff at night?
[patient]  Probably about three or four.
[doctor]  Okay, three to four days per week and the other days it's once a day?
[patient]  Yes, that's correct.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  and it's either in the morning or at night that I'm taking it.
[doctor]  Okay, and do you think that's working okay?
[patient]  I do.
[doctor]  Great! And any urgent care or visits at all for breathing over the past year.
[patient]  Nope.
[doctor]  Okay, so I'm going to assume no one has put you on prednisone for breathing issues then.
[patient]  Nope.
[doctor]  Okay, and now, military wise, what's the time frame of when you'll be completing some of these exorstional tests? Like, what are your next steps?
[patient]  So hopefully I'm going to be enlisted early spring of 2022. So that gives me about six to seven months to get to a point where I'm able to exert my body where I don't really need the inhaler. Or at least show them that I have it under control.
[doctor]  Now when you were in the other room, you completed a breathing test correct?
[patient]  Correct.
[doctor]  Okay, great. So now let me ask you about the allergies, because I know typically you'll use the Zerteck in the spring, summer and fall, correct?
[patient]  Yeah, I don't really, or I'm sorry, I use it mortar and spring and fall. I don't really have to use it too much in the summer.
[doctor]  Do you use it more just as kneaded in the summer?
[patient]  Yeah, that's right.
[doctor]  Okay, and have you been taking the Zertek every day recently since you're riding the mix of spring?
[patient]  Not every day, but I do take it on days I know I'm going to be outside a lot. I do tend to work outside about three days a week, so I'll definitely take it on those days.
[doctor]  And does it seem to work pretty well still? Are you happy with it?
[patient]  Yeah, it does it works great.
[doctor]  Wonderful, good to hear. And then I'm assuming you're staying away from the peanuts. Last year you had told me it worked with, you worked with Enterprise Renacar, and one of the cars had a lot of peanuts in it that you were cleaning out, and that gave you hives. When you had touched it, is that correct?
[patient]  Yep, that's correct.
[doctor]  Okay, and has there been anything like that since that experience?
[patient]  No, I don't think so. I definitely became more cautious after that. So I usually wear long sleeves and change my gloves every time now. So I haven't had a reaction, but I imagine that I probably came in a contact with cars that had peanuts in them, but they just didn't touch my skin.
[doctor]  Super and it sounds like you're really smart about it
[patient]  Yeah, and the airplanes, they have peanuts. They give everyone two, so...
[doctor]  Okay, and you have an epic pen that K that you keep with you, correct?
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  Okay, and I'm assuming you're going to need refills. Um, I can call you in a new set for the year. Typically, of course, they expire within a year.
[patient]  Yeah, okay.
[doctor]  And I remember, um, sometime previously you've had some testing for tree nuts, but you do have almonds and cashews, correct? And, and you do okay with them, or do you avoid all tree nuts?
[patient]  I do tend to avoid all of them, but I recall eating some almonds at one point, really soon after we discussed, I might not be allergic to tree nuts anymore.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  And I remember having them and nothing happened, but I usually just tend to stay away from them, um, really if I can help it.
[doctor]  Okay, so sometimes when people have a peanut allergy, the nuts in general just aren't very important to them. So it is very common to avoid both. So let's do this. I'll have Helen come in and I would love to complete a breathing test on you. If your breathing numbers are looking great, we can work on getting you something lower than Wixula. If you look at all of our asthma regimens, it is a stepwise process and Wixula is a combination of two medications in one. And well maybe you don't need both of them. Maybe you just need one of them. So we can work our way backwards.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  And so the breathing test will help give us some more guidance. We will look at the results in just a moment.
[patient]  All right, and so this past year I did get into the bad habit of vaping and smoking, but I've been trying to cut that out. So I should be good, and now I only do just a little bit, and I'm trying to quit. So I'm sure that might have an effect.
[doctor]  It can. So, what we can do today is compare your results with prior results probably before you started smoking or using the vape.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Yeah, and we'll see where you stand at that point.
[patient]  Alright, that sounds good.
[doctor]  Well, let me go ahead and listen. So hop on up here for me.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Alright, so your ears look good, a little bit of wax on both sides. Can I see inside your mouth? Big A.
[patient]  Ah
[doctor]  Good. Okay, let me take a peek in your nose. All right, good. You can put your mask back on.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  And go ahead, take a big breath in and out. Good. Your lungs sound terrific. I'll listen to your heart. Breathe quietly. Okay, very good.
[patient]  Awesome!
[doctor]  So your breathing test is about the same as it was a couple years ago and actually looks a little bit better. You may not remember, but when we last completed the test in 2019, do you recall if you were feeling lousy at the time?
[patient]  I think it was the smoke. There were so many fires at that point and I remember coming in and looking out the window and all you saw was the orange and the smoke.
[doctor]  Yes, you're absolutely right. That was a bad year. That was my first fall here, and I was really alarmed. Well, that explains why at that time your numbers were a little bit lower, and today they look better. Here's what I think, so you'll have Kaiser currently, correct?
[patient]  Correct.
[doctor]  Okay, most insurances do limit what we can use.
[patient]  Yeah, I do know that.
[doctor]  Okay, so option one would be to continue using Wixilla, like you're using it now. We would classify it as off-label and you can use it once a day instead of twice a day, which is fine. Some people do that because they just need it once a day, so that's an option. Option two would be to actually back up to an inhaler that just has one med.
[patient]  MM
[doctor]  So the one that Kaiser covers is Alvesco. The thing about Alvesco, though, is that it would be two puffs in the morning and two puffs at night. So it's a bit more work. It's not breath activated, but we could step down the lowest dose to see how you do. Some of the newer guidelines for asthma that were published this year is recommending trying to treat people with inhalers like wixula or Alvesco only when you're ill or say during smoke season. So minimizing their use to those periods of time versus all year, unless you found out that you're getting. Inaudible nine minutes and 25 seconds sick having issues every month, then that would indicate would pull back too much.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  that we had too much, yeah.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  So we could step back and possibly get you to the point where you just use those inhalers when you're ill or at smoke season, but at the first step to do any of that would be to try to drop down to just alvesco.
[patient]  Okay, that actually sounds really good.
[doctor]  Okay great. So I will call that in for you. It will be the lower dose 80 micrograms and you'll have to do two puffs twice a day.
[patient]  Alright.
[doctor]  Okay, and that'll be on the box when I call it in. You can put the wicks-ill off to the side, but don't throw it away just in case the alvesco doesn't work well for you.
[patient]  Okay, got it.
[doctor]  And then ideally we would repeat your breathing test in four months to see how you're doing and then be able to document that you're doing well. Sometimes not always, the military will require documentation on breathing tests.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Is your pharmacy still the same or did you update it with Helen?
[patient]  Ya believe she updated it. It should be Kaiser Permanente Broadway.
[doctor]  Okay, perfect. I'll make sure it's the alvesco and then I'll renew your albuterol and epipan as well.
[patient]  Awesome, thank you.
[doctor]  You're welcome. Uh, then the ZerTech. Do you pick it up over the counter or do you get it as a prescription?
[patient]  I just get over the counter.
[doctor]  Okay, got it. And do you have a nebulizer that you would need refills on?
[patient]  I don't think I need any refills. I haven't used that in such a long time. I think the last time was when I had bronchitis or there was few select times when I had to use it when I was a kid.
[doctor]  Okay good. Well I think we have our game plan.
[patient]  Okay, awesome.
[doctor]  and do the Elvesco 2 puffs twice a day. And you're all butyl if you need it. The Zertek 10 milligrams as you need it and continue to stay away from peanuts and tree nuts and I'll refill your EpiPen.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Alright, so we've got it.
[patient]  Great!
[doctor]  I'll write I'll have you take this to the front and I'm going to say four months recheck for asthma and we'll repeat the spirometer spirometry at that time
[patient]  Okay, sounds good.
[doctor]  Alright well thanks so much and you have a great day.

Follow-up for asthma, allergic rhinitis, and food allergy.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Emily Hernandez is a 20-year-old female presenting today for an annual follow-up for asthma, allergic rhinitis, and food allergy. Due to insurance changes during the interim of our last office appointment from 04/2020, she was switched from Symbicort to Wixela. She uses Zyrtec in the spring, summer, and fall for her seasonal allergy symptoms, which tends to work well. She has known peanut and tree nut allergies, which she tries to avoid. She does tolerate almonds and cashew.

Mrs. Hernandez is trying to join the military, who require a certain fitness level without use of a rescue or maintenance inhaler, so she has been weaning off her inhalers. She uses albuterol prior to a run, but otherwise functions without it. She has been reducing her Wixela dose, using 1 inhalation once daily 3 times per week, with remaining days using it twice per day as prescribed. She feels this is working well. She denies urgent care or emergency room visits for respiratory issues in the past year. She denies requiring prednisone for breathing issues in the past year.

She hopes to be enlisted in the military in early spring of 2022. She is currently undergoing exertional testing to this purpose. She explains that this gives hers 6 to 7 months to show that she can exert herself without needing any inhalers.

Over the past year, she admits to vaping and smoking, though she is trying to quit and has cut down her use significantly.

She notes having a nebulizer but denies needing it recently and has only used it in her past for upper respiratory infections and as a child a few times.

Mrs. Hernandez uses Zyrtec during the spring and fall but does not typically have to use it consistently during the summer. She confirms she has been taking Zyrtec 3 days per week when she works outside, and it works well to control her symptoms.

She has been successfully avoiding peanuts. Incident from last year was reviewed where she was exposed to peanuts when she was cleaning an Enterprise rental car that had a lot of peanuts in it. She developed contact hives when the peanuts encountered her skin. Over the past year she denies additional accidental exposures. She wears long sleeves and changes her gloves between each cleaning. She thinks it is likely that she has been in contact with cars that contained peanuts, but due to her protective measures she did not touch them directly. She confirmed she always keeps an EpiPen with her.

The patient is also avoiding tree nuts. She did ingest almonds without issue following our discussion that she could try them. Despite tolerating them well, she continues to avoid all tree nuts.

PAST HISTORY

Medical
Asthma.
Allergy rhinitis.
Food allergies to peanut and tree nuts.

SOCIAL HISTORY

Currently smokes tobacco and vapes, trying to reduce and interested in cessation in preparation for joining the army.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

Wixela Inhub 250 mcg-50 mcg/dose powder for inhalation. 1 puff 2 times daily in the morning and evening.
Proair HFA as needed.
EpiPen as needed.
Alvesco 80 mcg 2 puff 2 times daily.

ALLERGIES

Peanuts cause a severe, anaphylactic reaction.
Montelukast sodium, “seizure-like” reaction.

RESULTS

Asthma Control Test (ACT) Results: ACT score is 21.
Current food skin test sensitivities include peanuts.

ASSESSMENT

• Moderate persistent asthma, uncomplicated.
• Allergic rhinitis.
• Anaphylactic reaction due to peanuts.

Emily Hernandez is a 20-year-old female who presented today for her yearly follow-up appointment for asthma, allergic rhinitis, and food allergy.

PLAN

Moderate persistent asthma, uncomplicated
The patient has been using Wixela inhaler daily and admits to reducing her daily dose to one puff per day, 3-4 days per week as she feels she does not always need it the full dose. Additionally, she aspires to join the military and she must meet certain physical fitness requirements without the use of her inhaler. I counseled the patient on current asthma treatment guidelines which recommend using Wixela and Alvesco only when needed during periods of illness. The patient agreed to reducing her medicine to Alvesco which is a single medication, versus 2 in Welixa. The patient will continue to use her albuterol inhaler as needed. Her ACT score is 21 today and her spirometry test today was better than it was in 2019, though she recalls that it was smoky from wildfires during her last breathing test.

Allergic rhinitis
She will continue to use Zyrtec as needed, primarily during spring and fall and sometimes in summer. Her current dose cadence is 3 times per week when she works outside. Symptoms are currently under control.

Anaphylactic reaction due to peanuts
The patient has successfully avoided peanuts. Plan is to continue with current methods to avoid exposure. I will refill her EpiPen which expires annually.

INSTRUCTIONS

Moderate persistent asthma, uncomplicated
Start Alvesco, 2 puffs twice daily. Keep Wixela in case Alvesco does not work well. Continue albuterol as needed. Return in 4 months to repeat ACT and spirometry testing.

Allergic rhinitis
Continue Zyrtec 10 mg daily as needed.

Anaphylactic reaction due to peanuts
Continue strict avoidance of peanuts. I will refill her EpiPen today."
virtscribe,D2N139,"[doctor]  All right, new patient, Jordan Roberts, date of birth, March 2nd, 1972. He's a 49-year-old HM with hypertension and palpitations. Please copy forward his thyroid profile from March 1st, 2021.
[doctor]  Hello Mr. Roberts, how are you doing today?
[patient]  I'm fine, thank you.
[doctor]  Good. Good. So, I saw you were recently in the emergency room with high blood pressure and some competitions.
[patient]  Yeah, that was back in March, I think, but my girlfriend and I, we talked about it. And on that day, I had a few cups of coffee and no breakfast. So, I think it was probably more of a panic attack than anything else.
[doctor]  Yeah, have you felt it again since?
[patient]  Oh no.
[doctor]  Okay, so tell me about the blood pressure then.
[patient]  Well, I've had issues with my blood pressure since I was young.
[doctor]  Do you have a family history of this?
[patient]  Yeah, a lot of my family does have high blood pressure.
[doctor]  I see.
[patient]  Yeah, I thought it was getting better and I have a new primary doctor and she put me on a new medication about a month ago.
[doctor]  Uh, can you tell me which medications are taking?
[patient]  My new med is a combo med something 40 to 25.
[doctor]  Okay. Um, yes, I see that in your chart. The Benacar HCT. It has hydrochlorothiazide in it.
[patient]  Yeah, that's it. My water pill I call it.
[doctor]  Okay. Are you still taking the emlodipine? 10 milligrams daily?
[patient]  Yes, I am.
[doctor]  That's a good start on a regimen. Are you checking your blood pressure at home? And if yes, what numbers are you seeing?
[patient]  um every day.
[doctor]  Awesome!
[patient]  Yeah, every morning I take it when I get up and it's been running at about 146 to 155 lately.
[doctor]  So, you're not down in the 120's yet?
[patient]  No, not yet. Well, we're trying to get there though.
[doctor]  Okay. Uh, how are you doing with your salt intake?
[patient]  I'm trying to back off of it. I think I'm doing good with it, not eating too much.
[doctor]  Good. It plays a huge part in lowering your pressure and staying away from salt is important. I'll give you some information on the dash eating plan, which is the only eating plan that has been shown to lower blood pressure.
[patient]  Sound good.
[doctor]  Are you doing any exercise?
[patient]  I do try to walk on the treadmill when I can.
[doctor]  Okay, great. Oh, alright. So, let's take a look.
[patient]  All right.
[doctor]  You're going to hear me talk throughout your exam just so I can make sure I get everything documented.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  So, use my general physical exam template. Let me take a listen to you and make sure everything sounds good.
[patient]  All right.
[doctor]  Your heart and lungs sound good, so that's great.
[patient]  Good to hear.
[doctor]  Alright, go ahead and lie down. Uh, and let me know if anywhere I press Hertz.
[patient]  Nope. No where.
[doctor]  Alright, so I'm going to take a look at your ankles and feet. I'm just going to look for some swelling.
[patient]  All right.
[doctor]  All right, it all looks good. Go ahead and sit up. So in terms of getting that pressure down, you're on three meds that are maxed out and your blood pressure is still not down. And the question is what do we need to do to get your to get it down? Your potassium one week ago was 4.0. Has it been redone since in the last week?
[patient]  Oh no.
[doctor]  Okay. For as good for your potassium level, some people have what is called resistant hypertension that is driven by something else in their body. Often it is a form, a hormonal response. If I were to take 10 people under the age of 50 who have high blood pressure, who developed it at a young age, 8 out of 10 would respond to reduce salt in their diet with a lower blood pressure. But for the 2 out of 10, there is something else driving it, a parathyroid levels, or something called your adrenal glands over produce, aldosterone, which we call hyper aldosterone.
[patient]  Okay, so is there something we can do about it?
[doctor]  In these cases, there's medicine called a spironylactone that is very effective at dropping the ALD aldosterone level and your blood pressure and I think we should give that a try.
[patient]  Alright, I mean, I'm willing to give it a try.
[doctor]  Okay, so let's discuss the piss, the possible risk of being on hydrochlorothiazide, which is the fluid med that you're now on, and the spironal actone. One issue is that they can affect your electrolyte balance. They can also cause dehydration. So when so you got to make sure that you hydrate. If you do not hydrate and you get dehydrated, you will know it because you will get dizzy standing up. Second thing is the spironal actone can raise your potassium too far. It's rare, but it can. You're starting with your potassium at four, so that gives us some room.
[patient]  Alright, I guess that makes me feel a little bit better.
[doctor]  Yeah. And then the third thing is that spironal aceton combined with hydrochlorazide, chlorothiazide, can cause your sodium levels to go down. Now, this does not mean that you need to be eating more salt, okay? But it does mean that you will need to do blood tests in two weeks to make sure that it's okay.
[patient]  All right, no, that I can do. Um, are there any other side effects I need to worry about?
[doctor]  Uh, dizziness possibly, as well as, uh, one in 100 guys might develop tenderness in their chest, swollen breasts, or enlarged breasts. This is a rare side effect, um, called gynecomastia. And if it happens, you just cut the medication and you let me know, but it is very uncommon.
[patient]  I'll definitely let you know if that happens.
[doctor]  Okay, we'll keep working at it until your blood pressure gets better. It can be tricky when your blood pressure starts to go up at a young age though. It is important to get it under control because it can lead to your heart getting bigger or enlarged. Same thing that happens when you lift weights and your muscles get bigger. And if your heart pumps against high blood pressure, it can eventually lead to heart failure.
[patient]  I understand.
[doctor]  Yeah, so getting that under control is really important to help prevent kidney failure, strokes, and things like that that you're at high risk for with high blood pressure.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  The American Heart Association has a website called heart.org. It has a lot of really good information about blood pressure to teach, to teach you about it, and how to control your diet with exercise. If you do your treadmill routinely for 30 minutes or so most days, that could be seven to ten points off your blood pressure.
[patient]  Really? I didn't realize that.
[doctor]  Yeah, yeah. It's very important to be active, lower your salt, and increase your potassium. The goal is to keep your salt under 2000 milligrams a day. The actual recommendation is, is 1500 milligrams per day, but most people have a hard time with that. So just take a look at the website and the dash diet information. That will give you a lot of tips and information to help you start learning about this stuff.
[patient]  Okay, I'll definitely check that out.
[doctor]  All right, so we'll try this for on a lactone and schedule a follow up in two weeks to check your blood pressure and electrolytes. If the new med doesn't work, the next step is going to be the resistant hypertension clinic.
[patient]  All right.
[doctor]  All right, so they will look into secondary causes of your hypertension. They have access to newer procedure-based technologies that can lower your blood pressure without medication. For example, there is something called a renal denervation where they go inside the artery that feeds your kidney with almost like a little coil and heat that artery up. When they do that, they can block the nerve endings that get into your kidneys and lower your blood pressure.
[patient]  That's interesting.
[doctor]  Yeah, so that procedure has been shown to lower blood pressure by 10 points. There are of course some risks, so not everyone is a candidate, but we'll cross that road when we need to, and let's just see how you do with the addition of the medication.
[patient]  Sounds good to me.
[doctor]  Alright, so we will see you in two weeks then.
[patient]  Sound good. Thanks, Doc.
[doctor]  Yeah, you're welcome. Let me know if you have any questions.
[patient]  뭐 do
[doctor]  All right, have a great day, Mr. Roberts.
[patient]  You too.
[doctor]  Mr. Roberts presents with resistant hypertension. He's on three meds and maximum dose. I have added spironalactone to his regimen. We will need to monitor his potassium and sodium. He will have a metabolic panel and blood pressure check in two weeks. Next medication would be carvedilol, which I try to avoid giving. It's potential for erectile dysfunction. I have talked to the patient about that, and the potential side effects of spironalactone, including the gynecomastia and electrolyte disturbances. If he is not controlled on spironalactone, the next step would be sending him to resistant hypertension clinic.","CHIEF COMPLAINT

High blood pressure and palpitations.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Jordan Roberts is a 49-year-old with a long history of hypertension and an acute episode of palpitations.

In March, Mr. Roberts went to the emergency room for palpitations and hypertension. He attributed this to a panic attack, but also stated he consumed several cups of coffee on an empty stomach the morning of. He denies additional episodes of palpitations.

He has been monitoring his blood pressure at home daily, obtaining systolic blood pressure readings of 146 to 155. He does report a family history of hypertension. Additionally, he has been monitoring his salt intake and feels he is doing well at reducing it. He also walks on his treadmill as often as he can.

He has a new primary care physician who started him on a new medication Benicar HCT, which he has been using for the past month.

PAST HISTORY

Medical
Hypertension.

FAMILY HISTORY

Several family members positive for hypertension.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

Benicar HCT 40 mg/25 mg
Amlodipine 10 mg daily.

Physical Examination

Cardiovascular
Normal rate, regular rhythm, S2 normal, normal heart sounds, and normal pulses.

Pulmonary/Chest
Breath sounds normal. 

Abdominal
There is no tenderness.

Musculoskeletal
There is no edema.

RESULTS

Thyroid profile 03/01/2021.

ASSESSMENT

• Resistant hypertension.

Mr. Roberts presents with resistant hypertension, with systolic blood pressure readings between 146-155. He is currently on maximal doses for 3 medications.

PLAN

I have added spironolactone to his regimen which will require monitoring of his potassium and sodium. We will schedule him for a follow up in 2 weeks to complete a basic metabolic panel and check his blood pressure. Next medication to consider adding is carvedilol. I have tried to avoid this, given the potential for issues with erectile dysfunction. I counseled the patient about spironolactone side effects, including gynecomastia and electrolyte disturbances, as well as his increased risk of dehydration, with one sign to watch for being dizziness. If we are not able to improve his blood pressure with spironolactone, the next step would be sending him to the resistant hypertension clinic.

I provided and reviewed with Mr. Roberts the American Heart association website (heart.org) and encouraged him to access for tips on lowering his salt intake and increasing his potassium intake. His maximum salt intake should be 1500 to <2000 mg per day. He was provided materials to follow the DASH diet and encouraged to meet 30-min of walking most days.

INSTRUCTIONS

Schedule follow up appointment in 2 weeks for blood pressure check and basic metabolic panel. Reduce sodium intake to 1500 to <2000 mg per day. Follow DASH diet.

virtscribe,D2N140,"[doctor]  Brittany Edwards, 07, 1898. She's a return visit for IBS with functional abdominal pain, nausea vomiting. And that's, Edwards is a pleasant, 32-year-old female who was last seen in August of 2019 with flares of abdominal pain, who was diagnosed with irritable bowl that was treated with bento.
[doctor]  She had a previous prescription for Reglin that she received from the emergency room that she used as needed for nausea. She was instructed to start a low-dose fiber supplement, such as Citricel, Daily, Probiotics to help with gas and bloating, bent a lot to four times daily for intestinal cramping and stop Reglin and used Zofran as needed. Neuromodulators such as Eleville and Bussper were discussed, but not started.
[doctor]  Hello, how are you?
[patient]  I'm okay.
[doctor]  Good. How have you been feeling?
[patient]  Not so good.
[doctor]  Yeah, so my nurse told me you've been going out to eat some on Friday nights and Saturday nights and that you have had some spicy foods or spicy shrimp.
[patient]  Yeah, I have.
[doctor]  Okay, well, your gut probably does not always appreciate that.
[patient]  No, it doesn't like it at all.
[doctor]  Yeah, so IBS is one of those things where you're very sensitive to certain things such as spicy foods or fatty foods and alcohol. And this can cause lower belly stuff like cramps or you can get up or belly stuff such as nausea.
[patient]  I've been getting both.
[doctor]  Okay. Um, so how frequently have you been getting or having a bowel movement on normal days?
[patient]  I'm starting to notice it's between two and three times a day.
[doctor]  Okay. And are they soft stools or form stools?
[patient]  um... they're formed
[doctor]  Okay, and after you've gone out either drinking with your friends, do you tend to have more diarrhea?
[patient]  Yeah, I do.
[doctor]  Okay. Do you feel it's the food or the alcohol or both?
[patient]  Uh, well usually go to Friday's restaurant. I always eat pasta, the chicken alfredo.
[doctor]  Okay, I can ask. I can bet it's the Alfredo sauce.
[patient]  But it normally doesn't bother me.
[doctor]  Okay. Well, pasta can make you bloated, but it doesn't usually cause diarrhea. Grilled chicken is usually all right. Alfredo, though, is higher in fat, and it does contain dairy. But you're saying it usually doesn't bother you?
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Okay. What type of alcohol drink do you drink when you are there? Is it a sweet drink?
[patient]  Most of the time it's either tequila or dark liquor. I prefer patron, but if I get brown liquor, I only get two. Um, every now and again, I'll drink a martini.
[doctor]  Sometimes it's the mixer they tend to put in the drinks, but it can be a variety of things. So when you're not eating out or drinking, what we do on a daily basis does help keep us regular. So when it does flare up, it's see, it might not be as bad. Have you had any luck using the fiber like citric cell regularly?
[patient]  Oh no, I guess I need to find a new drink.
[doctor]  Okay. And how is it during the week?
[patient]  Like what I eat.
[doctor]  Yeah, and with the diarrhea and abdominal pain.
[patient]  Right now I'm still having the cramping and sharp pains, so I've been avoiding heavy foods. I did have some fried chicken today though.
[doctor]  and was everything all right after that?
[patient]  Yeah, for the most part.
[doctor]  Okay, remember it's also the portion sizes. So I mean if you eat a little and you feel fine, then that's okay. You have to just really watch the portions.
[patient]  Okay good. I can't go out, go without some fried chicken at least once in a while.
[doctor]  Sounds good. Alright, well let's take a look at you today and we'll do a brief physical exam. You will hear me call out some findings. I will answer any questions and we will discuss once we have finished the exam.
[patient]  Sound good.
[doctor]  Alright, so the patient is alert and cooperative, appears state at age. Alright, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and lungs are clear to your hospitalization bilaterally. Heart regular rate and rhythm. Alright, so if you could just lay back for me, and I'll examine your abdomen.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  All right. Do you have any tenderness?
[patient]  No, not really.
[doctor]  Okay, so the abdomen is soft, non-tender. No masses or organomethally. And let me take a listen. Normal active vowel sounds. All right, you can go ahead and sit up now. Thank you.
[doctor]  All right, so first I want you to try citricil. It does come in a tablet. You should use it twice daily for regularity. Then I would say if you know you're going out and will possibly have diarrhea as a result, you can go ahead and use your bentel 20 milligrams. You can do one tablet before you eat and then repeat up to four times daily. And then on days when you feel good, you don't have to use anything. And then on Friday before you leave the house, you can take a bentel and put one in your pocket for later. And then you can repeat the same thing on Saturday if you want. And that will be totally fine.
[patient]  Okay, that sounds good.
[doctor]  Okay, and so you're bento, that's the anti-spasm medication, and I would take the higher dose.
[patient]  Can I refill of that?
[doctor]  Yes, absolutely. Uh, so take one tablet about 30 to 45 minutes before leaving the house, and then the second tablet at the restaurant. Then with the nausea, I think we should try and see if you can recognize a pattern with what you're eating and drinking, um, about, like, what makes it worse.
[patient]  Yeah, I noticed I've been doing better with drinking water instead of sodas.
[doctor]  Okay, good. And then for your Zofran, I wouldn't take that ahead of time. Just plan on drinking plenty of water.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Okay, and you can take it, but before you do, we want to try to reduce the triggers. So watch out for greasy or fatty foods and sugary drinks.
[patient]  Okay, I can do that.
[doctor]  Okay. And so, however, if it is not just these isolated in-sea incidents and the symptoms are happening all the time, we could put you on a long-term medication that would take, that you would take every night. And so then you don't have to use so much bento or the zofran. How do you feel about that?
[patient]  I was actually going to ask you about something like that to help avoid flares altogether.
[doctor]  Yeah, there is. And it actually works on the chemicals in your brain that are causing your gut to be overly sensitive. One is called elevel, but the only drawback is that it can make you a little sleepy. How does that sound?
[patient]  That sounds like a much better plan.
[doctor]  Okay great, we can definitely do that. Uh, just take it every night before bedtime.
[patient]  Okay, that sounds good. Thank you so much.
[doctor]  You're welcome. And so I've gone ahead and sent your prescriptions to your pharmacy. Just give us a call if you have any questions or need us for anything else. And then let's plan on touching base through my card email in about a month to just check in to see how you're doing with symptoms. Okay?
[patient]  Okay, that sounds good. Thank you.
[doctor]  You're welcome, and have a good rest of your day.
[doctor]  So, review of symptoms is positive for diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal pain. Assessment and plan. Brittany Edwards is a pleasant female with IBS and functional abdominal pain, aggravated by high stress, poor eating habits, and poor sleeping habits. I've encouraged dietary and lifestyle modifications, as well as starting a neuromodulator such as Eleville 25 milligrams at bedtime for IBS.
[doctor]  She can use bentyl 20 milligrams as needed 30 to 45 minutes prior to eating out at a restaurant. She can also use zofran if needed. However, I have encouraged her to reduce greasy and fatty foods and alcohol consumption. I have asked her to follow up in one month by emailing over my cart regarding any side effects and issues, or issues with eleval, or if adjustments are needed.","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Follow up irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Ms. Brittany Edwards is a pleasant 32-year-old female who returns in follow up for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) with functional abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.

Ms. Edwards was last seen in August 2019 with flares of abdominal pain and was diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome that was treated with Bentyl. She had a previous prescription for Reglan that she received from the emergency room that she used as needed for nausea. She was instructed to start a low dose fiber supplement such as Citrucel daily, probiotics to help with gas and bloating, and Bentyl up to 4 times daily for intestinal cramping. She was instructed to discontinue Reglan and to use Zofran as needed for nausea. Neuromodulators such as Elavil and Buspar were discussed but not started.

Ms. Edwards continues to have intermittent abdominal symptoms. Monday through Thursday she has less flare ups of her symptoms but states she is currently having cramps and sharp pains. She describes she recently ate shrimp which caused her to have both upper and lower abdominal pain and bloating. However, she notices episodes of diarrhea after eating chicken alfredo and consuming alcohol. She does not believe the alfredo contributes to her symptoms. The patient states she consumes 2 drinks when out of either tequila or brown liquor and occasionally a martini. She does her best to avoid “heavy foods,” but ate fried chicken today without any symptoms. She has stopped drinking sodas which has been helpful. The patient reports passing 2-3 formed stools a day.

virtscribe,D2N141,"[doctor]  Okay, so our next patient is Christopher Watson. Date of birth April 12th, 1934. Mr. Watson is an 86-year-old male who returns and follow-up for adult hydrocephalus. This is his first visit since undergoing SH Shunt Surgery. Excuse me on August 1st, 2020.
[doctor]  I have followed Mr. Watson since May of 2020 when he first presented with eight to ten years of progressive gate impairment, cognitive impairment, and decreased bladder control. We established a diagnosis of adult hydrocephalus with a Spino catheter protocol in June 2020 and he underwent shunt surgery on August 1, 2020. A metronics straight up programmable shunt in the ventricular peritoneal configuration was programmed at a level 2.0 was placed.
[doctor]  Good morning, mister. What's in? Who is the nice lady you have with you today?
[patient]  Hi Doc, this is my daughter Teresa. She's the one who helps me keep things straight.
[doctor]  Mr. Watson, have you been sick or been hospitalized since your shoe? Shunt surgery three months ago.
[patient]  Uh, not that I recall.
[patient]  No, he hasn't. He has been doing much better.
[doctor]  Good, I'm glad to hear that.
[doctor]  Before surgery, you were having some progressive problems that affected your walking, thinking, and bladder control. Are these symptoms better, worse, or unchanged?
[patient]  His walking has improved. He's now able to walk to the dining room just fine. But he could not do that before surgery. He still has times where I have to help him.
[doctor]  That's impressive, Mr. Watson.
[patient]  Yeah, I guess.
[patient]  Now his bladder control did improve some after surgery, but now seems to have leveled out. So he is wearing diapers.
[doctor]  No issues with sores from wearing the diaper and any decreased or painful urination.
[patient]  No, not at all.
[doctor]  And how about cognition?
[patient]  I think I'm better. I don't feel lost when talking to someone anymore.
[patient]  Dad and I both think my sister, Hannah, summarized it best. She said, I feel like I can have a normal conversation with him again.
[doctor]  That's so wonderful. Now have you had any headaches or pain where the shunt is?
[patient]  No, it hasn't bothered me one bit.
[doctor]  Okay, and any pain in your belly at all?
[patient]  can't say that I have.
[doctor]  Okay, sounds like you have been improving. Alrighty, Mr. What's in? I'm going to step out of the room while my resident comes in to do a few tests for me. Is that all right?
[patient]  Sound good.
[doctor]  Okay, I'm going to go out and review the CT scan you had last month, and then we'll chat about it when I come in.
[doctor]  Alrighty, Mr. Watson. So you definitely have made some improvements since the shunt surgery. Now on CT, Skendou, I do believe I see a tiny bit of blood fluid collection in the right parietal region. Now, I don't believe that that's causing any symptoms and I. It actually wasn't documented by the radiologist when he read the CT scan.
[patient]  So what does that mean?
[doctor]  Just that I would like to leave the shunt set for another two to three months before we go in changing it. Like I said, if you're not having any headaches or pain and you have improved, so that's all good for me. So really there's, there's nothing to worry about.
[patient]  Alright, so I'll come back in three months.
[doctor]  Yep, that's right.
[patient]  I do have a question for you though.
[doctor]  Yeah, of course.
[patient]  Do you think I will be able to drive again?
[doctor]  Oh man, Mr. Watson, I knew you were going to ask me that one. I think at this point, it's unlikely that your movement speed will improve to the level that would be needed for you to pass the driver's safety evaluation. Now, I will say that I do occasionally of patients who surprise me by improving over a nine to 12-month range. And that definitely could be you. You could definitely pass it at that point. So if you improve and we can continue to talk about that, then you know, I think it could be possible. And I'd be happy to recommend it.
[doctor]  Now, you could definitely also enroll in a driver safety program without my recommendation. So you could kind of do that preemptively, and then we could continue to watch for your improvement as we go.
[patient]  Okay, I kind of figure that anyway, but I just thought I'd ask. I don't like to burden anyone when I just need to run to the store, but I also know that I need to be safe.
[doctor]  Yeah, your safety is our number one priority and you know, I'm sure your daughters don't mind as much, right? They want to keep you here and have you safe. But I overall am very pleased with how much you have improved. And so, I'm sure when we talk again in three months, we'll continue to be on that upward trajectory or improvement.
[patient]  I sure hope so, doc.
[patient]  We really appreciate all that you've done. Do we make the appointment out front?
[doctor]  Yeah, that would be great. The girls up front will take care of you and get you settled for three months from now. And you both take care, alright?

Follow up adult hydrocephalus, 3 months status post shunt surgery.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Mr. Christopher Watson is an 86-year-old male who returns in follow up of adult hydrocephalus. This is his first visit since undergoing shunt surgery 08/01/2020. He is accompanied by his daughter, Theresa, together they give his history.

I have followed Mr. Watson since May 2020. He presented with 8-10 years of progressive gait impairment, cognitive impairment, and decreased bladder control. We established a diagnosis of adult hydrocephalus with the spinal catheter protocol in June 2020 and he underwent shunt surgery on 08/01/2020. A Medtronic Strata programmable shunt in the ventriculoperitoneal configuration programmed at level 2.0 was placed.

Mr. Watson has had no hospitalizations or other illnesses since I last saw him. With respect to his walking, his daughter states that he is now able to walk to the dining room just fine but could not before his surgery. His balance has improved though he still has some walking impairment. With respect to his bladder control, initially there was some improvement, but he has leveled off and he wears a diaper. With respect to his cognition, both Theresa and the patient say that his thinking has improved. The other daughter, Hannah summarized it best according to the two of them, she said “I feel like I can have a normal conversation with him again.” Mr. Watson has had no headaches and no pain at the shunt site or in the abdomen.

PAST HISTORY

Urinary incontinence.
Adult hydrocephalus.
Gait impairment.
Cognitive impairment.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

• Constitutional Symptoms: Significant for impaired ability to carry out daily functions. Negative for fever or unintentional weight loss.
• Genitourinary: Significant for urinary incontinence and wearing a diaper. Negative for genital sores, decreased or painful output.
• Neurological: Significant for continued walking impairment and cognitive impairment. Negative for headaches, recent falls, or hallucinations.
• Psychiatric: Negative for depression, excessive worrying, or mood swings.

VITALS

Blood pressure 124/80, heart rate is 64, respiratory rate is 18, weight 174 pounds, and pain is 0/10.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Constitutional
Mr. Watson is a pleasant and cooperative man who is able to converse easily though his daughter adds some details.

Head and Face
The shunt site was clean, dry, and intact and confirmed at a setting of 2.0.

Neurological
Mental status: Tested for recent and remote memory, attention span, concentration, and fund of knowledge. He scored 26/30 on the MMSE when tested with spelling and 25/30 when tested with calculations. Of note, he was able to get two of the three memory words with cuing and the third one with multiple choice. This was a slight improvement over his initial score of 23/30 with calculations and 24/30 with spelling and at that time he was unable to remember any memory words with cuing and only one with multiple choice.
Gait: Tested using the Tinetti assessment tool. He was tested without an assistive device and received a gait score of 6-8/12 and a balance of score of 12/16 for a total score of 18-20/28. This has slightly improved from his initial score of 15-17/28.
Cranial Nerves: Pupils are equal. Extraocular movements are intact. Face symmetric. No dysarthria.
Motor: Normal for bulk and strength.
Coordination: Slow for finger-to-nose.

RESULTS

CT scan of the head from 10/15/2020: It shows a frontal horn span at the level of foramen of Munro of 4.6 cm with a 3rd ventricular contour that is flat with the span of 10 mm. By my reading, there is a tiny amount of blood in the right frontal region with just a tiny subdural collection. This was not noticed by the radiologist who stated no extra axial fluid collections. There is also substantial small vessel ischemic change.

ASSESSMENT

• Adult hydrocephalus.
• Gait impairment.
• Urinary incontinence and urgency.
• Cognitive impairment.

Mr. Watson has made some improvement with his hydrocephalus since shunt surgery. There is a tiny fluid collection in the right parietal region. I do not believe that this tiny amount of fluid is symptomatic, and it was not documented by the radiologist when he read the CT scan.

Mr. Watson asked me about whether he will be able to drive again. Unfortunately, I think it is unlikely that his speed of movement will improve to a level that he will be able to pass a driver's safety evaluation, however, occasionally patients surprise me by improving enough over 9 to 12 months that they are able to pass such a test. I would certainly be happy to recommend such a test if I believe he is likely to pass it and he is always welcome to enroll in a driver's safety program without my recommendation, however, I think it is exceeding unlikely that he has the capability of passing this rigorous test at this time. I also think it is quite likely he will not regain sufficient speed of motion to pass such a test.

PLAN

I had a long discussion with the patient and his daughter. We are all pleased that he has started to make some improvement with his hydrocephalus because of the fluid collection in the right parietal region, I would like to leave the setting at 2.0 for another three months before we consider changing the shunt.

virtscribe,D2N142,"[doctor]  Amanda Taylor, birth date October 31, 1949. Patient is a 72-year-old woman who comes for follow-up for hypertension. Her history includes significant alcohol use disorder and, me, mild hypercholestrolemia. At last visit on April 16, her blood pressure was 130 over 90. After presenting at 150 over 100, she was prescribed hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 milligrams by mouth once daily and licenepal 20 milligrams by mouth once daily. CMP and CBC were essentially unremarkable.
[doctor]  Hi Miss Taylor, how are you today?
[patient]  Hi, I'm, I'm good. Thank you.
[doctor]  Thanks for coming in today.
[patient]  Yeah, no problem.
[doctor]  So, how have things been going for you?
[patient]  They've been alright. I'm struggling with not drinking. I wanted to discuss that uh shot that you had mentioned last time, but we didn't get to discuss it too much.
[doctor]  Okay, well I'll be happy to provide you with more information. So tell me when did you last have a drink?
[patient]  on Monday.
[doctor]  Okay, so you've gone a couple days without it?
[patient]  Yeah, yeah, I have.
[doctor]  Yeah, and how'd you been drinking for a while?
[patient]  Yep.
[doctor]  How much had? How much had you been drinking?
[patient]  for five times a week hard alcohol so you know
[doctor]  Okay, well it will certainly help your blood pressure if you're able to stop drinking.
[patient]  Yeah, yeah, I, I, I agree with you.
[doctor]  Okay, are you taking your blood pressure medications?
[patient]  Yeah, but I'm only taking half of the light's centipril.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  I, well, the first time I took it, I felt the thargic and tired. So I only took a half dose the next time. I felt much better and I didn't have the headaches or the swooshing that started in my left ear. So I feel like it's definitely helping, but I don't know. I know. It's not going to be okay until I stop drinking.
[doctor]  And are you also taking the full dose of the hydrochlorothiazide? Do you have any chest tightness or pressure or any shortness of breath?
[patient]  Yeah, I'm taking the full dose of that medicine too, and no none of those symptoms.
[doctor]  Okay, anything else I should be aware of or that we should be checking?
[patient]  MM Nom
[doctor]  Okay, good. Are you doing the blood pressure checks at home?
[patient]  Yes, yes I am.
[doctor]  Okay good. What kind of numbers are you seeing?
[patient]  Well, in the morning I'm seeing lower numbers than in the evening, where I run anywhere from like 130 to 145 or 150 over 95 to 100 on the bottom.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  But in the evenings if I sit there for a while and then take it, it goes down. Kind of like when I come here it's always high, but then it goes down. In the mornings it's generally more normal where it's supposed to be.
[doctor]  Oh
[patient]  And, mm, also I'm taking my medicine in the morning when I get up instead of in the evening.
[doctor]  Yeah, so it sounds like we are not too far out of where we want to be.
[patient]  Right in the middle.
[doctor]  Okay, well let me get a listen to your heart. Go ahead and hop up here.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Use my general exam template. All right, go ahead and take some deep breaths. Okay, good. Any fever, cough, shortness of breath or sore throat?
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  any recent travel or contact or exposure to the coronavirus.
[patient]  Nope.
[doctor]  Have you received your coronavirus vaccine?
[patient]  Yes, on February 9th.
[doctor]  Okay great. Alright well I'm just going to look at your ankles and feet. I'm looking for any signs of swelling.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Alright, well everything looks good. You can go ahead and sit up Miss Taylor. Alright, so the good news is everything is looking okay. I think we both agree if you were able to stop drinking your blood pressure would cease to be an issue for you.
[patient]  Yeah, I agree with that.
[doctor]  So, let us discuss the potential medicine to help you with that. What it does is it blocks some of the brain receptors that alcohol stimulates, and it tricks the brain into thinking it does not need alcohol, thereby cutting down the urges.
[patient]  the urge to drink or the constant thinking about it.
[doctor]  It actually will help with both.
[patient]  Okay, so is it like a one-time thing?
[doctor]  Generally the shot is given about once a month, it can also be given as a daily pill, but the shot does tend to work a bit better.
[patient]  You have taken things like this in the past, and if it is a pill, I know I won't take it. With a shot, it's not like you can untake it.
[doctor]  Yeah, that's true. And the shot has been shown to work. It is more just a matter of getting you in to get your shot a month later with the nurse.
[patient]  Yeah sure sure.
[doctor]  Okay, so it's called Naltrexone. I think the other name might be Vivitrol. Like I've said, the research on it is pretty good.
[patient]  I think I may have taken an outtrex on before.
[doctor]  Okay, yeah, maybe you have.
[patient]  Yeah, if it was available in a pill form, then I'm almost certain I've tried it before.
[doctor]  Okay, if this sounds good though, we can go ahead and get you started with the shot. I am looking and it looks like we have you coming back in on May 17 for your first shot. Does that sound good?
[patient]  Yeah, yeah, that sounds great. Are there any possible side effects?
[doctor]  Yeah, some people will experience some nausea, headache, dizziness, onchy anxiety, tiredness and trouble-sleeping, but generally the side effects are mild and should go away within a few days.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Then we can schedule you for follow up in June to see how you're doing.
[patient]  Alright, that sounds good.
[doctor]  All right, great. Well, otherwise stay with your current medicines, keep checking your blood pressure, and let's see if we can stop the alcohol for good. Let us know if you have any questions, or any issues come up after you receive the first dose.
[patient]  All right, sound good. Thank you.
[doctor]  You are welcome. Have a good rest of your day.
[patient]  You too.
[doctor]  Miss Taylor is drinking alcohol for to five days per week to access. No tobacco, no substance abuse, skin is moist, good trigger. On exam, she is alert, pleasant, and no acute distress. She is not diabetic. There is no tremor, no CVA tenderness, chest clear to percussion and osculation, un-labored breathing, cardiac rhythm regular, no murmur, no gallop, JVP flat, with a head at 90 degrees. She does not appear anxious, agitated or depressed. My impression, alcohol use disorder. She would like to start an L-trexone, which we have previously discussed. She will take the injectable form and start on May 17th. We're reviewed side effects and risks. The potential benefit of alcohol cessation would be highly beneficial to her for many reasons. High-pertension. She is taking Lycinoprol 10 milligrams daily and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 milligrams daily. Quite possibly her blood pressure will improve completely with cessation of alcohol. Her target BP is 130 to 140 over 70 to 80. I will see her back week of June 14th, which is likely around the time of her second L-trexone injection. I recommend upgrading influenza vaccination and shinrix. Number two, she did defer this.","CHIEF COMPLAINT

[patient]  Um, about the same as last time. Money is still swollen.
[doctor]  That was your right knee, correct? I take it the injection didn't help.
[patient]  It did, maybe for a couple of weeks.
[doctor]  That's it. And is it still painful?
[patient]  Yeah, it's pretty painful and now the whole leg's getting swollen.
[doctor]  Okay. What would you say your pain level is?
[patient]  I mean right now it's about a three or so, but typically on a normal day it's around six.
[doctor]  Okay, and it's been swollen like that for how long now.
[patient]  since I was last here a couple weeks after that. So about, maybe two months now.
[doctor]  Okay, but before it was just the knee?
[patient]  Yeah, the whole thing wasn't swollen like this, but I tried to wear compression socks a lot of the time, but it hasn't been helping.
[doctor]  Okay, okay, so that hasn't been working for you?
[patient]  I mean it helped to some degree, but it's still swollen, especially around the knee.
[doctor]  Hmm. Has it been keeping you from doing things during the day?
[patient]  Well, I slowed down a little bit and I found a few things too fast. But when it really hurts is when I've been sitting for a while and then I have to try and get up. I'm so stiff getting up I have to use a cane to get my bearings. I mean after a little bit it loosens up but that first getting up is real difficult.
[doctor]  Yeah, I can see. That makes sense. Have you been taking your medication regularly? You're on Zelgins, right?
[patient]  Yeah, the XR, I think it's 11 milligrams a day. Yeah, but I'm taking it every day and I'm also taking celebrates, which I started maybe two months ago.
[doctor]  Yes, the 200 MGS daily. How's that working for you?
[patient]  Pretty good, up until it started swelling again.
[doctor]  Okay, well, come sit over here and if you could take of your socks and shoes and we'll take a look at your knee. And just to let you know, I have a service now that writes my note about the visit, so you'll hear me call things out and describe what I see fully.
[patient]  Okay, gotcha.
[doctor]  Right, so let's check your leg. Can you straighten it and does it hurt?
[patient]  Yeah, why try to straighten it all the way it does.
[doctor]  Okay, range of motion slightly diminished. I'm going to press here, okay? And how about here? Hmm, I see some pitting around the knee and ankle. Normal capillary refill in the toes. Does any of this area hurt?
[patient]  Um, just kind of saw like an old bruise.
[doctor]  So I can feel that the knee is hot and that means there's something going on like some inflammation. So we can give you another steroid injection for that. I also want to get an x-ray of that knee so we can see where all the swelling is coming from.
[patient]  Yeah, let's do it. Sounds go to me.
[doctor]  Okay, and did we set up physical therapy for you last time you were here?
[patient]  Yeah, that was some years ago, but that was the other knee.
[doctor]  Okay, so I think we'll set that up for you now. We'll also do an X-ray on that knee. I can send you for physical therapy and if nothing is helping, then we really might need to get a surgery consult to see what we can do with that knee.
[patient]  Okay, sound like a plan.
[doctor]  Alright, so for today we'll go ahead and we'll give you the steroid shot. I'll try to see if I can get a little bit of fluid out before I do give you the injection. There might be no fluid, but I'll see if I can get anything out regardless.
[patient]  Okay, and that's a procedure you're going to do right now.
[doctor]  Yep. Once we're done talking here, and as far as the edema in your legs, we'll take an X-ray to look for the cause, but there is a lot you can do as well. The compression socks are a good start. And also, do you eat a lot of salt?
[patient]  I mean, I love my salty snacks.
[doctor]  Okay. Well, salt does have a tendency to make your body hold onto water. Reducing your salt intake could help with some of the swelling. You can also prop your feet up anytime you get a chance, especially at night. And have you talked to your private care doctor about this at all?
[patient]  No, I figure I would just come here first.
[doctor]  Okay, so I think try some of those things out first and if it doesn't help, definitely make an appointment with them. Also, as you know, Zelgens is a high-risk medication, so we need to check your CMP levels every couple of months. So this time your levels are good, but do make sure to make an appointment for the blood work for next time.
[patient]  Alright, I can do that. Thank you so much Doc.

Rheumatoid arthritis management.
The patient will continue Xeljanz XR 11 mg daily. He will also continue Celebrex 200 mg daily.

High-risk medication use.
The patient is currently on the high-risk medication Xeljanz. We will check his CMP levels and monitor periodically every couple of months.

Right knee pain.
He has right knee pain and swelling, with pain level 6/10. On exam today, the right knee continues to be hot, which is ongoing inflammation. We performed a fluid aspiration of the right knee today, see procedure note above. A steroid injection to the right knee was given today, see procedure note above. We will arrange for x-ray of the right knee and refer his to physical therapy.

Lower extremity pitting edema.
The patient notes whole right leg swelling since the last visit. He usually wears support hose, which helps to some degree. He has not seen his PCP. We discussed compression stockings, elevate feet, and a low salt diet. He will check with his PCP for further instructions."
virtscribe,D2N145,"[doctor]  Uh, MRN 49282721. Patient's name is Jacqueline Miller. Use last visit exam where appropriate.
[doctor]  Hi, how are you doing, Jacqueline?
[patient]  I'm pretty. Good. How are you?
[doctor]  good as well. So it sounds like we're under good control right now.
[patient]  Yes, it's doing much better.
[doctor]  Good good. Do you have any rash left over?
[patient]  Yeah, I have a small bit left over. I started using a doxocyclein only one a day because I think the pharmacist said if it's getting better to just limit it to once a day.
[doctor]  Okay, that sounds good.
[patient]  But I was taking it twice a day and I did notice a lot improvement.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  And then when I started doing it only once a day, it seems the same and it's not continuing to get better. So it's kind of plateaued a little bit.
[doctor]  I see. Um, are you breastfeeding at this time?
[patient]  No, I'm not right now.
[doctor]  Okay, good. So you, you should not be breastfeeding while you're on that medication.
[patient]  Yeah, actually I stopped breastfeeding and then asked for the docks of cycling at that time.
[doctor]  Okay, even with the doxocycline, you can keep using the ELide L.
[patient]  Okay, I didn't take the Eli Dell because when I read about it I got worried. So I wanted to just try the docks of Cyclean and see.
[doctor]  Okay, so we can talk about the Elydeal. A lot of the things you read about is not actually relevant to the cream or ointment form, but it's about the oral form that's used in really high doses long-term after people have a heart transplant or a kidney transplant or something like that.
[patient]  Okay, I didn't realize that.
[doctor]  Yeah, and when you suppress the immune system that hard for that long, it can predispose you for developing cancers like hematologic type cancers. It doesn't apply to as needed use of the medicine, a cream or an ointment, okay?
[patient]  Okay, then I can resume taking the docks of side clean twice a day again.
[doctor]  So let me clarify, what exactly are you using? And then we'll look at you and figure out, okay? So you're using the Sulphus et amide wash? Uh, how frequently are you using that one?
[patient]  twice a day.
[doctor]  Okay, and that's not drawing you out too much.
[patient]  No, that's fine.
[doctor]  Okay, and you're using the metro cream?
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  How often are you using that one?
[patient]  After my face wash, I immediately apply the cream.
[doctor]  Okay, and then are you using any other kind of lotions or anything?
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  So you're not using the cedarful cleanser?
[patient]  I'm not.
[doctor]  Okay. And no Neutrogeno wipes?
[patient]  No wipes.
[doctor]  Okay. And then what about any lotions you're using?
[patient]  I'm not using any lotion right now, just those two.
[doctor]  No lotion, okay. So that may be something else we should add in, a lotion to just help moisturize. But we'll see.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  And then again, when did you go down to just taking the doxocycline once a day?
[patient]  That was last week. So the first two weeks, I did twice a day.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  And then I started seeing improvement and then I changed to just once a day.
[doctor]  Okay, let me take a look at your face here. I'm going to describe for the transcriptionist what I'm seeing. Your Fitzpatrick skin type 4, meaning you're not going to burn, you're going to sun tan, essentially for the V. And then on bilateral medial cheeks, there are a few really faint erythematous papules and just maybe a little bit of redness around and underneath your nostrils. So you're right, it's not totally gone.
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  I think I would go ahead and go back to twice a day every day with the docks of Cyclean.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Uh, but I would pick up the Eli Delt too.
[patient]  Okay, I can do that.
[doctor]  I mean, out of known risks associated with medications, topicals are usually safer and preferable to oral medications. With that being said, the doxocycline is low risk.
[patient]  It is? Okay.
[doctor]  And doxocycline can give you bad upset stomach or heartburn. It will make you sunburn even if you never sunburn, so you have to protect yourself.
[patient]  Yeah, I mean, I feel sunsensitive whenever I go out. So, I'm taking all the precautions with wearing a hat and all of that.
[doctor]  Great! I just wanted to make sure you knew about that.
[patient]  Yes, I did. Thank you.
[doctor]  All right, but I think to help get rid of it sooner rather than later, if insurance will cover the E-Lide L, pick it up and start using it.
[patient]  Yeah, I did check. The insurance is not covering it.
[doctor]  It's not? Okay. Well, let's look around really quick, because if you use a Goudrex coupon, it will be around 30 to $40 or something.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Let's see.
[patient]  So with your coupon, it was around $850 or something.
[doctor]  Oh yeah, that's way too much.
[patient]  I agree. And because I also looked at the U-Kristo that you recommended in my notes, and if it's still ex, if it's still expensive, I could try that instead.
[doctor]  Yeah, so it actually, it is actually more expensive. I think the price is fluctuate.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Because now it's showing the cheapest of $70 and when I looked before it was around $30 to $40.
[patient]  Yeah, if it was around $200, I would have picked it up. But it was coming to around $850 after insurance.
[doctor]  Okay, so I've found the cream form. We could try ointment form.
[patient]  You mean the Taker Alimus?
[doctor]  Yeah, I'm in.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  So if we send it to Pick and Save or Metro Market, let's see where else.
[patient]  Can you do the metro market?
[doctor]  Yeah, let me put in the prescription and we'll see what we can find.
[patient]  Sure.
[doctor]  Pharmacy is what I'm trying to say.
[patient]  Okay, but it's not steroid, right?
[doctor]  Correct, it's not a steroid.
[patient]  Okay, good.
[doctor]  It's called a calcaneurin inhibitor. It's kind of like a steroid in that it calms inflammation.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  But it's not a steroid, so don't use steroids on your face for sure, as they'll make this kind of rash worse. But also, steroids carry the risk of causing thinning of the skin.
[patient]  All right.
[doctor]  These medications don't cause thinning of the skin, and they're not going to cause some other kind of rash. The thing to know is that sometimes 5-10 minutes after you put it on, it can cause this weird kind of tingly or needle-like sensation, or make it redder or flush. But it should only last a few seconds, and then go away. It's non-allurgy, or anything bad.
[patient]  Okay, got it.
[doctor]  So it only lasts a couple seconds. It doesn't mean it's going to happen again. It's nothing bad. It will still work, so keep using it as long as you know you can stand it, okay?
[patient]  Okay, thank you for explaining.
[doctor]  So I will say apply to rash on face twice daily until resolved.
[patient]  Okay, so only apply to the rash area.
[doctor]  Yes, and keep using the face wash.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  I think you could just do it once a day. I don't think you need to do it twice a day, just because I don't want to dry your sky out too much, okay?
[patient]  I never noticed that my face is dry or got thin. I feel so good after using it.
[doctor]  I understand, but it could get dry and I don't want to create other problems for you.
[patient]  Alright, I'll just wash once a day with it, but it was feeling very good, like there's this little bit of moisture getting back in. With the other wash, when I would use it twice a day, I was drying out. But not with this one.
[doctor]  I see. Okay. Well then do what feels good. If you do notice that you're starting to get dry, then reduce to once per day.
[patient]  That sounds good.
[doctor]  So, to review, continue using the same face wash, continue with metro cream, and increase the use of doxocycline to twice a day.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  and then just do it until it's gone and then do it for once a day for another week before stopping.
[patient]  Okay, sounds good.
[doctor]  All right, and I'll rewrite your instructions here.
[patient]  Thank you so much.
[doctor]  If there are any other questions or you're getting different instructions, feel free to reach out to me and we'll clarify. Okay?
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  But in general, doxocycline is such a low risk. We're not going to have you on this forever. But especially since we're adding the tachyrilitis, I expect it will clear quickly.
[patient]  Sound good.
[doctor]  Alright, and I just want to really help knock it out as fast as possible since you've been dealing with it for so long now. I would take it twice a day until it's gone and then once a day for a week before you stop. I'll write it out like that. So twice a day until rash is gone and then once a day for another week before stopping.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Once the rash stops, you can stop the tachyriline misoicment. Continue doxocycline another week, and then stop. But you can keep using the wash and the metro cream.
[patient]  Okay, that sounds good. I can do that.
[doctor]  And then hold off until I see you again before you start back any of your old products. If it's starting to flare again, if it's just a little bit, you can try just doing the tachyrolitis for a couple days to see if that's enough. If it's not, then restart the dy-docsocycline as well.
[patient]  All right.
[doctor]  I don't expect that to happen, but you know, if it does, you have the tools. Um, then you'll be seeing me for a follow-up. We can figure out what to do next. I would say if it's getting worse rather than better, just give me a call or send me a mycart message, okay?
[patient]  Yes, sounds good.
[doctor]  Do you have enough refills?
[patient]  Yeah, I think so.
[doctor]  Okay, so it looks like you have another refill of the doxocycline, so you're good there. Metro cream, you probably still have enough of that one.
[patient]  Yes, I do.
[doctor]  All right, and I'll cancel the E-Light L-cream just so we don't complicate your list. You have plenty of the face wash still.
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  Okay, and we'll get rid of the Clinton-Myson from your list as well.
[patient]  And what would you suggest for a moisturizer?
[doctor]  Yeah, so for that I would do something really basic like venecreme. Or even if it's just really dry, you could use a little bit of petroleum jelly. Um, I'll give you a couple samples, okay? Let's make sure we have a follow up in about four weeks.
[patient]  Okay, thank you.
[doctor]  Okay, and I would stay away from any kind of anti-aging thing, any kind of plant thing. Really, let's just be sure we talk about any new products or reach out to me if you're going to try something else. Let's go get those samples.
[patient]  Okay, that sounds good.
[doctor]  for assessment and plan, parallel dermatitis, rosacea, including ocular rosacea and copy and pasteor patient instructions. I recommend that she gently wash her eyelids once a day with gentle cleanser, such as vigny cream. Also use brooder mask as needed.","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Follow-up for perioral dermatitis.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Jacqueline Miller is a 40-year-old female who is being seen today for a follow-up skin exam for perioral dermatitis. She also has a history of rosacea, including ocular rosacea. Today, she states that her perioral dermatitis is well-controlled, although it has not fully resolved. The patient was applying doxycycline twice a day with improvement, but her pharmacist advised her to reduce to once daily since it had started to improve; therefore, for approximately the past week, she has been using the doxycycline only once per day. She has not seen continued improvement but it has not worsened. She is using the sulfacetamide wash twice daily, denies drying of the skin, and reports that her skin is much improved moisturization. She also applies MetroCream immediately after using the sulfacetamide wash. She denies using other lotions and products, Cetaphil lotion or soap, or Neutrogena wipes. The patient did not begin Elidel because it is not covered by her insurance, and she was concerned about possible side effects from the medication.

PAST HISTORY

Medical
Perioral dermatitis.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS

Doxycycline cream. Apply twice daily.
MetroCream. 
Sulfacetamide wash. Apply topically twice daily.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Integumentary
Skin inspection of the face was performed today. On bilateral medial cheeks, there are a few, very faint, erythematous papules with mild redness around and underneath the nostrils. Fitzpatrick skin type is 4 to 5.

ASSESSMENT

• Perioral dermatitis
• Rosacea, including ocular rosacea

Jacqueline Miller is a 40-year-old female who presented today for follow-up for her perioral dermatitis, which has improved but not resolved. She decreased her doxycycline per her pharmacist’s recommendation, which possibly stagnated the resolution of symptoms.

PLAN

Perioral dermatitis.
I counseled the patient about the risks and benefits of doxycycline and recommended she resume twice daily application until she reaches full resolution, and at that point she should reduce application to once a day for an additional week. The patient will not be using Elidel as I reviewed the cost of the medication and without insurance, it was too expensive. I provided a prescription for Tacrolimus and counseled her on possible side effects of using the medication. She will continue with Sulfacetamide face wash once a day. Also, use Bruder mask as needed.

Rosacea, including ocular rosacea.
Continue using MetroCream twice daily. I recommended to gently wash her eyelids once daily with a gentle cleanser and try a gentle cream such as Vanicream.

INSTRUCTIONS

Call the clinic if symptoms worsen. The patient will have a follow-up appointment in 4 weeks."
aci,D2N146,"[doctor]  Hey, good morning, Bobby. How are you?
[patient]  I'm doing okay. I as you're aware, Dr. Miller sent me over for this pain in my belly that I've had for several weeks. They did. He did an ultrasound and then said I had gallstones and they recommended I stay several away from some high fat food, but I'm just still having a lot of pain and he refer me to you.
[doctor]  Alright, well, I'm sorry to hear that you're having pain, but I am glad that he sent you over to see me. I want to talk a little bit more about that pain, can you describe the kind of pain that you feel?
[patient]  Well, it's on the right hand side of my belly. It's right underneath my ribs. And it feels like a squeezing severe pain it comes and goes, but when it comes, it's really severe. And I get kind of nauseated and sick in my stomach.
[doctor]  Okay, and then when you get that pain, can you rate that pain for me on a scale like zero being none 10 being the worst pain you've ever been in your life?
[patient]  When it's severe, it's probably innate.
[doctor]  Okay, all right, and then time-wise are we looking at can it just come and go any time? Or is it specifically around meal times? How does that pain kind of wax and wane for you?
[patient]  Most of the time, it comes right after I eat.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  but it also can come on a couple of hours after I eat also. So it's either immediately after I eat or a couple hours later, but it's related to eating.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  You know, I like to eat right.
[doctor]  Doe-way also, speaking of eating, let's talk a little bit about your diet. I see here on your chart that you're a type 2 diabetic. And it looked like that you were going to handle that with diet and exercise. Let's talk about that a little bit.
[patient]  Well, you know what my diet was worse when I before I was diagnosed with the Type 2 diabetes.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  And since then I've cut back on sugar and I started a little bit of a keto diet and I've lost about 25 pounds over the last three months.
[doctor]  Okay, so other than the weight loss, how how is your diet is that has that been working out for you? I mean, do you does, does that, does that fit your lifestyle pretty well?
[patient]  Yeah, it does it, I was surprised it wasn't as hard as I thought to go back and cut back and go more of a keto diet.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  But you know trying to cut out all those carbs my symptoms got better.
[doctor]  Yeah
[patient]  with the diabetes and my blood sugars are improving, but I still get that pain underneath the ribs.
[doctor]  Yeah, and that can happen. And one of those things that causes that is that those intake of that fatty foods, which is, you know, kind of the keystone or the hallmark of the keto diet, and have you noticed any improvement when you do cut out that fatty food, and has that been difficult since you are watching your carbon take.
[patient]  The fatty food, it is a little bit difficult, you know, I like those pork rinds and you know, I've had to kind of cut those out, they were a nice staple for me when I was on a keto diet, but I have cut out to those pork rinds because those are just so delicious and you know, I would say the little bit better, but I still get that pain.
[doctor]  Okay, and then do you have any family history of gallbladder disease?
[patient]  Yeah, but you know, you know, I knew those coming both my dad and my mother both had gallbladder disease and had to have their gallbladders off.
[doctor]  Okay, so both both your parents, your mom and your dad had your had their gallbladders taken out.
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  Okay, and then I want to talk a little bit about your activity level and your and if your exercising has this affected your ability to get out and exercise.
[patient]  Not really. I mean, I usually got to watch around meals, you know, but I've never been a big exercise right after eating anyhow. But you know, I'm so glad springs here because it gives me that opportunity to get back out. And you know, I love photography. I love nature photography and with the width of the woods, going from you know that dark barren look to coming alive with that green and then budding. I love to get out and take foot photographs there.
[doctor]  That's awesome to hear you, I'm my wife, and I like to go over and take nature hikes through the new park behind the rec center. That just opened up, have you ever been over there to do any any picture taken we've got a bunch of beautiful nature pictures that we took about a week ago?
[patient]  No, I haven't been there. I might have to try that out yet.
[doctor]  Jetzt awesome!
[patient]  I like to get down near the river that's where I like to catch especially around springtime.
[doctor]  That's great, you next time you come in maybe you can bring in some of your pictures that would be awesome to see.
[patient]  Okay cool.
[doctor]  So I'm just curious talking about your symptoms here. Have you had any fevers you mentioned something about nausea? But have you actually vomited from those symptoms?
[patient]  There's times when the pain is really bad for a couple of days I've had some what I would describe as low grade fevers. And yes, you're right, I have feel nauseated, but I haven't thrown up.
[doctor]  Okay, so if it's okay with you, I'm going to go ahead and do a quick physical exam. Your vital signs look good today. Blood pressure was 128 over 88 respiratory rate, was 16 your pulse rate was 68. You were 8 feb. Today, which is a good thing and your oxygen saturation on room air was 99% taking a listen to your heart. Here your heart is regular of rate and rhythm no. I don't hear any. Ack topic beats no clicks. Rubbs or murmurs noted listening to your lungs. Here they are clear and equal bilaterally to osculation. Now I'm going to go ahead and do an abdominal exam. I do note positive vowel sounds soft, non-distended abdomen. However, you are positive for some slight guarding there to the right upper quadrant, but I don't note any rebound tenderness. Now I'm going to press slightly here beneath your ribs on the right hand side. Now take a breath and does that hurt when I press.
[doctor]  So I see that you're guarded there. So I'm going to say that that it did hurt when I did hurt when I.
[patient]  Absolutely that hurts so much when you push right there.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  Sorry, I was just trying to capture my breath.
[doctor]  Okay, that's no problem. So you are positive for Murphy's signs, but I don't appreciate any peritoneal signs. So let's talk a little bit about your results that I reviewed before you came in today. So your abdominal ultrasound shows multiple gallstones present in the gallbladder, and I do appreciate some mild thickening. Now the common bile duct size is within normal limits at four. One millimeters now. Let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you. Okay. I do believe you have some mild colisostitis. With gallstones, I don't appreciate any frank obstruction, but it looks like your gallbladder is inflamed. And it looks like that's happened maybe over the last few weeks since you've been having those symptoms now, since you haven't had any improvement with dietary modifications, I am going to make the recommendation that we do remove your gallbladder. And I would like to perform a laparoscopic colisostectomy. Now what that means is I'll make a few small incisions and insert a scope with some of those instruments that's going to remove that gallbladder. Through one of those little bitty incisions now, the surgery is going to take about an hour to an hour and a half. And you'll probably spend the night in the hospital because we just want to monitor your post procedure to make sure everything is okay, you're still going to want to avoid those high fat foods after surgery and eat foods that are going to be high in fiber. Now do you have any questions about what our assessment and plan is for for this?
[patient]  No no questions today.
[doctor]  Okay, now the other thing.
[patient]  How soon can I how soon will I be able to get up and get moving back outside after the surgery?
[doctor]  So the good news is since it's a laparoscopic procedure, you're going to be back on your feet pretty quick now for the first 24 hours. I'm going to want you to take it pretty easy. But after a couple of days, if you feel like moving around on some solid ground, you know, we don't want you hiking or anything like that. But if you feel like moving around on some solid ground, you can get up and walk around within a day or two and then in about a week. Or so I'll see you again and then we'll release you to go get back out there in nature.
[patient]  Okay, thank you very much.
[doctor]  You're very welcome. The other thing I want to talk briefly about is now you're not your type two diabetes. I want you to follow up with your physician just to make sure that you're handling your diabetes, especially the fact that you're going to have surgery and those type of things. And we will just continue to monitor your diabetes as has been outlined by your your additional either your endocrinologist or your primary care provider I'm going to have the nurse come in and get some paperwork signed. And if you don't have any questions for me, I will see you next week. And we will get this gallbladder out.
[patient]  Well, thank you very much. I'm looking forward to it. I don't want any more of that pain so.
[doctor]  Alright that sounds good, we'll see you next week then.
[patient]  Okay, take care.
[doctor]  Yeah","CHIEF COMPLAINT

RESULTS

Abdominal ultrasound obtained at an outside facility is reviewed today. This demonstrates multiple gallstones present in the gallbladder. I do appreciate some mild thickening. The common bile duct size is within normal limits at 4.1 mm.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Mild cholecystitis with gallstones.
- Medical Reasoning: Based on the patient's symptoms, exam findings, and ultrasound, I do believe he has some mild cholecystitis with gallstones. I do not appreciate any frank obstruction, but it looks like his gallbladder is inflamed. This appears to have happened maybe over the last few weeks or since he has been symptomatic.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I had a thorough discussion with the patient concerning surgical treatment. The preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative courses of care were described and discussed. I explained the surgery will take approximately 1 to 1.5 hours, and he will probably spend the night in the hospital for post-procedure monitoring. We also discussed that he should avoid high fat foods after surgery and eat foods that are high in fiber. All questions were answered.
- Medical Treatment: Since he has not had any improvement with dietary modifications, I recommend a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. A mutually agreed upon surgical date has been scheduled for 1 week.

2. Type 2 diabetes.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient is currently managing his diabetes with diet and exercise.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I advised the patient he should refrain from hiking in the immediate postoperative period; however, he may return to walking outdoors on solid ground 1 week status post-surgery.
Medical Treatment: I recommended he follow up with his physician regarding his impending surgery. We will continue to monitor his diabetes as has been outlined by either his endocrinologist or his primary care provider.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me 1 week status post-surgery."
aci,D2N147,"[doctor]  Hi Matthew, how are you the medical assistant told me that you injured your shoulder?
[patient]  Hey, I'm hanging in there.
[doctor]  What happened?
[patient]  Yeah, so while when I was younger, I used to be a little bit more active with my friends with the playing.
[doctor]  Pick up football and so you know me being a little bit older now I thought I'll take back up with no problem while I did I tried and all the other guys were a little bit bigger than me so I got I got tackled a couple of times and adjust
[patient]  I kind of landed on my shoulder a little bit weird one time. And so like I got back into the game, I was okay. But ever since then, the past couple of days, it's just been, it's been really bothering me.
[doctor]  Okay alright, and so when exactly did this happen?
[patient]  Yeah I'd say maybe it was probably about last weekends, so I'd say about like four days ago.
[doctor]  Okay, well I'm happy at age 67 you're out there playing tackle football so good good for you and was it your right shoulder or your left shoulder that you injured?
[patient]  It was my right.
[doctor]  Okay, and are you right or left-handed?
[patient]  I'm right-handed.
[doctor]  Okay, and have you had any numbing or tingling in your fingers at all?
[patient]  No fingers have been okay.
[doctor]  Okay, and any problems with the strength of the arm at all, are you able to grab a cup of coffee?
[patient]  Yeah, I hands doing okay, I can grab. I'm just trying to avoid lifting anything, anything, anything, anything a little bit too heavy like I had a chipmint command. So I had a box in the driveway the other day and reaching down and picking up the box was a little tough.
[doctor]  Okay, and we're exactly on your shoulder does it hurt?
[patient]  It's cut on the on the backside, right right around here.
[doctor]  Thumbnaoth, okay, all right. And are you able to lift up your shoulder so that your shoulder touches your ear at all?
[patient]  Yeah, no, that's that's that's hurting a little bit.
[doctor]  Okay, all right. And what have you taken for the pain?
[patient]  Just a little bit of Tylenol, try and take it easy.
[doctor]  Did that help at all?
[patient]  It kind of like kept it at the same spot that has been, but it really didn't make it go down.
[doctor]  Okay, so are your symptoms any better since it happened or are they about the same?
[patient]  Know what they're about the same.
[doctor]  Okay, and any neck problems to do, injure your neck when this happened.
[patient]  No neck has been okay.
[doctor]  Okay, and any other joint problems like does your elbow hurt on that side or your wrist or is it just your shoulder?
[patient]  Nope, the rest of it's doing okay. It's just the shoulder.
[doctor]  Okay, and any other orthopedic injuries in the past have you ever injured that shoulder before as far as you know?
[patient]  Nope, nope, that one that one's been fine.
[doctor]  Okay, and any other surgeries or any other medical problems.
[patient]  I mean I had appendicitis, so I had an appendectomy.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  Maybe like three, four years ago, but that's about it.
[doctor]  Okay, all right, well, I'm just gonna go ahead and do a quick physical exam. I'm gonna be calling out my exam findings. I'll let you know what that means. So, and last thing, have you had any fever or chills since this happened at all?
[patient]  A slight headache, but no no no fever.
[doctor]  Okay, did you hit your head when you when this happened?
[patient]  A little bit.
[doctor]  Okay, all right, did you pass out?
[patient]  Nope, nope stayed conscious throughout.
[doctor]  Okay, all right, well looking at your vital signs here in the office, you don't have any fever your blood pressure looks quite good. It's about 122 over 76. Your heart rate is appropriate at 82 beats per minute and your oxygenation is 95% on room air on your cervical spine exam. There is no tenderness to palpation of the cervical spine. There is full range of motion on head exam. There does not appear to be any trauma. There is no echinemosis or bruising right shoulder exam on your musculoskeletal exam. There is pain to palpation of the posterior shoulder at the acromioclavicular joint. There is decreased abduction and adduction to about 90 degrees only there is there is a he is pain with supination and pronation of the right arm and there is a palpable radial radial artery pulse. Okay, so what does that mean that just means that you have some you know evidence of the injury there and we're going to talk about that. So I had the nurse do a shoulder x-ray on you before I came in the room and the results of your right shoulder x-ray show that you have an acute acromioclavicular joint fracture. So you just have a a small fracture of the acromion. I don't think that it's going to be anything that we need to do surgery for so let's just talk a little bit about my assessment and plan. So for your right shoulder injury for your acute acromioclavicular joint fracture, I want to go ahead and just put you in a sling for now. I want to go ahead and prescribe meloxicam 15 milligrams. Once a day, I want to go ahead and just order a cat scan of your right shoulder just to kind of get a better look of how the joint looks and we're going to go ahead and refer you to physical therapy to strengthen your shoulder in hopes of avoiding surgery in the future. How does that sound?
[patient]  Yeah, that sounds great. Just being able to take a little bit of something for the pain would would be really appreciated.
[doctor]  Okay do you think you need something stronger than Meloxicam?
[patient]  No give that shot.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  and see how that goes.
[doctor]  Okay, any questions?
[patient]  What can I get back out on the field?
[doctor]  While you can't play tagle football for a while you have to have this fracture healed.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  And I would avoid doing it, you know, as we get older, you know our bones get a little bit weaker. So I would avoid the tackle football, maybe flag football in the future, okay?
[patient]  Yeah, yeah, that sounds good.
[doctor]  Okay, anything else?
[patient]  Now I think that's been great. Thank you so much.
[doctor]  Okay you're welcome, have a good day bye.
[patient]  Thanks.","CHIEF COMPLAINT

aci,D2N148,"[doctor]  Hi Jeremy, how are you the medical assistant told me that you injured your back?
[patient]  Yeah, I was moving some boxes when my son was moving out of his college dorm, and I really hurt my lower back.
[doctor]  Okay, how long ago did that happen?
[patient]  This was about four months ago.
[doctor]  about four months ago, okay, that's quite a long time and you're just seeing me now for it.
[patient]  The appointments were backed up and I tried some point in my gym but it really didn't seem to help and I was really concerned.
[doctor]  Okay, and what exactly are your symptoms? Are you having pain when you're just sitting there or when you're moving around for a very short period of time it felt like I was going to tap over? I like I couldn't support my upper body weight and then my right toe or the toes on my right foot tingled a little bit, but that went away after about an hour. Okay, are you still getting that numbing and tingling periodically in your feet or is that completely gone?
[patient]  That's completely gone and it just happened when I first felt the tweak in my lower back. I felt that sensation, but I haven't since.
[doctor]  Okay, and how about any difficulty or weakness in your legs?
[patient]  Only if I'm carrying something heavy otherwise it seems relatively normal, but I feel the sensation so I'm a little nervous about carrying something heavy.
[doctor]  Okay, and are, and do you still have pain down there in your lower back if I turn a certain way? Or if I roll over in my sleep, I'll wake up from it from a like a sharp pain. But then that goes away if I position myself the right way, okay. And what have you been taking for the pain?
[patient]  I took some Tylenol, I took some ibuprofen, I've tried heat, I've tried ice and nothing really seems to help.
[doctor]  Okay, is the ibuprofen any better than the Tylenol?
[patient]  a little bit, but for sure a shorter period of time.
[doctor]  Okay and did you get any stomach upset from the ibuprofen?
[patient]  Now I try not to take too much, so I don't have an upset stomach from it.
[doctor]  Okay, and did you go to like an urgent care centang or an emergency room have you had any imaging on this at all?
[patient]  I went in urgent care and they wanted me to do a Mariah, but I was a little concerned because I think we maxed out our insurance. So I didn't do it because it started to feel better, but because it's been going on so long I'm a little bit concerned now. I do want to actually move forward with that.
[doctor]  Okay, all right, and any other symptoms, any problems with like your bladder or your bowels, any incontinence, or you know you feel like you can't go to the bathroom.
[patient]  Now I haven't had any of those issues.
[doctor]  Okay, all right. And any other, any other past medical history? Do you that you have any?
[patient]  I had knee surgery about two years ago on my right knee.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  That went fine. I rehabbed a point has been fine that it feels about 95% ever since.
[doctor]  Okay, and what did you have done to your right knee?
[patient]  It was a total knee replacement.
[doctor]  Okay, a total near replacement in 2018, is that what you said.
[patient]  No was actually about two years ago, so it's the spring of 2020.
[doctor]  Okay, all right, all right, well, I want to go ahead and just move on to a physical exam. I'm going to be calling out some of my exam findings.
[patient]  MM
[doctor]  Now you have you had any fever or chills with this.
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Okay, all right, all right. So looking at your vital signs here in the office, you know, they look really good to you. You don't have any temperature your blood pressure is good. It's about 117 over 56.
[patient]  MM
[doctor]  Your heart rate is nice and slow at 68 and your oxygenation is fine at 95% on room air so that means everything looks good.
[patient]  Good.
[doctor]  On your neck exam, I do appreciate some bony protuberance of the C5C6 do you have any pain when I touch here?
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  No okay on your lumber spine exam. I do appreciate you have pain when I touch here.
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Okay, so there is no pain to palpation of the lumbar spine, there is decreased flexion, and extension of the lower back the patient does have a positive straight leg raise, and there is some spasm of the paraspinal muscles of the lumbar spine on musculoskeletal exam, the lower extremities strength is equal bilaterally. So what does that mean Jeremy? That means that you have some, you know, maybe a some arthritis in your neck here, and or maybe. Just a little bit of some injury from from that from that. Back that back thing that you told me about.
[patient]  MM
[doctor]  Okay, but I think overall things look really good. So you know I had them do in Lumber Spine X-ray on you before I saw you. And I looked at the results of your Lumber Spine X-ray, which showed no acute bony abnormality. You know, there was no fracture of your back, or anything which is not surprising based on your history. So let's just talk a little bit about my assessment and plan. So I do believe it sounds like you have an acute disc. Herniation now, this did happen a few months ago, but it sounds like that's what you had based on the fact that you're still having symptoms.
[patient]  MM
[doctor]  I do want to go ahead and order a Lumber Spine MRI to get a better look at what's going on you know x-rays really just look at the bones they don't show us any of the soft tissue. So let's go ahead and order the Lumber Spine MRI. I want to continue with physical therapy. So I'm going to refer you to a physical therapist through our health system.
[patient]  MM
[doctor]  And then I also want to go ahead and prescribe Meloxicam 15 milligrams once a day.
[patient]  MM
[doctor]  to help with that, do you have any questions about that?
[patient]  No questions.
[doctor]  Now if you do have a herniated disc, we can go ahead and talk about some other treatment options, maybe like an epidural steroid injection to help take down some of that inflammation.
[patient]  MM
[doctor]  It might make you feel better, but we'll deal with that when we get there okay.
[patient]  Sure.
[doctor]  Any questions?
[patient]  Not at this point.
[doctor]  Okay, great thank you.
[patient]  Thank you.","HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

aci,D2N149,"[doctor]  So Dennis is a 57. Your old male today complaining of shortness of breath, he has also got a history of diabetes, high blood pressure and history of asthma. So Dennis tell me what's going on, how are you doing?

[doctor]  Couple of weeks tell me what's going on.
[patient]  I wake up with shortness of breath.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  I go to when I'm sure to breath there, I get back home, and I'm again sure to breath, so I had a tough time dealing with this.
[doctor]  Have you noticed any, are you coughing up anything and he's swelling in your legs? Or what's going on?
[patient]  Yeah, but I've been coughing up. I've been coughing up blood.
[doctor]  Okay, how long has that been going on for?
[patient]  probably three weeks or so.
[doctor]  Okay, and are you coughing a lot of blood? Or just a little bit of blood?
[patient]  I shave three to four cups a day.
[doctor]  While that's a lot of blood, okay are you throwing up any blood are you having bleeding in any place else or just when you cough?
[patient]  Only when I cough.
[doctor]  Okay, have you noticed any bruising or bleeding from your teeth or anything like that or from your gums or anything like that?
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Okay, any leg swelling or calf swelling or any anything like that any recent travel history you've been on a plane or trip recently?
[patient]  I had some knee problem, but there is no swelling, but it hurts that's been going on for quite some time.
[doctor]  Okay, so that's not near the knee problem, okay? And have you had any, have you been to the hospital or been to the emergency room? Or anything like that for your coughing and coughing up blood?
[patient]  Now I try to get an appointment in the office, but they were kind of booked up.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  They just know.
[doctor]  Alright, and alright, no, but no fever with this. So since you're here, your oxygen level looks pretty good in the clinic, it's about 94% on pulse, your pulse oxygenation, so that's good or you short a breath. So when you walk or you or you exert yourself, your short a breath, you said, right, okay, and have you. And how how is your blood sugar been doing since this has been going on? I know you're on metform and how's your diabetes been doing.
[patient]  Not so good, you know, kind of going up and down, I wear this dexcom.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  You know after meal they spike up while over 200.
[doctor]  Okay, and...
[patient]  And morning when I get up there around 150.
[doctor]  Okay, all right. So it's been running a little bit high. I know we checked your hemoglobin a1c last time and it was about seven. Seven. I think and we had talked about, you know, improving your diet and improving some exercise, but is this blood sugar been high and low or high in normal when you're especially in the last three weeks or has it been going on for longer than that?
[patient]  I would say about a month.
[doctor]  Okay, all right. And how is your blood pressure been at home since you've been taking since these episodes that you've been sick or you're taking norvask?
[patient]  Yes, I am, but I keep them on some days because my blood pressure has been running someone on the low side.
[doctor]  Okay, all right. And right now it's about 120 over 70, what how low does it go in the more when you check it?
[patient]  while there are sometimes in the lower 90s.
[doctor]  Okay, all right. Well, let me let me examine you here in a second. And we'll think about you know what we need to do, especially with your coughing and your shortness of breath. Okay. So, Neeta, I'm examining you now. Let's pretend I did my exam. I'm just going to verbalize some of my findings so I can put it into my chart. Okay. And I'll explain what those things mean. So on my exam, you've got no JVD. There is no swelling in your neck. No carotid. Brutes your lung exam. You've got some rails and some ronkyon. On more on the right side, I don't hear any wheezing right now. There is some diminished breath sounds on the right side. As well on your heart exam, you've got two over-successolic ejection murmur. You've had that in the past that's unchanged from before the rest regular rate. And rhythm otherwise your belly exam is nice and soft on your extremity exam. You've got one plus non-pitting edema on both of your lower extremities on your on your ankles. No calf tenderness. No negative home in sign. So what does all this mean? So basically, you've got, you know, you've got some sort of infection or something going on in your lungs that I can hear right now. The rest of your exam is pretty much stable. It's unchanged from before. So let's talk about what we should do about this. So for the first problem with the shortness of breath, the first thing I want to do is go ahead and get a chest x-ray for you. Okay. You've been coughing up blood. I also want to send you to the emergency department to get some blood testing done. I'm worried about a blood clot or something else going on. So I want to get a cat scan of your chest as well. So I'm going to go ahead and refer you to the emergency department. I'll call them and and have you head over that way. They can get a chest x-ray and a cat scan and some blood work as well. And then we'll evaluate why you're having the shortness of breath and why you're coughing up this blood. Okay. And then depending on what they find you, may need you know, it could be as simple as a pneumonia or it could be something a little bit more serious. We may have to get, you know, start, you know, depending on what you find, we will get the right treatment started any questions about that or can you drive to the emergency department from here or is that okay?
[patient]  Yeah, I can bike no problem. I have no question.
[doctor]  All right, for the second problem for the diabetes. Since your blood sugar is running a little bit high, once you get over this and blood sugars, running a little bit high once we get you over this hump of the shortness of breath and get this diagnosed, I'm going to go ahead and order another hemoglobin, A1c today. We will probably increase your dose of metformin from 500 twice a day to 750 twice a day. So why don't we do that? And then why don't we have, we'll have the hemoglobin A1c back. And then we can once you get over this illness that your undergoing will, we'll discuss that moral have you come back in about three weeks to just discuss your diabetes. And what our treatment plan will be for that okay.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  For the high blood pressure, definitely hold off on the norbask for right now. Let's figure out what's going, what's causing this episode of shortness of breath. I want some blood testing done. And once we have that under better control, we can reassess your blood pressure. So right now, hold the norbask, and then we'll have you come back once everything is done, okay?
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Any other questions or anything we know if we need to talk about today?
[patient]  No, I'm good.
[doctor]  Sounds good we'll get you signed out here in a second.","CHIEF COMPLAINT

aci,D2N150,"[doctor]  Alright Scott, so I understand that you had some right knee injury. Can you tell me a little bit about what happened?
[patient]  Yeah, we'll try to go out and play some pick up soccer games over the weekend and want to go to the ball and then just fell to pop in my right knee.
[doctor]  Okay, and how long ago did that happen?
[patient]  about three days ago.
[doctor]  Three days, okay. And when did you notice any swelling, anything like that?
[patient]  It is swollen, some of that swelling has gone down.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  But it mainly just it feels like that I just I can't my knee is just not as functionally it's not moving as well as what it used to be it seems to be a little limited.
[doctor]  Okay, all right, and then so how's the pain with your knee on a scale of one to 10-1 being the least pain, 10 being the worst pain house house has been ranging?
[patient]  It's somewhere between 6 and 7 right now. It's about 4 or 5 with some of the swelling going down.
[doctor]  Okay, all right. And did you take anything at all to relieve the pain?
[patient]  Anti-inflammatories.
[doctor]  Okay, already, and did that help.
[patient]  Yeah, the ibuprofen helped a little bit, but I'm on it pretty on a pretty regular basis right now.
[doctor]  Gotcha, okay. Now tell me are you able to bend or straighten your leg ever since then?
[patient]  I can bend it, but it hurts toward the end of the motion and I can straighten it, but it doesn't feel like I have to help get it straightened.
[doctor]  Okay, all right. And then how about you able to bear any weight on it or walk on it at all?
[patient]  I can still bear weight on it, but it feels just really loose and it doesn't feel normal.
[doctor]  Gotcha, okay. Alright, well let's go ahead and take a look at your knee here real quick before I take a look at your knee here. I'm going to do a physical exam. And in terms of your gate here, I did notice that you do have a marked limp on your looks like it's your right leg upon ambulation. So let me go ahead and take a look at that right knee real quick. I do appreciate some significant effusion in the right knee just a slight bit of echinosis. Just feel around here, Scott, how does that feel does? That hurt when I kind of press on that there.
[patient]  A little bit of pain there, not really bad, it feels like it's just more on the inside of my knee.
[doctor]  Yep, okay, so you definitely feeling some a little bit of pain to palpation at the medial joint line. Now I'm going to have you lie on your back and also I'm going to do some maneuvering here of your leg. I'm going to do a real quick test on you here, okay? All right, how does that feel?
[patient]  Just feels just feels loose it hurts when you pull it at the very end.
[doctor]  Okay, sorry about that. Alright, so you're definitely having some difficulty with some passive range of motion here, and you're lacking a few degrees of terminal extension to about 115 degrees, as well as lacking about maybe 20 to 30 degrees of terminal flexion on the secondary secondary to the pain here, and you do have a positive lockman exam. So one more thing I want to take a look at real quick, I'm going to take a look at your toes here real quick, very good, so neurovascularly. Your bilateral lower extremities are intact, and it looks like you have a muscle strength of a five out of five. So, Scott, you know, based on my examination here, your right knee injury is really suggestive of anterior cruciate ligamentaire, and you've heard of it probably even heard as ACL tear sometimes, especially when a lot of people do sports, and they injure their knee that that can happen, so my plan for you though, is I want I want to go ahead and order an MRI, because I want to evaluate the integrity of that ACL now. You may need surgery, but we'll first take a look at that MRI result and reevaluate and reevaluate that first, but in the meantime, I want to go ahead and order some anti-inflammatory medication, the locks of cam 50 milligrams a day, it's going to help reduce that swelling and the pain, and then I want you to go ahead and ice the knee if you need to, if you're still seeing some swelling and some pain you can go ahead and use ice as well, but I definitely would like for you to moderate your activities, so I would like for you to wear a knee immobilizer, and then also use crutches when you walk around just to help you a little bit, so not to put too much stress and strain on that knee does that sound like a plan.
[patient]  It does now. While I need to limit my work activities, I typically sit behind a desk, but it's not been very comfortable sitting here lately.
[doctor]  Yeah, definitely. So yes, so you can limit the activities for sure. In terms of your work activities, I know if you sit too long sometimes it can be painful because you do need to move that leg a little bit so it doesn't lock up. So I would like for you to do some slight activities not enough to stress your legs, but definitely move them a little bit every now and then so it doesn't lock up on you okay.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Alright, I do want you to, I know you are, I know you actually jog often. So, I want you to just slow that down for a bit, no jogging for a while, until we get you no results of your MRI, until we figure out what we, what we are going to be doing okay.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Alright, and how's your dog you hasn't been jogging with you before the incident?

Right knee injury.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Scott Miller is a pleasant 36-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of a right knee injury. The injury occurred 3 days ago, when he was playing pickup soccer games and felt a pop in his right knee. He reports swelling at the time of the injury, which has improved. The patient states that his knee is not as functional or moving as well as it used to be. He rates his pain level as a 6 to 7 out of 10 currently and a 4 to 5 out of 10 when the swelling decreases. The patient has been taking ibuprofen on a regular basis, which provides some relief. He states that he is able to bend his knee with pain towards the end of this motion; however, when he goes to straighten his knee, he feels like he has to help it straight. The patient adds that he is able to bear weight on his right knee, however it feels loose and does not feel normal.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient works at a desk.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports right knee pain.

PHYSICAL EXAM

GAIT: Marked limp in the right leg upon ambulation.
MSK: Examination of the right knee: Significant effusion. Slight ecchymosis. Pain with palpation at the medial joint line. Difficulty with passive ROM. Lacking a few degrees of terminal extension to 115 degrees. Lacking 20-30 degrees of terminal flexion secondary to pain. Positive Lachman's test. Muscle strength is 5/5. Neurovascular intact distally.

ASSESSMENT

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. I have recommended that we obtain an MRI of the right knee to evaluate the integrity of the ACL. I have prescribed the patient meloxicam 15 mg a day to reduce swelling and pain. We discussed that the patient should utilize ice and activity modification to reduce swelling and pain. I recommended that he wears a knee immobilizer and use crutches when he is ambulating. He will avoid jogging until we have the results of his MRI.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me once the MRI results are available for review and further discussion."
aci,D2N151,"[doctor]  Alright Teresa, I see here in your chart that you seem to be experiencing some elbow pain, could you tell me where it hurts?
[patient]  Yeah, so it's hurting on the inside of my elbow.
[doctor]  Hmm.
[patient]  And when I've been doing some pottery, I've been creating, you know, I have a pottery wheel and I've been I love my pottery and for my son's birthday. I've been making a ceramic bowl and I'm going to paint it And I have to do some real full decorations, but I've really been working on it a lot and my gosh, This is hurting and I can't work on it right now because it's hurting so much
[doctor]  I am so sorry. So I mean that's really cool that you do party. It's something that I've wanted to pick up you know, but I don't know that I have those skills yet. Does the pain radiate down your arm or up your shoulder or anything?
[patient]  It does down my arm and along that inside of my arm.
[doctor]  Okay, so the medial aspect, okay. Have you did you hit it on anything?
[patient]  No, not that I recall.
[doctor]  Okay, and have you ever injured your elbow before?
[patient]  No, I haven't.
[doctor]  Okay, alright, so on on a scale of 1 to 10 with 10 being your arm is actively being sought off by a chainsaw how bad is the pain.
[patient]  Well, I'd say it's about a seven.
[doctor]  Wow, that's pretty bad. Does it keep you up at night?
[patient]  Yes, it really does it to know if I roll over and it just wakes me up.
[doctor]  Okay, have you done anything to relieve the pain?
[patient]  while I've been taking some ibuprofen, but that isn't really helping.
[doctor]  Okay, and have you tried anything like ice or heat or anything else?
[patient]  I tried a little bit of ice at first.
[doctor]  Hmm.
[patient]  But, and it's just been hurting for about four days now.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  Didn't get better.
[doctor]  Okay, okay, so it's probably, it do you think it's getting worse?
[patient]  Well, it's just not getting better.
[doctor]  Okay, no, I understand. Okay. So I know that you also have like a history of hypertension and that we have you on 10 milligrams of lysinoprol have you been checking your blood pressures regularly.
[patient]  Yeah, you know what I remember too. I mean, they've been pretty good 1 teens to 1 30s.
[doctor]  Okay, all right. And okay, do you think that you've been good about taking your medications? Do you usually take them every day?
[patient]  Yeah, pretty much I.I. I you know said an alarm for that like centiprol.
[doctor]  Awesome, that's great alright. And so I see that you also we are treating you for diabetes as well and that we have you on 500 milligrams of metformin twice a day. How about that? Have you been taking that regularly?
[patient]  Well, sometimes I forget I mean having a medication twice a day. You know sometimes I'm out doing stuff and I just forget to take it.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  and plus I kind of have a sweet tooth. So you know sometimes they're a little bit higher, you know like 150 to 170 so.
[doctor]  Okay, alright, so when you say a sweet tooth, what are we talking about there?
[patient]  I love to buck also besides my ceramics. I'm really big and baking and I like to make cakes and then take them to you know parties and get together so you know family get together and I like to make center rules too I've been doing that since I was very young. So I kinda noticed that.
[doctor]  Okay, cinnamon rolls can be kind of hard like, do you for your cakes? Do you use fondant you know to like, do any of the decorations?
[patient]  No, I'm either just pretty basic, they're not overly fancy.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  Sipin' Rolls got that recipe out of a Southern Living magazine.
[doctor]  Ouf zu
[patient]  A long time ago and...
[doctor]  So you know it's good.
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  Alright, well, so I totally understand like baking and like the excitement of being able to give those to your family. But we maybe want to start cutting down on eating and taste testing ourselves. Is do you think that's something we could manage?
[patient]  Yeah, I know I need to get better on it. I probably could use maybe a refresher on just managing what I should and shouldn't eat how like if I need to combine a protein. You know if I do eat something a little bit sweet, maybe playing a protein or something with it.
[doctor]  BOOM! Yeah, that sounds like... hey.
[patient]  had some friends tell me something about that.
[doctor]  Yeah, that sounds like a great idea. And I think if that's something that we can maybe discuss to get you in contact with someone who can offer you someone with a degree that can offer you some really good advice. You know, I don't want to as much as it's really helpful to have friends. I do want to be able to give you like a source of truth, right?
[patient]  Yeah, I had a diabetic consult a long time ago, but it would be nice to see a dietician again and go over those. And maybe there's some new stuff too.
[doctor]  100% yeah, you know, like I one of the things that I struggle with is like our eggs good for you or bad for you You know like with cholesterol. I feel like it changes every other year or something like that So you're right there Maybe some pieces of information that we do need to update and and you know over a fresh of course wouldn't hurt But if you don't mind I'm gonna go ahead and start my physical exam I'm gonna call out my findings and just go let me know if you have any Questions or if anything sounds anything that you want me to expand on further But this is just for the recording sake so we can get everything documented okay
[patient]  Yeah, and can I ask you what word were my vital signs? Can you show me what my vital signs were?
[doctor]  Yeah, that's a really good question. So our big and favorite one is going to be your blood pressure, right? So you're right, like we are seeing some definite improvement today. It was 120 over 70 and honestly, that's a great place to be. So that tells me that your medication is working and that maybe we can start to evaluate a bit more your respiratory rate is completely normal. So I see it here as 18. That's wonderful, you are not running a fever so 97. 9. You're honestly, that's within like a good enough range for me, you're sadding pretty well your oxygen saturation is 100% again. So that means that you're not experiencing any kind of difficulty getting in that oxygen to the rest of your body. I do want to say that you know pain is one of the vitals that we worry about. And you're saying that at its worst you're the pain in your elbow is a 7 out of 10. So that's something that I'm going to evaluate and then your pulse rate seems to be appropriate as well. So those are all great. Do you have any questions about that so far?
[patient]  Now that sounds good, yeah, I was just curious.
[doctor]  Yeah
[patient]  Check it in a while so.
[doctor]  I do want to say that like looking at you're the weight we do see like maybe a five pound increase from the last time that you were here But that's completely normal right to be able like to fluctuate you know give or take five pounds So I'm not I'm not I'm not like seriously worried about it But if we do come back and notice an additional five pounds then we might have to start talking about like actually You know what let's do that right now what kind of exercise regimen are you on?
[patient]  While I do go for some walks in the evening, I try to get one in on the morning too.
[doctor]  Hmm.
[patient]  So not a whole lot other than that because I'm busy with my pottery or baking, so, but I do try to get out and walk daily.
[doctor]  Okay, that's awesome, so like how about about how long are your walks?
[patient]  while I just walk around the neighborhood. There's, you know, the sidewalks. And there's kind of a little bit more of a nature type area that goes across the bridge. And so it's probably, you know, maybe one to two miles a day.
[doctor]  While that's intense, I was not expecting that number. That's awesome. Okay. All right. So maybe this five pounds is muscle. We're going to go for it. Okay. But thank you. But that's some really important information. But I'm going to start your physical exam now. Okay.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Alright, so I know that you said that you are experiencing elbow pain. Could you tell me is it your left or your right elbow?
[patient]  It's my ride.
[doctor]  Okay, alright, right elbow. When I touch it, does it hurt on the inside?
[patient]  Yes, it does.
[doctor]  Okay, so moderate tenderness at the medial epicondyle when you turn like when you turn your wrist is if you're trying to open a door knob do you experience pain.
[patient]  No, not really.
[doctor]  Alright, so turning out no pain, but when you turn your wrist inwards do you have any pain?
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  Okay, so pain with resisted pronation of right form. When you rest your arm on a table with the palm side up, all right, I want you to raise your hand by bending the wrist to experiencing any pain.
[patient]  Yeah, that hurts.
[doctor]  Alright alright so when you are when I'm pressing here and like flexing your wrist are you experiencing any pain?
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  Alright, pain with flexion. And when bending the wrist, alright, when I listen to you, you know I'm just going to check your heart and lungs. Everything sounds good. No murmur, no rub, no gallop, your lungs are clear bilaterally to bilaterally to osculation. I'm not noticing any rash for your Eurolbo. I don't notice any bruising, any swelling. We do want to note that tenderness, but otherwise there is no discoloration, no lesion. So that's good, you're pulses and are equal bilaterally. And I think I think we have an idea of what we're dealing with here. Okay, so I'm going to go ahead and give you my impression and plan for your first problem, like your primary problem that you are here for is right elbow pain. It's consistent with medial epicondylitis and that it just means it's pain caused from overuse and damage to the tendons in your arm. What we are going to do is rest it. I'm going to order a sling for your right arm and you can wear this while you're awake. Well, I want you to apply ice to your elbow for 20 minutes, three times a day. I'm going to ask you to take 600 milligrams of ibuprofen that's three pills every six hours with food and you can take that for one week. I know it's really important that you said that you have something that a gift that you want to make for your son, but we're going to hold off on pottery for the next couple of weeks just to give your arm a chance to heal, you know, like it's awesome that you want to be able to do these things for your family. But sometimes you know your body is not where you're where your where your heart is like where your heart and your head are right and then so.
[patient]  I'll just let him know that I maybe I'll take a picture of what I have so far.
[doctor]  Absolutely, that's awesome. And so it'll be like a a movie like coming soon to a shelf near you That's great for your second problem right? We have this long standing diabetes. I want to increase your metformin to a thousand milligrams twice a day I know that you're saying you're having a hard time keeping up with that So I want you to do a good job of like checking and recording your blood sugars every day I do need you to follow up with me in a couple weeks. I also want to order something called in a one-se since you are having a hard time with like the blood like the blood sugars every day and a one-se will give me a more accurate picture of like a longer period of time And then we might need to evaluate like what are what other options that we have if your sugars if we can't get them a bit more under control I do want you to follow up with me in a couple of weeks about the about your diabetes and for your third problem of hypertension We're just going to continue you on your lysinopril at 10 milligrams that's it seems to be doing its job. I'm really I'm really glad about that And it's probably due to the walking that you're doing. I forgot to mention for your diabetes We are going to recommend AA referral to diabetic counseling that way you can get like a bit more information on like the steps that you can take to help you with that
[patient]  I was going to ask you how about my x-ray, the x-ray of my elbow. How did that look?
[doctor]  Your x-ray honestly looks great in that I don't see any kind of fracture or bony abnormality. So that's what makes me think that this is like a tendon related thing, right? So in reviewing your x-ray like it, it does support the the assessment and plan that I have given you
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  D.U.
[patient]  Just true.
[doctor]  Yeah, absolutely I do think for your primary problem, the elbow, that we might want to get put you in some physical rehab if the problem is taking a little longer to heal, but we'll discuss that at your next visit here, okay?
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  All right, no problem, any other questions.
[patient]  Nope.
[doctor]  Alright, thank you for keeping me accountable.","CHIEF COMPLAINT

aci,D2N152,"[doctor]  Good morning Noah, tell me a little bit about why you are here today.
[patient]  Hi document, I'm just had you know the back pain you know and I've I've had it for you know about a week and
[doctor]  Oh
[patient]  You know what I mean? I tried to, you know, I mean medications, but you know some over the counter stuff, but it doesn't go away.
[doctor]  Okay, can you tell me a little bit more about it? How did it start or how did it do you remember injuring yourself?
[patient]  No, not really. I mean, I was just like, you know, I guess I one day. I mean, I just twisted, you know, on my left. And maybe I mean, I might have picked something up.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  So I mean at that time, I mean there was this pain, but I you know it went away, you know, and I thought that was You know that was you know the end of it, but you know, I mean after you know a few hours, you know, it's a kind of came back
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  It's been there since then you know.
[doctor]  Okay, and is it anywhere in specific? Is it in the middle of the back across the whole low back or on one side or the other?
[patient]  I think it's more towards you know right in the middle maybe on the lower side and nothing on the you know I mean it's sometimes it goes back you know maybe having troubles with the left I suppose but I mean It's aggravated you know when I you know when I do some you know Maybe I'm a sudden movement to the left
[doctor]  Okay, and that's when you get the pain more, maybe located in the center, but it goes across to the little back and eye on the left side. And I also heard you say, you know, if you twist suddenly, that makes it worse, is that correct.
[patient]  It makes it worse, it makes it worse on media.
[doctor]  Now you know I was looking at your records and I know you have that history of diabetes and I haven't seen you a while for follow up for that how you've been feeling.
[patient]  I mean, been okay. I mean, I take my meds.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  And I try to still have sugar, but you know what I mean? I, you know, I mean whenever I get the chance, I mean, I, you know, I exercise, but you know what I mean? That's about it.
[doctor]  Okay, so you're on.
[patient]  MM
[doctor]  Yeah, I think I think you're all that met formin twice a day.
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  Yeah, okay.
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  Do you test your blood sugar at home in the mornings?
[patient]  Yeah, I mean I try to.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  Most of the morning, but sometimes I mean I go skiing, yeah.
[doctor]  And how have those numbers been?
[patient]  They bump towards me and bit towards the higher side. I mean, I must have been.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  You know but.
[doctor]  Well if...
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  Yeah, if I remember, write your family, don't they own that that bakery down on the corner of Main Street. And didn't they own that?
[patient]  Yeah, thank you.
[doctor]  And how do you stay away from those I got to be honest? I love, I love the cakes and donuts they make those are delicious.
[patient]  Yeah, I try to.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  But I mean, you know, they, they, you know, I have to visit them. And you know, I end up, you know, I mean getting some stuff, but it's not that much.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  Let's try to contain it, you know.
[doctor]  Well, let me sew. We're going to have to watch that and I'll come back and we'll talk a little bit about the diabetes. But let's go ahead and do that. I don't want to do a quick physical exam on you. I'm going to look in your eyes here. And so let me quickly look in your ears.
[patient]  I see.
[doctor]  Okay, that looks good. And any, let me listen to your lungs. Okay, your lungs are clear. And your heart, it's a regular rate. And rhythm, that's all good as we go through that. Now I want you to sit up here. I'm gonna press down your back starting at the top. And any pain up top, no.
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Okay, and then once I get down here and around that low back, I want to press in the center first as that cause you a lot of pain.
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  Yeah, okay.
[patient]  Yeah, that's the spot.
[doctor]  Okay, and if I come over here to the right now.
[patient]  Not that much you know.
[doctor]  Okay, so and then on the left hand side if I push down here kind of into your butt.
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  Yeah, okay.
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  Lay back on the stretcher for me for a second. I'm going to go ahead and lift your legs for me or I'm going to go ahead and lift your legs for you. Just relax. I'm going to start here on the right side when I lift that right leg up. Does that cause you significant pain or any pain at all?
[patient]  a little bit.
[doctor]  Okay, let me come around, let me lift up the left side. If I lift that up, does that cause?
[patient]  Yeah, you're dead, that's...
[doctor]  Yeah
[patient]  Still get tender, yeah.
[doctor]  I can see that grits on your face, so okay, that's good. And you know as I look at your lower extremities, there's no pain or numbness or tingling in your feet, or anything like that.
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Okay, okay, so let me talk a little bit about my impression and plan. So for that low back pain, I believe you have a musculoskeletal low back strain. I'm going to order a low back x-ray. So we'll order that and get that done as an outpatient. I don't expect to see anything significant, but it's going to tell me how those joint spaces look. And if you know if we're dealing with any disc issue, but that will be the start of it. And I'm also going to order some physical therapy too for two reasons to help with a little bit with the pain, but also strengthen some of the muscles there in the back. So those are the two things that we are going to do now. I want you to take take 400 milligrams of ibuprofen. You can take that occasionally with some Tylenol. When the pain gets more severe up to about three times a day, I'm going to also give you a prescription for some flexoril that's a muscle relaxant. And I want you to take one of those once a day every evening. But be careful if you're doing any strenuous or hazardous activities, such as driving after you take those now for your diabetes. My impression is that your diabetes is as under control. I noticed that we don't have in had a one C for almost five months. So I'm also going to order an A1C so we can find out where we are with that continue with your diet and exercise. We know that's really important. And then continue with your metformin. I'm not going to make any changes today, but we'll go ahead and look at that once I get that results of that A1C to you. Have any questions for me.
[patient]  yet can i still go to the bakery
[doctor]  I would yes, it's nice for you to go to the bakery, but you can't have any donuts. I'm no I you just really need to watch that intake of anything that you might get at the at the bakery. So just be careful with those carbohydrates, those sweets that you're taking as we go through your day. It's occasional occasional one perfectly fine, but on a routine basis, we need to watch that.
[patient]  Right, and how soon should I know check my blood sugars? I mean, what's good you know?
[doctor]  Yeah, that's a great question. I'm really glad you asked that I would prefer that you're taking your blood pressure. Every morning, the first thing you get up when you get up in the morning, that's going to give me a good idea. And so if you can do that the first thing in the morning and keep a record of it, you know, I know your glucometer keeps a record of it, but if you can write them down. And once we get that, a one-see that's going to give me a little more guidance. On how to deal with your blood, your diabetes.
[patient]  Why do you think what I need to see, you know, a pain doctor or, you know,
[doctor]  Not yet, let's get that that's a great question. I'm end up referring you to a pain doctor for that low back pain, but I really would like to start with some of the diagnostics first. Let's get an x-ray. And if there is, you know any question of that x-ray. And the pain continues. I'm going to go ahead and maybe order a cat scan. And then at that point in time, we can refer you to a pain doctor if we're still having significant pain.
[patient]  Sounds good.
[doctor]  Okay, thank you. I'm going to send my nursing to see you and we'll get you out the door.
[patient]  Thank you.
[doctor]  Take care.
[patient]  That one is a follow up mm.","CHIEF COMPLAINT

- Medical Treatment: Low back x-ray ordered. Referral to physical therapy provided. He will take 400 mg of ibuprofen up to 3 times per day. Tylenol can be used for severe pain. Prescription for Flexeril also provided.

2. Diabetes.
- Medical Reasoning: His diabetes is currently under control.
- Patient Education and Counseling: We discussed the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle. I encouraged him to try an avoid foods high in sugar. He asked many questions and I feel he is confident in the plan at this point.
- Medical Treatment: Hemoglobin A1c ordered as he has not had an updated one in almost 5 months. He will continue with his diet and exercise. Continue current dose of metformin for the time being. The patient will be checking his blood sugar in the morning and will log this information for me.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

aci,D2N153,"[patient]  I hope I didn't hurt it again.
[doctor]  Hi Gregory, how are you? I the medical assistant told me that you injured your knee.
[patient]  Yeah, I heard it stepping off a curb.
[doctor]  How long ago did that happen?
[patient]  about two and a half weeks ago.
[doctor]  two and a half weeks ago and what what knee is bothering you.
[patient]  The right knee, the outside of my right knee.
[doctor]  the outside of your right knee.
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  Okay, and did you actually fall down when this happened or?
[patient]  Now I just sort of turn over my ankle.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  to the outside and I thought my ankle was the thing that was in a hurt most but after the ankle soreness went away the only my knee hurt and it sort of clicks when I walk
[doctor]  And no, okay. So now it clicks when you walk. Okay, does it hurt when you walk?
[patient]  No unless I stand on one foot for an extended period of time, like leaning my foot up against the wall.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  Then I feel like it's locked, and then I sort of have to ease into walking again.
[doctor]  Okay, and what have you taken for the paint?
[patient]  Really nothing.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  I'd be profan, but I'm not a big pill taker, so I sort of sucked it up and...
[doctor]  Does the ibuprofen work?
[patient]  At night, you know, during the day, I'm more active. So it really doesn't impact it, because I just work through it. But at night, it does help me to settle down and sleep better.
[doctor]  Does your knee hurt when you're just resting and sitting there?
[patient]  No, once up it's fine when it's down on the floor with my foot flat. It's fine. It does hurt when I rest it on my heel.
[doctor]  Okay, and are you able to do things like bending or things like that?
[patient]  A full squat, that's when I feel the most clicking like. If I go all the way down to a full squat like a catcher that's when I feel the most clicking, but otherwise no, there's no pain, it's just the clicking, and I'm fearful that that's an injury of some type.
[doctor]  Okay, alright now you said squats or you are you active or you doing like burpees going to?
[patient]  Now I ride the bike.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  I ride the bike, I ride the bike, which I'm not doing now pellet and inside for the winter. I do have a winter bike though.
[doctor]  Okay, all right, well, I have a peloton who is your favorite instructor.
[patient]  I actually don't have a favorite instructor, I have more favorite rides.
[doctor]  Okay, what kind of rides do you like?
[patient]  I like rock music and regain music rides, so whoever is doing those in a began or a medium content I'm cool with.
[doctor]  I can't picture you as a Reggade person, so that's interesting to know okay. All right, and any numbing or tingling in your foot at all.
[patient]  Yes, but not from any injury, I broke my foot my second toe on my right foot, and I have numbness depending upon the shoe I wear.
[doctor]  Okay, when did you break your toe?
[patient]  I've broken it three times over the last ten years, so it's just something that's an annoyance, but it wasn't caused by this injury.
[doctor]  Okay, so you do have some numbing and tingling, but it's not new.
[patient]  Right, correct.
[doctor]  Alright, alright, well let's just go ahead and I'm going to go ahead and do a quick physical exam. I'm going to be calling out my exam findings. I'll let you know what that means. So on your musculoskeletal exam on your right knee, I do appreciate some slight edema. You do have a slight effusion. Does it hurt when I press on the outside of your knee?
[patient]  No, not physically.
[doctor]  Okay, there is no pain to palpation of the right lateral knee. I'm going to be bending your knee in all sorts of positions. Does that hurt?
[patient]  only when you pull it to the outside.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  From my my foot, when you pull it to the outside that the only time it hurts.
[doctor]  Okay, the patient has a positive aeroist test. There's full range of motion. There is a negative lockman sign. The patient does on cardiovascular exam. The patient does have a palpable door salis pedis and posterior to be allis pulse. Okay. Well, let's just I want to talk a little bit about I had the nurse do an x-ray on you. And I looked at the results of your knee x-ray. And it doesn't show any acute fracture or bony abnormality, which is not surprising based on your injury. So let's just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and my plan for you. So I think you do have a lateral a lateral collateral ligament strain based on your exam findings. And this this type of injury essentially can be healed by itself. You know, I don't think we're going to need to refer you to surgery or anything like that. I want you to go ahead and I'm going to prescribe maloxicam 15 milligrams once a day. I do want to go ahead and refer you to physical therapy because if we strengthen up those muscles and areas around that injury, then that will make your knee stronger. It help prevent future injuries. Are you able to ice it at all during the day? Now you said you're working you work in sales, so you said you're home.
[patient]  Yeah, I actually am a home, so I can ice it and I have been icing it.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  I mean, 20 on 20 off at least four times a day.
[doctor]  Okay, and so does that help at all.
[patient]  It makes it feel better in the morning when I first go to my desk. And at the end of the day before bed, you know, I take ibuprofen, so I don't have swelling overnight, but honestly, I have a pretty decent threshold for pain. So it's not good, it's not changing it by much.
[doctor]  Okay, do you feel like your symptoms are getting worse or better? I think I think pretty much for the last two weeks they've remained about the same, that the only time I feel like they get worse is when I exert myself doing up and down like gardening in the yard or moving pots.
[patient]  and stuff outside that the only time I felt like it got any worse, but nothing to the point where it stayed worse.
[doctor]  Okay, all right, well, let's go ahead and refer you to physical therapy. If you're still having pain, then we might have to consider an MRI.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Any questions about that?
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Okay, alright well it was very nice seeing you today call me if you need anything.
[patient]  I will.
[doctor]  Okay, bye.
[patient]  Bye.","HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Gregory Price is a pleasant 68-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of a right knee injury. The onset of his pain began 2.5 weeks ago, when he stepped off of a curb and turned over his ankle. He locates his pain to the lateral aspect of his right knee. The patient also reports clicking with ambulation. He denies any pain with ambulation unless he stands on one foot for an extended period of time. The patient also reports locking of his knee with prolonged standing. He notices pain when he is resting his foot on his heel. He denies any pain at rest and elevated, or when his foot is flat on the ground. The patient states that he is more active during the day, which does not impact his knee pain. He adds that he is able to perform a full squat without pain. The patient reports numbness and tingling in his right foot, however this is not new. The patient has been taking ibuprofen, which provides him with relief at night. He has also been icing his knee 4 times per day, which provides him with relief in the morning and at the end of the day.

MEDICAL HISTORY

He states that he has fractured his 2nd toe 3 times over the last 10 years.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient works in sales. He rides a bike for exercise.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Neurological: Positive for numbness and tingling in his toes on his right foot from prior injury.

PHYSICAL EXAM

CV: >Palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulse.
MSK: Examination of the right knee: Slight edema. Slight effusion. No pain with palpation of the right lateral knee. Positive varus test. Full ROM. Negative Lachman's.

RESULTS

4 views of the right knee were taken. These reveal no evidence of any fractures, dislocations, or bony abnormality. No other abnormalities are noted.

ASSESSMENT

Right knee lateral collateral ligament strain.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. I have explained to him that his x-rays did not reveal any acute fractures or bony abnormality. I have recommended that we treat the patient conservatively with formal physical therapy to strengthen his right knee. I have also prescribed the patient meloxicam 15 mg to treat his pain. If his pain does not improve with physical therapy, I will recommend obtaining an MRI.

aci,D2N154,"[doctor]  Hi Dennis, how are you today?
[patient]  Good.
[doctor]  So, what brings you into the office? I don't believe. I have ever seen you before here.
[patient]  I'm training for triathlon and the back of my heel hurts typically after a workout or when I first get up in the morning it will really hurt in the back of my heel all the way up into my calf.
[doctor]  Okay now tell me a little bit about this triathlon training. What are you or you running far? Are you tell me kind of how you work out for that today?
[patient]  I will run about 10 kilometers.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  In the morning at lunchtime, I try to get on the bike for about 45 minutes to an hour.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  And then in the evening I go to the Aquatic Center and I jump in the pool and swim for about another 30 minutes to an hour.
[doctor]  While that's an aggressive campaign to get there, so really hope you get that triathlon, and so how many days a week does this occur that you're training?
[patient]  I do that five days a week on the weekends. I kind of alternate between you know a long run and a long bike don't really do a long swim but...
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  I just swimming on those other five days and I take one day off.
[doctor]  OK, on your running days or when you do the running, tell me a little bit about your stretching routine. Do you or you aggressive stretchers? You do not stretch at all. I know people that do both.
[patient]  Yeah, I don't stretch at all. I don't have time for that.
[doctor]  Okay, and I'm assuming that with a bicycle either you don't really work the lower legs to get them stretched out you just jump on and go correct.
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  Yeah, you know what, when I first start off, I go slow until I'm warmed up and then I.
[doctor]  Okay, tell me a little bit about the pain as you said it it's after the activity, but you when you first wake up in the morning it sits there also.
[patient]  When I first get out of bed, it just feels really tight and almost like it's tearing. I after I've been walking around for about 10 or 15 minutes, it eases up a little bit. But if I ever sit down for any extended period of time and then try to get back up, it's really sore again.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  or
[doctor]  No go ahead go ahead.
[patient]  After a lot of activity, it'll get sore too.
[doctor]  Okay, okay. I'm sure this is impacting that ability to really focus on your training as you're going with that with that type of a pain. So let me go ahead and let's take a look at your your and your lower extremities here and yeah, okay, so roll up your pants. Yeah. Okay, good. Now does your left leg hurt at all? Do you get that severe pain or is it mainly on the right?
[patient]  No, it's mainly just on the right.
[doctor]  Okay, so I'm going to just hold your leg here and I want you to take your foot and ankle and I want you to go ahead and just pull your toes up towards you does that create some pain when you do that.
[patient]  Yeah, a little bit.
[doctor]  A little bit okay, now I'm just gonna hold your foot up and I want you to push against me. And does that hurt?
[patient]  Yeah, that hurts a little bit too.
[doctor]  Yeah, okay, okay, roll over here on my my stretcher for me and I want you to dangle your your feet over the edge And what I want to do is I just want I'm gonna squeeze your left calf first and when I do that does that hurt on your left side
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  and I'm going to squeeze on the right side anything there.
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Okay, okay, well that's good to do your Thompson test is negative that's a really good finding and I just want to continue pressing here on your right from your heel when I squeeze your heel does that cause significant pain at all.
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  Yeah, okay. And if I come up a little bit further as I run up that Achilles tendon does that hurt?
[patient]  That's real tender.
[doctor]  Yeah, okay, okay. Great, not great. So, yeah, go ahead and sit up for me. So, Dennis, my diagnosis is Achilles tendonitis. And it's really from overuse when we see this frequently. When somebody starts to you know, get in and train aggressively. For an event I'm unfortunately, I'm going to have to ask you to stop training for AA week or two I know that's concerning. But I really want this to heal before we move into that next phase. I didn't ask you about medication, but I'm assuming whatever you were doing wasn't working significantly. So, what I'd like you to do is take some ibuprofen or advelle that's the same medication. And I want you to take three tablets every six hours. And that's really an anti-inflammatory. See, if we can eliminate some of that tendonitis type pain that you're getting that inflammation around that Achilles tendon, I'm going to also order a couple physical therapy visits. And the reason for that is I'd like you to get some strength and stretching understanding. I think it's important for you, especially here at the beginning is to get some of that Rayal stretching knowledge in and learn how to stretch those muscles before you start these activities. And they're going to help strengthen your lower extremities also. And I want you to come back to me within you know a week to 10 days following your first couple physical therapy appointments. So I can monitor how you're doing. I see no reason for an x-ray at this point, but if this continues, we're going to you know if you're still having pain 10 days and significant pain without change modification of your activity. Then we may have to look at more aggressive treatment plans. How does that sound for you?
[patient]  Sounds good.
[doctor]  Okay, hey did you happen to catch that Pittsburgh ping one hockey game last night?
[patient]  No, I was watching the track meet.
[doctor]  My gosh, the the paying ones are on fire, you know they beat up on New York 7-2. I mean the hockey is just an amazing sport. I just do guide you do a lot of hockey down there in town here.
[patient]  used to when I lived in Detroit.
[doctor]  Oh
[patient]  Hockey town, but not so much anymore.
[doctor]  No yet a troid is a hockey town yet the red wings okay well i'm gonna go ahead and i'll send my nurse in and go ahead and get you discharged and like i said i'd like to see you back here in seven to ten days after that first physical therapy appointment i've got a great phenomenal office staff you just call in once they get scheduled they will get you into that next available appointment so take care and i will talk to you later
[patient]  Thanks.","HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Dennis Martin is a pleasant 46-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right heel pain. The onset of his pain began 10 days ago while training for a triathlon. He locates his pain to the posterior aspect of his heel, which radiates proximally into his calf. His pain is aggravated by working out and when he first gets up in the morning. If he sits for a long period, his pain will return upon standing. The patient states that he runs 10 kilometers in the morning. At lunchtime, he tries to get on a bike for about 45 minutes to an hour. In the evening, he goes to the aquatic center and swims for 30 minutes to 1 hour. The patient states that he runs 5 days per week. He adds that he alternates between a long run and a long bike ride on weekends. He currently takes one day off from his exercises. The patient states that he does not stretch at all. He denies any left leg pain.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports right heel pain. Denies left leg pain.

PHYSICAL EXAM

MSK: Examination of the right heel: Pain with resisted extension. Mild pain with flexion. Positive calcaneal squeeze test. Severe tenderness to the Achilles tendon. Thompson test is negative, bilaterally.

RESULTS

No new imaging was obtained today

ASSESSMENT

Right Achilles tendinitis.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination today, I had a lengthy discussion with the patient regarding his current symptoms. I have explained to him that his symptoms are likely secondary to overuse. I have recommended that we treat the patient conservatively. The patient was instructed to take at least 1 week off from his training to recover from this. I will provide him with a referral for formal physical therapy to strengthen his right lower extremities. I have advised him to take 3 tablets of ibuprofen every 6 hours for pain. If his pain does not improve with physical therapy, I will recommend obtaining an x-ray.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me in 7 to 10 days to check on his progress."
aci,D2N155,"[doctor]  So hey Christina, good to see you today. I see you're here. You have a non-healing footser. Well, also looks like in my notes that you got some you've got type 2 diabetes and that probably the reason for your ear, but also not healing. So how are you doing today? What's going on?
[patient]  Doing pretty good except I can't get this ulcer to heal.
[doctor]  Okay, how long has that wound been present?
[patient]  Maybe about a year.
[doctor]  A year well that that's a that's a a long time so when it started I guess did you have any trauma to the foot or did was it just all of a sudden
[patient]  No trauma, it just seemed like a little blister and then I picked at it and it did get a little bit red and infected. So I talked to my primary about it.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  I went on some antibiotics, it seemed to get better, but nothing is really making it go away.
[doctor]  Okay, when was the last time you were on antibiotics?
[patient]  It's probably been five months.
[doctor]  Five months, all right, do you remember which antibiotics you were on?
[patient]  Keflex
[doctor]  Keflex, alright, so kind of does your foot hurt or is it just just the...
[patient]  No pain, but I don't have much feeling in my foot.
[doctor]  Alright, so you've got neuropathy yet, that that makes sense with the diabetes. So have you had any other symptoms like a fever chills any drainage coming from it?
[patient]  Lately there has been a lot more drainage and I just feel a little more tired.
[doctor]  Okay alright well that sounds good so today is Thursday so what do you have for the weekend?
[patient]  Not too much, I'll probably be walking around in the zoo on this ulcer all weekend and eating out and not doing anything my doctor wants me to do.
[doctor]  No, yeah, yeah, I know you do have that diabetes. I know your PCP probably wouldn't be excited about you eating out and all that, but you know, hopefully we can we eye can at least get your foot a little bit better. So your diabetes, I know we talked a little bit earlier. How is that going for you? Is it controlled? You know, what's your blood sugar's running?
[patient]  Yeah, they're running better than they were, but they're still in the 200, so my doctor doesn't like that my last A1C was about 10.
[doctor]  Okay, all right, yeah, I you probably definitely need to get back with your PCP about that because the A1C is is pretty high and I know he probably had you on some medication and insulin and metformin and insulin just to try to get that lower but
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  You know, we are here for your foot. So let's let me take a look at that. So we will do a quick exam of your foot. So you don't have any fever. Your vitals look good. So on your your right foot exam, I can see here you do have a one by two centimeter, two inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of a lateral right foot. So it's just proximal to the fifth MDP joint. I do see some yellow slew that's present with minimal granulation tissue. You have no surrounding erythema or cellulitis, and there isn't any evidence of fluid collection. I don't see necrosis. So there is no dead tissue around it. There's no odor, and I don't appreciate any bony exposure. And does it hurt when I touch it here?
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Okay, so we did an x-ray of your right foot before you came in, and it showed no evidence of osteomyelitis that means that there is no bone infection, which is really good. So let me just talk a little about my assessment and plan of your foot. So you do have that diabetic foot ulcer. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to order a ABI or ankle-brakel index, and that's just to determine your blood supply, just to see if we can. Actually, heel that wound I know it's been there for about a year, which is a pretty long time, and so we just need to see if we can if you do have that blood flow. Just in case we needed to make other goals for that foot, just to depend upon that I'm also going to do a debridement here, have you had that done before of the...
[patient]  Yes, I think so.
[doctor]  Okay, so you know, you know pretty much about that. So I'm just going to try to take off some of that dead tissue we'll do that here in the office afterwards. And then I'm going to prescribe you some collagenase ointment. And you could just add that to your wound once a day and cover it with a sterile dressing. And we're going to try to continue that until we see it start to shrink. And hopefully you know that will work between the debridement. And then the ointment did. They give you at your PCP they give you a surgical shoe or have you been wearing your regular shoes?
[patient]  I've just been wearing my regular shoes.
[doctor]  Okay, so we're going to get you a surgical shoe and I want you to wear that and that can help you take pressure off the area because I know you said you're going to walk around with a sews this weekend. So I definitely don't want you to put much pressure on it from now on and hopefully they can help it heal. And so after all that I'm just going to see you back in two weeks and we could take another look and possible do another debridement of the ulcer. So do you have any questions for me?
[patient]  I don't think so.
[doctor]  Alright so I'll see you back in two weeks and I hope you're fun at the zoo this weekend.
[patient]  Thank you.
[doctor]  Alright, thanks.","CHIEF COMPLAINT

aci,D2N156,"[doctor]  All right, Julia. So you've been coming to see me for a while now ever since you had an RCA STEM place back in 2018, but I see you're here for follow up after an interior STEMI, where we had to put in another STEM right so like how are you doing?
[patient]  While me was a real shock for me, I thought everything was fine after my last heart attack. And then I just started having this horrible chest pain and it wouldn't go away. So I went to the emergency room and yet they told me I needed another stint.
[doctor]  Wow, so you were experiencing similar symptoms similar to what you had the first time.
[patient]  Yeah, it was, yeah, it was bad, it was just like the last time.
[doctor]  Okay, have you had any chest pain or shortness of breath?
[patient]  Now I think I saw you about six months ago and I was doing fine.
[doctor]  Okay, have you been able to like exercise at all since you last saw me?
[patient]  You know I walk my dog every day and you know we go like a mile and a half or two miles.
[doctor]  Awesome, okay. Yeah, you know because like fall is setting in like are you excited?
[patient]  Yeah, I'm excited.
[doctor]  Do you have any like plans for the holiday?
[patient]  No, I'm a mum. No. I'm just, you know, looking forward to seeing family and having some nice weather and yeah.
[doctor]  Okay, so I do want to ask I know that you have a history of coronary artery disease hypertension and diabetes. So I want to get an idea of where you stand with those have you been experiencing any kind of leg swelling.
[patient]  I have noticed that my legs are a little swollen since they sent me home from the hospital.
[doctor]  Okay, are you able to lie flat at night when you sleep?
[patient]  I always use a couple of pillows, you know, maybe I've had to sit up a little bit more, but I mean for the most part one, think it's pretty normal.
[doctor]  Okay, and then have you been able to afford your medications and are you taking them like you're like you were prescribed?
[patient]  Yeah, I'm able to afford to afford them. I have good insurance. I am taking them. They told me it's really important to take them so, so yeah.
[doctor]  Yeah, that's very accurate. You know, like there are huge consequences to not taking them. So if you are noticing any problems, please, please, please, please, let us know how about your diet, are you watching your salt intake?
[patient]  I mean, I'm not eye-eye, I haven't really adjusted. I mean, I tried to watch it after the last heart attack. And now, you know, I've kind of been less strict with my diet, but I'll have to go back to watching the salt intake.
[doctor]  Hmm.
[patient]  I love pizza, it's my favorite food.
[doctor]  Yeah
[patient]  I try to problem my second favorite food.
[doctor]  What are you for her toppings on pizza?
[patient]  Pepperoni occasionally vegetables.
[doctor]  I'm not even more right, but you know that pepperoni is pretty high in salt on top of a cheesy pizza right.
[patient]  I know I know I'm gonna work on it.
[doctor]  Okay, so we are going to have to negotiate some of these diet things, and then especially since you have diabetes, like have you been managing that well?
[patient]  My I've been watching my sugars yet because I don't want to go on insulin so I'm taking that met form in that's why I've been walking my dog I'm trying to stay active
[doctor]  Okay, okay, so you know maybe this is just a situation of like where we are on the right path, but probably need to step up a few things, okay?
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Alright, so I do want to do a quick physical exam, so you are aware I'm going to be calling out my findings as I run through it alright.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Alright, so your vital signs look good, you know? So I'm glad that it looks like you're tolerating your medication pretty well on your neck exam. I don't appreciate any jugular venous distension, so... And then on top of that, I'm not, I don't appreciate any carotid roots, so... I'm not feeling anything like too concerning on your heart exam, though. There is a three over six-histolic ejection murmur heard, at that I'm hearing, at the left base. That's not like a huge deal, especially considering, like, what? You've been through already in terms of the hospital, but it is something that I want to know in your chart when I listen to your lungs, your lungs are clear over here with your extremities. I do notice, you know, some lower, lower edema swelling, sorry, some lower swelling, edema lower, lymphedema. And it is pitting one plus on your right radial artery, the cath side is clean dry, and intact without hematoma, and I also your right radial artery. Pulses are palpable, so I did review the results of your EKG, and they show a normal sinus rhythm and a good, our wave progression. NAA evolutionary changes that are anticipated after STEMI, one of the reasons, though, that we had you come in, is that we noticed on your echo, there is a reduced ejection fraction of 35%, we are a little bit concerned about that, so let's talk about my assessment and plan for you your primary. And like, first diagnosis is going to be coronary artery disease, right? You already have a history of that, but you know, we're going to do some things to make. We're going to continue to evaluate that over time I want you to continue your aspirin 81 milligrams daily, and your Berlin to 90 milligrams twice daily. I want to continue you on a high dose statin called lipitor, and you're going to be taking that 80 milligrams a day, and we're going to continue you on your toprol, and that's going to be 50 milligrams daily. I am going to refer you to cardiac rehab, so we can get you some education and give you some confidence to. Get back to exercising regularly, I know it was kind of scary to have such an episode, but I promise like most of the patients I have love cardiac rehab, and I think you'll do pretty well for your second diagnosis. We have newly, you have newly reduced left ventricular dysfunction, and moderate mitral regurgitation. What I think is like what that means is that you're pumping like the way that your heart is pumping is a bit. Concerning, but I think like given your history that it will improve over. Time they got you into the cath lab pretty quickly, so I think that the muscle is just kind of like stunned, like surprised. And since you're compliant with your meds, I think you will recover. We're going to continue you on your Lycinoprol 20 milligrams daily, however, considering that you are retaining fluid. I think that your third diagnosis is like we are crossing into acute heart failure. I'm going to prescribe something called a diuretics called LASIX, and I do want to we need to take that 40 milligrams. Once a day, I want to add all Dactone 12, 5 milligrams daily, and I need you to get labs. Finally, we will repeat another echo in about two months last, but not least there is the hypertension, your blood pressure. Seems fine. I think with the L Dactone that you'll tolerate that pretty well, but we do want to maybe get you into some nutrition counseling to consider, like what other diet options might be available to you, maybe suggestions of things that you haven't thought about like cutting out. Meet especially any kind of preserved meat like pepperoni, but maybe finding you some alternatives, how does that sound?
[patient]  That sounds good, yeah. So I'm here as long as you tell me I'm gonna get better, I believe you.
[doctor]  Yes, yeah, I strongly believe this is our best course of action and that you'll get better given enough time. I see that you're making efforts. I'm really glad that you're out there walking and that you're cognizant of your diet and willing to make changes. We will just do you know monitor it over time, okay?
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  All right, thank you.","CHIEF COMPLAINT

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up as instructed."
aci,D2N157,"[doctor]  Hey Jose, how are you doing? It's been about you know three or four months since I last saw you what's going on.
[patient]  I'm doing okay. I guess the medications are helping I'm concerned about all the medications I'm taking, but I think I'm doing okay.
[doctor]  Yeah, yeah, you are on a fair amount of medications. You know, we do have you on those medications because you did have a heart attack about six months ago. They put that that stand into your left anterior descending artery. And so that's a major artery on the left side of your heart. And so we need to keep those stents open and then kind of help your heart heal. So it is going to be very important for you to continue on those medications. So you're still taking your aspirin. And are you still taking the brilinta?
[patient]  Yes, and fish oil.
[doctor]  And fish oil. Okay, good now how are you doing with the crere store? I know that that's you know that's the statin, that's the cholesterol medication you were concerned that it might cause you to have some muscle aches or you're taking that.
[patient]  I think I'm doing good, but I might feel like I, when I guess the only complaint that I have is ever since I don't know if this is a heart attack, or if this is the medication, but when I stand up real fast, I get really dizzy.
[doctor]  You get you get dizzy, okay? Yeah, you know, we do have you on what we call a beta block or metaprolol. I think your dose is 50 milligrams once a day, and you know, sometimes it takes a little bit for your body to adjust to that. But yes, if you stand up too quickly, it can cause you to be a little dizzy, so...
[patient]  Okay, okay, that makes sense, okay. That's good to know, because I didn't know what the problem was so can I ask you a question regarding the stance?
[doctor]  Yep.
[patient]  How long do I have to have that in there?
[doctor]  So the stents are permanent, we don't remove them so yet. So that's why it's going to be super important for you. You know you're going to be on aspirin for the rest of your life. And then I'm going to keep you on that Berlinta for another six months that's going to help prevent that stent from clogging.
[patient]  Okay, okay, do I need to ever replace the stance then?
[doctor]  No, I mean, every so often the stents can become narrowed again. But you know that's why you're seeing me or cardiologist, so that I can follow you for that now if you start to have symptoms again of any chest pain like you had before or any shortness of breath. When you start to exert yourself, I want you to tell me and we might have to go ahead and send you for further testing to make sure that those stents are okay. But typically if you continue to take the medication, watch your diet that type of thing. Your stents will stay open for a long time.
[patient]  Okay, all right, that sounds good, you know. I haven't had, hey, I had I know you asked me to follow up with a dietician because I had diabetes as well, which probably contributed to my heart attack.
[doctor]  Yeah
[patient]  I'm any new order, I don't know who I forgot who I was supposed to talk to.
[doctor]  Okay, that's okay. Yeah, I certainly can help you with that now. Managing your diabetes is also going to play an important role in your coronary artery disease, which it sounds like you already know that which is really good. So I will put in another referral for diabetic education for you. How are you doing watching your sweets? I know that you know you do have an affinity for those chocolate chip cookies.
[patient]  It's okay my one C wasn't where I wanted, but my glucose is coming in about 130.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  Fasting.
[doctor]  Okay, what was the what was the A1c, the hemoglobin, A1c if you don't mind me asking?
[patient]  I thought it was close to 60.
[doctor]  Okay, yeah, that's really high, so we want it to be about 6, so you do have some work to do with your diet.
[patient]  Yeah, so okay, so I know you asked me to do a blood test, so I did that I was wondering if you got the results.
[doctor]  I did you know I looked at the results of your kidney function that's what we call your creatinine just because you had some contrast dye and sometimes contrast dye can impact the kidneys and your kidney function is stable, which is great when was the last time you saw your nephrologist.
[patient]  Oh
[doctor]  That's your kidney doctor.
[patient]  I'm a bad, I'm a bad patient, so probably a year ago.
[doctor]  Okay, you know you do have the Stage 3 CKD. So that's the Stage 3 kidney disease. So it is going to be important for you to follow up with your nephrologist just to make sure that everything is okay. Now I did check your kidney function and it was fine, but are you staying away from things like Motrin and AdVal?
[patient]  Right, yeah, that's I threw all of those out.
[doctor]  Okay, good, okay, perfect. Now I know that you're from the West Coast, are you super excited that law won the Super Bowl? Or are you more of a San Francisco 49 or a span?
[patient]  I'm a more of San Francisco fan.
[doctor]  So, do you like Jimmy G? Do you think he can beat Aaron Rogers again?
[patient]  Okay, we'll see what happens, but I'm pretty flexible when he comes to you know that is, but one thing that since I can't take Motrin, what pain killer can I take for headaches.
[doctor]  You can take Tylenol.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Yeah
[patient]  Alright, that sounds good.
[doctor]  Yeah
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  This is I don't think I have any other question. The only thing I'm going to need is I need some refills on my medications.
[doctor]  Yeah, I can do that, but I do want to just do a physical exam on you, okay? So, and looking here at your vital signs here, you know your vital signs look quite good. You know your blood pressure is what right where it should be. It's about 127 over 80, which is great. So you're doing a good job taking your metaprolol now in terms of on your neck exam. I don't appreciate any jugular venous distension or carotid roots on your heart exam. I do appreciate a slight three out of six isolic ejection murmur heard at the left base. And on your lower extremity exam, I do appreciate some one plus non-pitting edema now. What does that mean? What does that mean? Jose. So all of that means is that I do hear a little heart murmur on your heart, which I've heard before in the past. And it doesn't, it doesn't look like you're retaining any fluid, which is good, but you do have a little puffiness in your legs, which sometimes some of the medications can cause.
[patient]  Yeah, I do have that.
[doctor]  So let's just go over a little bit about my assessment and plan for you going forward. So for your first problem of your coronary artery disease, I think you're doing really well, I want to go ahead and refer you for cardiac rehab just so that you can be more active and have some confidence in exercising again. Okay, and I am going to go ahead and refill your metaprolol your Crestor 40 milligrams once a day as well. As the aspirin, okay, I don't think we need to proceed with a stress test or anything at this time, but you know to let me know if you have any symptoms okay.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Okay for your
[patient]  Sounds really good.
[doctor]  Good for your second problem of your stage, three chronic kidney disease. I am going to reach out to Dr. Miller and make an appointment for you to be seen. Just because again, I think it's important for you to follow up with your nephrologist okay.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  And then for your third problem of your diabetes, I am going to go ahead and order another hemoglobin A1c. And I'm going to put that referral in for the dietician to give you some dietary education. And I'm going to go ahead and talk with your primary care physician about your insulin regimen, okay?
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Any questions?
[patient]  You know I've been kind of down ever since I had my heart attack, is there any medication that I could take to make me feel a little bit less sad?
[doctor]  Yeah, I mean are you having any thoughts of harming yourself or harming others?
[patient]  No, no, I just feel kind of down.
[doctor]  You feel kind of down what's your?
[patient]  Life sucks.
[doctor]  What well I don't think, so what's your support system like?
[patient]  You know I live with my dog and that's it so it's kind of you know lonely.
[doctor]  Okay, all right, well, would you be interested in in like a referral to psychiatry or something like that so that you have someone to talk to about some of the issues because medication can help but I do I think it's important to have you know talk some of these things out.
[patient]  Okay, you know I'll give that a try, I mean I'm retiring, I got plenty of time.
[doctor]  Okay, so why don't we go ahead and I'm going to place a referral to psychiatry for you know, you know, difficulty adjusting after having a heart attack. Maybe some some mild depression. Okay, does that sound okay? Okay.
[patient]  Yeah, that sounds really good, thank you.
[doctor]  Okay you're welcome, anything else.
[patient]  So you will do the medication refill, do I. So that's automatic.
[doctor]  Yep, I'm going to put them into the computer and whatever pharmacy you want, you have them.
[patient]  Okay, all right sounds great. Thank you.
[doctor]  Okay you're welcome I'll be in touch bye.
[patient]  Okay, all right, bye-bye.","CHIEF COMPLAINT

"
aci,D2N158,"[doctor]  Yes, so sorry so Barbara is a 31 year old female and she has history of diabetes type 2 and asthma and she is here today with abdominal pain. So Barbara tell me a little more about your abdominal pain what's been going on.
[patient]  So I've been having this pain for the past one week. And as you know, I have a long standing history of diabetes. And I guess I've been drinking too much coffee lately. I don't know if that trigger my gastritis so.
[doctor]  Yeah
[patient]  I think it's been but lately.
[doctor]  Okay, all right. And so is it increasing in severity would you say or staying about the same or what?
[patient]  It's gradually increasing for sure.
[doctor]  Okay, alright, and along with the pain have you had any nausea or vomiting or diarrhea?
[patient]  Naja and vomiting is on and off.
[doctor]  Hmm.
[patient]  So I would say I've experienced nausea for about like three times in the past week.
[doctor]  Okay, okay, and so, and you vomited how many times?
[patient]  A couple of times.
[doctor]  Okay, I've been drinking a lot of coffee you said too. Uh, is that is that Starbucks? I love those nitro-caliberous and Starbucks. We ever had those. Those are incredible.
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  That's...
[patient]  Endo de 20.
[doctor]  Yeah, the for sure you got to go veneon that you really have to coax them into it, though they won't even give you. It's like you need a license to get a veneon that that nitro is so strong, so that's my Achilles heel I tell you. But okay, so you think that might have you think maybe coffee contributed to your abdominal pain, a yee you've been drinking more coffee, and maybe that's related as you're thinking.
[patient]  Yeah, I think so because I started last week and toward the end of last week my coffee intake was pretty bad. So I've been controlling myself this week and you know I probably just had one cup.
[doctor]  Okay, yeah, okay. And so is the pain in your upper abdomen or where in your abdomen is it?
[patient]  It's on both the sides of my upper abdomen.
[doctor]  I'm okay.
[patient]  So I'd also increases when I work out like if I want a jog or like go for run my abdominal pain, just like spikes, you know, so I have to take it easy.
[doctor]  Okay, alright understood. You've not had any fever with that pain have you.
[patient]  No, I haven't.
[doctor]  Okay, all right, and so how about your diabetes? How's your diabetes been doing? How your blood sugar has been? What low 100s to 200s? Where where is it?
[patient]  I think it's been under control, it's 800 so.
[doctor]  Okay, good. And you're still taking them at 4,500 milligrams. Once a day, right now, actually, it looks like last visit we increased that to 500 milligrams twice per day. Is that correct?
[patient]  Yes, that's probably helping me keeping it under control so.
[doctor]  Okay, good good. And then for your asthma, have you had any recent asthma attacks? And are you still taking the flow vent twice a day and are all butyl as needed for wheezing?
[patient]  Yes, but sometimes I forget, you know, I haven't had any asthma attacks lately, so I just figured I could decrease.
[doctor]  Yep, okay.
[patient]  I think that's a good decision though.
[doctor]  Yeah, well, better to stay on the flow vent daily, and then just use the albuterol if you need it, but if you stay on the flow vent daily, it will decrease the frequency of those attacks. So, yeah, all right, well, let's go ahead and examine you okay. So on your physical exam, it's pretty normal for the most part, unremarkable. But I all say on your on your heart exam, you do still have a grade three out of six systolic ejection murmur that's unchanged from your prior exam. And I'm not worried about that. We're kind of watching that, but it just means I hear some heart sounds when your valves are moving. And otherwise normal heart exam for your domino exam, you do have mild tenderness in the epigastrium of your abdomen, your abdomens. Otherwise, soft, there's no tenderness in the right lower quadrant whatsoever. And there is no significant tenderness in the right upper quadrant. So I think you know that's right where your stomach is in the upper abdomen. So I think that you know that maybe you may be right, this could be some gastritis. So then otherwise on your exam on your lung exam, you do have some mild end expiratory weasers very faint and otherwise normal lung exam with excellent air movement and otherwise pretty normal physical exam. So let's talk about your my assessment and your plan here. So first of all for the first problem of the abdominal pain, I do think that you have acute gastritis. And I think this is probably related to the caffeine intake. And I know that you've had AA, moderately heavy history of alcohol use too. So I wanted to cut back on the alcohol as well. You know, keep that down to a dull roller like maybe keep that less than two or three drinks a week would be great. And then also cut back on the caffeine. And that should help. And I'm going to write you a prescription for Xantac as well as we need. And so I'll write you a prescription you can take that twice a day that should help with the acid in your stomach and the pain. And then I'm going to check A your analysis, a urine pregnancy test, a CBC, a comprehensive metabolic panel as well. And we'll see what those results show just to be sure it's nothing else going on. And then for your second problem of diabetes type two, let's continue you on the metformin. But I want to adjust the dose slightly. I'm going to increase the morning dose to 1000 milligrams. And the evening dose we can keep at 500. So we'll go met 4,000 milligrams in the morning and 500 milligrams in the evening. Please continue to check your blood sugars. Let me know what they are when you come back. You know, we just keep track of those. And then we'll see you back in four weeks. By the way, I want to have you follow up with me in four weeks. And for your third problem of asthma, let's continue you on the flow vent that seems to be doing pretty well continue to take that daily. And then also Albuterol is needed. So how does that sound for a plan? Any other questions, comments, suggestions.
[patient]  That sounds good, and I also feel like I'm eating, been eating a lot of spicy food.
[doctor]  Hmm.
[patient]  Lately that could be contributing towards my gas strides. So I'm going to cut back on that as well.
[doctor]  Okay, yeah, I'd also recommend while this is hurting you definitely cut back on the spices, the spicy food easier said than done sometimes I know, but yet the up or right sounds good. Well listen, I'll see you back in four weeks, give me a holler if you have any questions or anything else in the meantime.
[patient]  I will.

aci,D2N159,"[doctor]  Good afternoon, Alexis. I understand you're having some issues with your hand.
[patient]  Yes, I sit at the keyboard all day long and recently I've been having some numbness and tingling in my right hand.
[doctor]  Okay, how long has that been going on?
[patient]  I don't know probably on and off for six months, but over the last month or so it's been a little more persistent.
[doctor]  Okay, okay. And when does that numbness and tingling do you get a lot of pain with it first? Let me ask that question.
[patient]  Some pain.
[doctor]  Some pain.
[patient]  Mostly what I'm actually typing on the keyboard is when I experience the pain.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  But the numbness and tingling is all the time now.
[doctor]  Okay, and when you get this pain, what makes it better is it's stopping and just resting for a while, or do you take medications or try other?
[patient]  I've been taking ibuprofen, so ibuprofen and seem like not typing on the keyboard helps the most.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  The other thing that makes it hurt is my mouse.
[doctor]  Your mouth okay.
[patient]  Wow
[doctor]  Yeah, when you're moving that around okay.
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  Does this pain ever wake you up in the middle of the night? Or the pain or the tingling?
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  No, okay.
[patient]  not affecting my sleep.
[doctor]  Okay, so and you're using Motrin for for ibuprofen for the pain. Well, let me go ahead and take a take a look here at your Is it Both Hands or just your right hand?
[patient]  Mostly my right hand.
[doctor]  Mostly your right hand, okay? So let's go ahead and take a look at that right hand when I bend your wrist does that cause any pain?
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  It does okay and so you do have some pain on extension and if you pull your hand wrist up towards you does that cause the pain also.
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  Yeah, okay, so you do have pain on flexion and extension and when I touch the fingertips here now you said you had some numbness in your thumb and your index finger and a little bit in your middle finger the other two fingers they feel okay or do you think that there is different than the other hand.
[patient]  Yet for some reason it really is just that they thumb the pointer in the middle finger that I experience the most symptoms with.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  Not why that is.
[doctor]  Okay, so I want you to grip my hands here and just squeeze tight, okay? So you do have a little bit of a less grip strength on the right, and that's typical that we would see with this type of pain. And an numbness that you have going on now, I want you to turn your arm over for me, and I'm going to touch on or tap on the inside of your wrist or or form. And when I do that, I can see your face or grimacing so that that must cause that shooting. Pain, yeah, okay. So you do have a positive tunnel sign. So in Alexis, what I think is going on is that you have a carpal tunnel syndrome, and we see that frequent.
[patient]  I was afraid of.
[doctor]  Yeah, you see this frequently, but people who are doing data entry spend a lot of time on keyboards, or you know, some a lot of manufacturing people who do a repetitive procedure again. And again, we'll get that type of pain. So here is my plan I'd like to put you in a splint, and it's it's kind of a wrist splint. I would like you to wear that at night that will help with that I want you to continue with the ibuprofins, but I would like you to go up to 600 milligrams four times a day and...
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  We're going to do that now I am going to order some AA outpatient test called an EMG, where we look at that nerve conduction study in that wrist. And that's really what's happening here is you've got some thickening into the in the wrist, and the the membranes of the wrist that are just pressing down, and just compressing some of those nerves, any other questions for me for now if that test comes back positive, and we'll talk about that later on here. Next, visit if it comes back positive, we may. Have to do, we're going to stick with conservative treatment first, but we may consider some surgery, where I can go in and release that impingement on your nerves through your wrist. It's a simple outpatient procedure, and then I think you would feel better. How does that sound?
[patient]  That sounds like a good plan. I was hoping maybe I could get some relief with some therapy rather than having to go to surgery. So I like that plan very much.
[doctor]  You will start with the the wrist splint, and once I get the nerve conduction studies that will give me another idea whether or not I need to send you some physical therapy in addition, or if we need to go directly to surgery, but that will all hinge on that nerve conduction test. Do you so? Do you have any further questions?
[patient]  No, that's great. Thank you so much.
[doctor]  Thank you very much.","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Right hand pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Alexis Gutierrez is a pleasant 33-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right hand pain.

Approximately 6 months ago, the patient began experiencing intermittent episodes of numbness and tingling in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd digits on her right hand. The numbness and tingling has become constant over the past month or so and is accompanied by pain with typing and using a mouse, which she does all day while working on a keyboard. She denies any sleep disturbance associated with her symptoms. Rest and ibuprofen have been the most helpful at providing symptomatic relief.

SOCIAL HISTORY

The patient reports that she works on a keyboard all day.

MEDICATIONS

The patient reports that she has been taking ibuprofen.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Constitutional: Denies sleep disturbance.
Musculoskeletal: Reports pain in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd digits on the right hand.
Neurological: Reports numbness and tingling in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd digits on the right hand.

PHYSICAL EXAM

MSK: Examination of the right hand: Pain with flexion and extension of the wrist.. Decreased grip strength on the right compared to the left. Positive Tinel's sign.

ASSESSMENT

Right carpal tunnel syndrome.

PLAN

After reviewing her symptoms and exam findings, I believe her symptoms are secondary to carpal tunnel syndrome. We discussed the nature of this condition, as well as her treatment options, in detail. I recommend we treat this conservatively with nighttime wrist splinting and ibuprofen, but I want to increase her dose to 600 mg 4 times daily. I'm also going to order an EMG/Nerve conduction study for further evaluation. If this is positive, we can consider additional treatment with physical therapy or surgical intervention with carpal tunnel release."
aci,D2N160,"[doctor]  Hey, good to see you, Philip. So I see here you're coming and you had some right elbow pain. Also, you have a past medical history of hypertension diabetes. We are going to check up on those as well. So can you tell me what happened to your elbow?
[patient]  Sure, I heard it about a week ago, playing lacrosse with my kids, just suddenly started hurting me when I was throwing the ball.
[doctor]  Okay, okay, so how old are your kids?
[patient]  My oldest is 13 and the other one is 10. I was playing with a 13 year old.
[doctor]  Okay, yeah, I know I play with my kids sometimes and I think I'm getting too old to do all that. So I just I've hurt myself before as well. Alright, so with your elbow, what part of your elbow would you say hurts?
[patient]  It's really like right at the point of the elbow, right at right at the tip of it.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  and it just it hurt hurts anytime I move it.
[doctor]  Anytime I move it, do you remember falling?
[patient]  Now I don't think so, but my kid got pretty rough with me and was checking me several times with a sick.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  So I could have got hit there.
[doctor]  Okay, all right, yeah, that, that, that definitely makes sense. So how would you describe the pain? Is it like a dull pain? Is it stabbing? What would you say?
[patient]  It's a pretty sharp pain.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  Anytime I move.
[doctor]  Okay, and does it radiate down your arm or does it stay in that one spot?
[patient]  It radiates down the forearm.
[doctor]  Radiates down the form. Alright, so have you taken any medications for it to make it better?
[patient]  I tried taking aval couple of days, but I usually just forget about it.
[doctor]  Okay, when you took a did it, did it help it all, did it change your pain score?
[patient]  Yeah, I think it helps some.
[doctor]  Okay, that's good alright, so we'll do a physical exam on that elbow. We'll take a look at it in a second. But I do want to talk to you about your hypertension you came in today. I know you have passed medical history of hypertension. Came in today, your blood pressures, a little bit high. It was a 150 over 7 over 90, which is pretty high today. I see you're on 20 of life, Sinopril. Have you been taking that daily?
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  Okay, so maybe you just have a little white coat syndrome. I know I have that myself. And even though I'm a physician, I still don't like to go to the doctor. So I definitely understand how about your diet. I know we talked a little bit about that before. And you said kind of during the pandemic, you fell off a little bit, how you've been doing that have you been lowering your salt intake.
[patient]  Yeah, but I only eat low salt items avoid adding salt to food. Kind of the whole whole family follows like a Mediterranean diet.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  We try to be pretty good about it.
[doctor]  Okay, yeah, that's good. That's definitely good. Yeah, I know a lot of people during the pandemic, it was, you know, sitting at home and then eating more than we should, but that's I'm very happy that you've been compliant and you have that low salt diet. So let's talk about your diabetes. I think you see here on 500 of Metformin, are you taking that as well, daily?
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  Okay, and your blood sugars, how have they been?
[patient]  Since I don't take insulin, I don't check it every day. When I have checked it, it's usually running somewhere between 80 to 100.
[doctor]  Okay, yeah, that's really good, yeah. So that's pretty good. So what we're gonna do, we're gonna get a 1C just to see you know that range and its possibility, we can we can you know lower that metform and dosage, but we will do that after your visit then we will take a look at that. So let me go ahead and we'll do that quick exam of your elbow. But first I want to make sure you're not having any chest pain or anything like that.
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  No belly pain.
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  All right, so listen to your lungs. So your lungs are clear, bilaterally listened to your heart. So your heart exam, you do still have that grade 2 out of 6 systolic ejection murmur, but we know it about that before. So let me take a look at your elbow. So when I press right here on the back of your elbow, is that painful.
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  Alright, so when I have you, you flex and extend it, it's painful does that does that hurt.
[patient]  Yes, it does.
[doctor]  Alright, so your right elbow exam shows you have pain to palpation of the electron on area of the posterior elbow. You do have mild pain with flexion and extension, but you do have also normal range of motion at that elbow. So we did do an x-ray before you came in and luckily nothing's broken. No fracture, no bony abnormality. So it's a normal x-ray, which is really good. So let me just talk to you a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so you have a elbow contusion. I believe your son did. Hit you with the lacrosse stick and it caused that pain. I see some swelling, little inflammation there. As well, you have a little bit of a bruise. I think that's what happens. So for that I know you're having some pain. I'm going to prescribe you 800 milligrams of ibuprofen. You can take that twice a day and that should help with some of that swelling. And pain, I also want you to ice it three times a day for 20 minutes at a time that should also help with the swelling and pain. And just for the time being for the next couple of weeks, just you know maybe you know not play lacrosse with your son just to help that heal then you can get back on the field. So for your high blood pressure, we're just going to keep you on the hypertension. We'll just keep you on that 20 milligrams of lysinoprol. Looks like you're doing great with that and your diet. And then for your diabetes, we will keep you on the 500 milligrams of metformin. And we will also get a a1c just to check your levels and see if we do need to adjust the medication in the future. All right, so do you have any questions for me?
[patient]  No sounds good.
[doctor]  Alright, so we will see you next time and my nurse will be in with those prescriptions.
[patient]  All right, thank you.","CHIEF COMPLAINT

[doctor]  Man, I know I totally understand. I mean, I do love pizza too, and I love chicken minks, but I do love them with Dallas Cowboys. Not so much the cheese, but everybody's got your preference, but you do have to know you have to watch those, right?

[patient]  Yeah, so I was only able to take off the trash and I, you know, I was icy and I was being very careful. And then I noticed that there must have been a little patch of ice or something because all I know is that I slipped and I was on the ground and I was being really, really careful.
[doctor]  Okay, yeah, I know especially this winter has been rough, so you got to watch for those little ice patches. Sometimes well, okay. So this occurred yesterday after falling on the ice, so have you been able to walk on it at all?
[patient]  When it first happened, I couldn't, and I actually had a friend who was with me, he was actually coming to visit. And so she had to help me up. And so last night, I was, you know, keeping it elevated, I was resting and icing it. So today, it feels a little better like I could put a little bit more weight on it, but I'm definitely still limping it. It's not my normal.
[doctor]  Okay, all right. And tell me what have you been doing for that foot pain since then?
[patient]  You know other than the icing I have taken some ibuprofen and I do feel like it's it is helping.

So, okay, good on the neurovascular exam of your right foot, your capillary refill is less than three seconds with strong. Dorsalus, pedispulse, and your sensation is intact to light. Touch, so that's good sign now. So, Gregory, I did review the results of your right ankle x-ray, and it showed no fracture. So, that's good. So, let's go ahead and talk about my assessment and plan. So, for your problem of right ankle pain, what I'm seeing is that your symptoms are consistent with right ankle sprain. So, what I would like to do is I would like you to keep your leg elevated and especially when you're seated and to continue to ice it okay.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Alright, and then you're going to also be given an air cast, which is really going to help stabilize the ankle. And then you also be given some crutches for the next one to two days. And then you may start walking on it as tolerated.

[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  You know, and I remember talking to my grandmother and my grandfather both, and they don't they said that when they were young they didn't have anything like that. So I had mine checked last year and the doctor said it was a little borderline.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  But it wasn't anything to be worried about that time. It kind of just blew it off. Just told me to watch what I was eating. And now they say it's really hot. And I don't understand what's going on.
[doctor]  Okay, all right, okay. Well, we'll we'll we'll take a look at that. Okay. Now tell me have you had any issues you know with growing growing up bones or feeling okay? You feel like you're growing okay.
[patient]  I guess so I mean when I met with my doctor I they talked about making health goals and making sure that that I feel okay and I decided about two years ago that I don't feel much like a girl I said more just kind of non-gender and that's how I've been living
[doctor]  Yeah
[patient]  But I mean I thought I was healthy.

[doctor]  Right.
[patient]  Nobody smokes my apartment.
[doctor]  Okay, you know if your friends come over if they smoke too, or what okay?
[patient]  Nope.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  No nobody that I spend time with smoke.
[doctor]  Okay, now tell me is there any history at all of like maybe heart disease or sudden death, you know, like early early in those your family's years?
[patient]  Well come to think of it, I did have my grandparents told me that I had a cousin that died. And he was only like 44-45.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  Did they think that he had a heart attack?
[doctor]  Okay, well, I'm sorry to hear that okay. So that's that's helpful information though. Okay, let's go ahead and do physical exam on you there. Julie, I'm going to go ahead and take a look at your vital signs. Looks like your blood pressure looks good. So that's good. Now in your heart exam, I don't appreciate any murmur rubs or gallops on your lung exam. Your lungs are clear on your eye exam. I don't appreciate any zentomas and also on your neck exam. Here there is no thyroid megaly. So now on your abdominal exam, I don't appreciate any hepatomegaly or splenomegaly. Why can I see these today? So I reviewed the results of your cholesterol level and it was elevated at 2 10. So that's high. So let me go ahead and tell you about my plan. So for your problem of elevated cholesterol, what we want to do is you know the American Academy of Pediatrics actually recommends that all children be screen screened once you know they become between ages and 9 and 11 and then again between ages 17 and 20. So that's why you were screened. Okay, so we do we yes. So we do this because studies have shown a link between high cholesterol and premature heart attacks. So I want to go ahead and order full cholesterol panel. There could be other reasons that could be causing the high cholesterol. But I'll go ahead also and check some glucose a complete metabolic panel some thyroid studies and liver panels and I want to perform a genetic testing to see if this problem is familial or this is a secondary. So we're also going to go ahead. I want to follow up in a follow up with a well balanced diet. So including a variety of foods that are lower in saturated fat and sugars. So I want you to follow that and I want you to meet a nutritionist and so who can give you information about what kind of foods to eat? Okay.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  All right, now I do want you to continue to be active and exercise, so that's great especially that you know your bike riding, so you keep that up, that's a great thing, and you're doing well with that, so keep that up for you okay. And then I want to follow up with another cholesterol level in three to six months after you've met with a nutritionist, and then, and they've you know instituted those dietary changes.
[patient]  Okay, it sounds good.
[doctor]  Okay, good well take care, Julie, I'll talk to you soon.
[patient]  Alright, thanks document.
[doctor]  Thank you bye.","CHIEF COMPLAINT

aci,D2N164,"[doctor]  So Elizabeth is a 53 year old female today complaining of chest pain and she has a past medical history of diabetes and high blood pressure. So Elizabeth tell me what's going on with your chest pain.
[patient]  I don't know every time I start walking, I'm just having this kind of pressure and chest pain in my chest.
[doctor]  OK, are you having it now or is it gone right now?
[patient]  Right now it's not there.
[doctor]  Okay, and how long have you been having this?
[patient]  Probably maybe three months.
[doctor]  Okay, and what seemed to bring it on anything exacerbated or relieve it.
[patient]  It mainly happens when I'm walking I like to try and walk, but lately I just haven't been able to keep up with it because I'm having this pain.
[doctor]  Alright, and well how would you describe this pain? It's like a dull pain sharp pain stabbing pain. How would you describe it?
[patient]  I would say it's dull, it's kind of like a pressure.
[doctor]  Okay, and does it go anywhere or radiate any place?
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Okay, alright, but no chest pain right now, no shortness of breath, no sweats, or claminess, or anything like that right now.
[patient]  Nothing right now.
[doctor]  Okay, all right. Well, certainly you know I looked at your EKG that did we did in the office. When you came in the EKG, I don't see any signs of a heart attack or anything like that. So I mean, we should definitely talk about the plan for this chest pain in a few minutes. But right now the good news is I don't see any signs of a heart attack or anything like that. So let's talk a little bit about your other conditions since you are here today. How are you doing with your diabetes? I know we have you on that foreman. And we talked about last time about you know improving your diet and exercise. I'm glad you're exercising, but I'm so sorry to hear about the chest pain. So tell me about how is that going.
[patient]  Yeah, I mean I think my blood sugars have been a little higher because I haven't been able to be active and I'm trying with the diet You know I do love sodas, so I'm really trying strengthos
[doctor]  Yeah, I am addicted to diet coke myself. So I hear you on that one. And we had checked your hemoglobin, a 1C last time it was, you know, 7. Which is pretty good. It's not, you know, it could be better, but it's not, it's not bad. And we talked about sending you to ophthalmology also for an eye exam. Have you seen ophthalmology in the last few months or last before I saw you?
[patient]  I had an appointment in two weeks, it was a long waiting.
[doctor]  Okay, got it. And any nausea vomiting or diarrhea or anything like that with your diabetes or any side effects from your medications that met foreman.
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Okay, all right, good. And I saw also there was a record in your, I was looking at your record before previously, before I walked and you also had, we've been checking your blood pressure. But, but I think you've been into several other clinicians and they had documented high blood pressure. Have you noticed any findings with that? Or have you know, have anybody talked about high blood pressure with you or mentioned that? Because we don't have it in our system here. Yet, but I did add it in today, but we don't. Have you on any medications yet for that?
[patient]  No, I mean, I don't know. Doc, no one told me about high blood pressure. Do I have high blood pressure?
[doctor]  Well, I think the last time you were in the clinic and one of the clinics said the referrals the blood pressure was elevated, so they had mentioned that I noticed a trend in your blood pressure. It's been running on a little bit on the high side. We haven't really diagnosed you with that yet, but I think we are something that we should definitely consider looking at your trend of your blood pressure readings over the last, you know, a few years.
[patient]  Okay, do you think that could be causing me my chest pain?
[doctor]  It certainly could be contributing to that. It certainly could be a factor that we need to look at so.
[patient]  Someone had told me before.
[doctor]  Yummy too, but we can definitely get you started on some monitoring devices for that. And also maybe start you on some diet control things that we can do to help with the blood pressure. And maybe start you on some blood pressure medications if we need to okay.
[patient]  Okay sounds good.
[doctor]  So let me examine you Elizabeth for a second for the because we're running out of time here for a second. So I'm going to go ahead and do my exam. We got taught just in my magical exam and I'm going to go ahead and verbalize some of my findings just so I can get it documented in my note. Okay. And I'll explain things as we go along. So there is no JVD. There is no swelling in your neck. There's no carotid roots. You're long exam is clear. I don't hear any crackles or a ronky or hard exam. You do have a two over six. It's a stalacic ejection murmur. You had that in the past. Otherwise, it's regular rate and rhythm. Your pulses are equal. Your belly exam is nice and soft. You're no tenderness. No guarding. No masses that I can feel on your belly and your back exam is fine. Your extremity exam. You have a little bit of swelling in your lower legs. One plus non-pitting edema or swelling in the in your ankle area. Here, no calf tenderness. So what does all this mean? I'll explain that in a second. So basically your exam is pretty normal except for you have a little bit of swelling in your legs. So you know what this chest pain, I'm a little bit. So the first diagnosis that we talk about is this chest pain I'm worried about my suspicion is you have something called unstable in China, especially considering your history of diabetes and the suspected history of high blood pressure and your family history of heart disease in the past as well. I'm going to go ahead and refer you to cardiology. I reviewed your EKG today. So that looks normal. So that's good. No other signs of a heart attack. But I am worried that you may have some sort of a blockage going on that's causing this chest pain. I'm going to go ahead and start you on some aspirin daily. I'm also going to give you a prescription just a baby aspirin. You can take 81 milligrams once a day. And also I'm going to give you a prescription for nitroglycerin. It's a little pill you split underneath your tongue. You have this chest pain if it doesn't go away. After one or two pills, I want you to go to the hospital call. 9-1-1 and go to the hospital. But we will try to get you into cardiology the next week and get you set up for some sort of a stress test to look at your heart. Okay, any questions about that?
[patient]  So anytime I have a chest pain, even if I'm just like walking I have to take that pill.
[doctor]  Yeah, if you stop walking the chest pain goes away, you don't have to take the pill, but if you are walking or you stop and the chest pain does not go away, I would take the pill and see if it goes away if it is not.
[patient]  How long do I wait to see if it goes away?
[doctor]  about five minutes so you can take it up to three pills every five minutes. And if it doesn't go away then I would you know go to the hospital and get this checked out because I worry about with this chest pain that you're having making sure it doesn't lead to a heart attack. Those chest pain could be a you know AA sign that you may be having some less blood flow to your heart and we need to get that checked out pretty quickly.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Alright.
[patient]  MM
[doctor]  And for the second problem, the diabetes, you know, I think you're doing fairly well, continue with your eye-off-themology appointment you have for your eye exam for the diabetic retinopathy. Continue the metformin 500 milligrams twice a day. I'm going to order another hemoglobin A1c today. And I'm going to have you come back in about two weeks and we can see if we need to make any adjustments continue to try to stay away. From you know that the pop and the sweet things and once we have your heart, take in care of or make sure your heart is okay, you can and we can hopefully resolve this chest pain that you're having get back to your exercise regimen. Okay, any questions about that?
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Okay, and for the third diagnosis, the high blood pressure, you do have a trend I've noticed in your chart that your blood pressure has been running a little bit high, several other people have documented. As well, I'm going to go ahead and start you on some hydrochlorothiazide. It's a pretty low dose medication to help you with your blood pressure plus. It'll also help with you some of the swelling you have in your feet. I'm going to have you use a blood pressure cuff at home and enter your findings at Epic MyCard. And I'll get a reading of those as well. And then what when you come back in two weeks will keep a log of your blood pressure daily in the morning when you wake up and see how things are going. And then if we need to make any adjustments to the medications we can but especially considering your history and the chest pain and the diabetes and the swelling, I think starting this hydrochlorothiazide is probably a good idea.
[patient]  Okay, are there any side effects with this medication?
[doctor]  Yeah, it can cause, sometimes it can cause a little bit of make you go to the bathroom, a little bit more often in the evening. But generally, most people don't have a whole lot of side effects. I'll give you a hand out of the side effects. But sometimes you can have a cross-reaction with some other medications like sulfamedications. But generally, most people tolerate this pretty well.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  All right, any other questions we got?
[patient]  That's it.
[doctor]  Alright well great seeing you thanks for coming in today.
[patient]  Thank you appreciate it.","CHIEF COMPLAINT

RESULTS

EKG was obtained and reviewed in office today and is unremarkable. Hemoglobin A1c: 7.0

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Chest pain.
- Medical Reasoning: Considering her history of diabetes, possible history of hypertension, and family history of heart disease, I suspect her chest pain is likely unstable angina. Her recent EKG was unremarkable and there are no other signs of heart attack, but I am worried she may have some sort of a blockage causing her pain.
- Patient Education and Counseling: We discussed proper protocol for sublingual nitroglycerin for chest pain. I advised her to go to the emergency department if the medication is not effective after approximately 5 minutes.
- Medical Treatment: We will have her start a regimen of baby aspirin at 81 mg daily, for which I have sent in a prescription today. I also sent a prescription for nitroglycerin up to 3 tablets every 5 minutes as needed. Finally, I am going to have her follow up with cardiology for further evaluation.

3. Hypertension.
- Medical Reasoning: Several providers, including myself, have noted a trend of elevated blood pressures in the patient's chart.
- Patient Education and Counseling: I advised the patient to monitor her blood pressures at home over the next 2 weeks and report her readings to me via MyChart. This should help us determine if any adjustments need to be made to her new medications. We discussed the possible side effects of hydrochlorothiazide how this will hopefully reduce some of her swelling seen on physical exam. All of her questions were answered.
- Medical Treatment: I'm going to have her start hydrochlorothiazide at a low dose.

Patient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.

The patient will follow up in 2 weeks."
aci,D2N165,"[doctor]  Hey, Sophia, how are you doing today?
[patient]  I've been better my primary care, Dr. Wantamita C.U. because of this knee pain that I've been having for about six months now.
[doctor]  Okay, do you remember what caused the pain initially?
[patient]  You know, I really can't recall any specific event that caused the pain.
[doctor]  Alright, well, can you describe the pain for me?
[patient]  Yeah, so it's like a deep, achy pain that I feel like it's behind my kneecaps. And sometimes I can even hear what seems like some creaking in my knees.
[doctor]  All right, now tell me what type of activities makes that pain worse.
[patient]  So I feel like the pain gets worse anytime. I'm like getting from like a seated position to standing. So I work from home. Some of my desk a lot. So anytime I get up I have some pain or after watching TV or even like going up and downstairs it's really painful.
[doctor]  Okay, and does anything make the pain feel better?
[patient]  Usually after I rest it for some time, it does help with the pain.
[doctor]  Okay, now you did mention earlier that you have tried some things in the past can you tell me what they were.
[patient]  Yes, when it first started hurting, I was putting ice on it. And I even got like some ace bandage like wrapping from the pharmacy. I do take ibuprofen or a leaf sometimes, but I try to avoid really taking any medications.
[doctor]  Okay, and tell me what is your day like?
[patient]  Well, I try to be as active as I can I actually love to run and I would run like five to six miles a day, but now I mean honestly, I can't even get a half a mile and my leg will start hurting my knee will start hurting.
[doctor]  Okay, that's definitely a decrease in your mileage. There were have you been running lately like do you run outside or on a treadmill or?
[patient]  Yeah, I know I will do the treadmill during the winter, but I just love being outdoors and running.
[doctor]  Yeah, yeah, there are some really nice senior routes here in Boston, isn't there like?
[patient]  There are.
[doctor]  So many new places there's some right by the harbor that I've done some runs there before too. It's pretty nice. Well, I mean the Boston Marathon. What can you say, right?
[patient]  Right, exactly, exactly know it's very nice.
[doctor]  Well, okay, well, hopefully that we get you feeling better, so you can start running again more then. Five miles, but tell me though, have you noticed any swelling or redness in your knees?
[patient]  No, not really.
[doctor]  Okay, and have you ever injured your knees before?
[patient]  No, I've been pretty good. I actually have never broken a bone. Actually, no, I'm going to change that. Actually, I did break my arm when I was in sixth grade, but nothing since then.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  Bye.
[doctor]  Okay, and it's just your arm, right not not your knee.
[patient]  Right?
[doctor]  Okay, well, all right. Well, let's go ahead and do a quick physical exam on you. Here, let me look at your vital signs. Okay. I reviewed your vitals. They, they overall, they look good. Take a listen to your heart real quick. All right. And your heart exam. I hear regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs. And on your musculoskeletal exam, I have seen you and walk around here. And you do have normal gate. All right. Now I'm going to have you do some movements on your legs here. Okay.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  All right, good your strength is three out of five for abduction of legs bilaterally, and the remainder of muscle strength for your lower extremities are five out of five. So that's good. Let me take a look at your knee now on your knee exam. There is no overlying erythema that's redness or echinosis, and that's bruising or any warmth of the skin appreciated. There is no effusion. Let me go ahead and feel around here. Does that hurt right here? How does that feel?
[patient]  It does.
[doctor]  Sorry, so there is tenderness to palpation of the bilateral redinacular redinaculum, and there is positive patellar grine test all right. And can you are you able to squat for me?
[patient]  I can but that hurts.
[doctor]  Okay, all right. So you're definitely having some knee pain with squatting, and I'm just going to maneuver your leg just a little bit here real quick. Okay. So lock my anterior and posterior drawer and McMurray tests are all negative bilaterally. So that's good there. Okay. Now your neuroexamptella and Achilles reflexes are symmetrical. All right. So now I did review the results of your x-ray and both of your knees, which shows no fractures or osteoarthritis. So let me go ahead and tell you about my assessment and plan. So for your problem of bilateral knee pain based on what you told me your exam and reviewing your MRI, your symptoms are consistent with patella femoral pain syndrome. And this is a very common condition that we see that causes knee pain especially in active young people. So this condition has to do with the way your knee cap, which is your patella, how that moves along the groove of your thigh or thigh bone, which is the femur now for the pain you may continue taking ibuprofen or anti-inflammatory as needed to help with the pain. But I'm also going to recommend physical therapy where where they will show you a number of lower extremity exercises. And this will help increase your lower extremities, strength, your mobility and correct any incorrect running mechanics that you may have. So do you have any questions for me about that?
[patient]  while I'll be able to run anytime soon.
[doctor]  Well, that is a goal of treatment and to get you back and running again, now you will have to take and take it easy from running for now, but we will continue to assess your progress with each visit okay.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Alright, anything else.
[patient]  No, I think that's it.
[doctor]  Okay, well very good while I will be following up with you soon, and again just take it easy for now from the running okay.
[patient]  Okay, thank you.
[doctor]  Bye.
[patient]  Bye.","CHIEF COMPLAINT

[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Alright, this is a no-judgment zone. Either I'm working through some things in my head to make sure that I give you the best care that we need right on making a plan, as we move along you mentioned that the pain has been getting worse have you done anything or tried anything that's worked in the past.
[patient]  I try to take some ibuprofen and Tylenol.
[doctor]  Hmm.
[patient]  But that sometimes helps.
[doctor]  Okay, all right, and has anyone discuss the option of like, just no has anyone discuss surgery with you?
[patient]  No, this is the first time I'm talking about it.
[doctor]  Okay, all right, that's good. So what is your like, how what is your activity level right now that I know that you know in a lintic weightlifter with books, what else do you do to like exercise?
[patient]  You know, I try to exercise a few times a week, but I'm pretty inconsistent. I have a sedentary job.
[doctor]  Okay, alright, and has this like pain started to like affect you like in your job or anything like that?
[patient]  Not my job, but I feel like I don't want to be as active as I was previously.
[doctor]  Alright, so do you have any family members that have spine conditions?
[patient]  Yeah, my dad is back pain.
[doctor]  Okay, all right, and then do you smoke?
[patient]  I don't smoke.
[doctor]  Okay, awesome alright. So sorry one question did you have a history of playing sports?
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  Okay, what did you play?
[patient]  soccer
[doctor]  Okay, what position?
[patient]  I played midfield.
[doctor]  Okay, the people who hide in the back that's fine, I was centered forward, fine, no baby. Do you have a team that you wrote for?
[patient]  You know I'm a Tatinum Hotspur fan.
[doctor]  They have the best colors not going to lie, but I grew up Monu so sorry.
[patient]  Well, I won't fault you for that.
[doctor]  Thanks, okay. So if you don't mind, I'm gonna go ahead and do my physical exam. I'm gonna call out my findings just to have them recorded. And if you have any questions, please feel free to stop me and let me know, okay?
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Alright, so looking at your vitals, your blood pressure, seems alright, we are in like the 130 over 70 range that's perfectly fine your respiratory rate. I have you at an 18 again, pretty normal. When I listen here to your heart, you have a regular rate. And rhythm, I don't appreciate any murmurs, rubs, or gallops that means your heart sounds great on your respiratory exam, your lung sound, clear to osculation bilaterally on your. Musculoskeletal back exam, as I'm looking here, I don't. Notice any overlying redness or bruising on the skin when I push here on the midline of your back, does it hurt?
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  Okay, so there is midline tenderness at the L4 L5 disc space with right-sided lumbar pair of vertebral tenderness. Alright, so are you able to bend forward?
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  Alright, and are you able to bend backward?
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  Alright, do either of those actions cause you pain.
[patient]  bending forward
[doctor]  Okay, so pain with lumbar flexion and so I'm going to have you lie down and we're going to do I'm sorry, okay, and then I see that a supine straight like test is positive. All right, so for your neurological exam you said that you are experiencing pain radiating down, radiating down your left leg correct.
[patient]  Yes.
[doctor]  All right, when I touch, are there any like decreased sensation?
[patient]  No.
[doctor]  Okay, all right, so patella and Achilles reflexes are symmetrical, all right. So I received before you came in here, we got an MRI. And so in reviewing your results, it does show a disc desiccation, a disc bulge with paracentral disc herniation resulting in moderate right neuro-feraminal. I don't like this word neuro-feraminal stenosis. What those complicated words is that I just said is that it seems that you have AA, herniated disc with nerve impingement. So let's talk about my assessment and plan all right. Your symptoms are in line with I'm sorry you have lumbar back pain at the L4 L5 disc space due to a herniated disc with ridiculous apathy. This means that one of your discs that sits between your vertebrae like the bones in your spine is bulging out and the bulge is pinching on some nerves. So that's why you're feeling that pain like radiating down your leg. I'm going to recommend something a spinal injection with a strong end said and called the I'm sorry and a corticosteroid. I'm just going to inject it into the lumbar spine under fluoroscopy, which you can think of like an x-ray to localize the exact area of your pain. This should help with the inflammation that's causing your pain. I know that sounds a bit scary at this is a typical procedure that I do all the time. It's an office and we can get you scheduled today if you would like. So what questions do you have right now?
[patient]  Is that something that we can do today?
[doctor]  Yeah, I think I have time in my schedule to get a done today, just you know I'm here for you right now.
[patient]  All right.
[doctor]  Okay.
[patient]  Are there any complications with this?
[doctor]  There are, sorry, yeah, you're right, there are risks associated with this kind of injection, just like any procedure, but we aim to minimize them. And my mom, when she comes in, we will give you some paperwork with explanations and any and hopefully answer most of the questions that you have. If after reading that you have any more questions, please feel free to stop us. We want to make sure that you feel as comfortable as possible during this time.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Alright.
[patient]  Great.
[doctor]  Anything else?
[patient]  I think that's it.
[doctor]  Alright.","HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

aci,D2N167,"[doctor]  Angela, good to see you today. So I'm writing here in my notes that you're coming and you had some left knee pain. So how did you hurt your knee?
[patient]  Yeah, so I hurt my knee the other day when I was running around with my niece. She is learning how to take off the training wheels for her bike.
[doctor]  Hmm.
[patient]  And I fell and I think I twisted my knee in some kind of funky way.
[doctor]  Okay, that's not good how old are your knees.
[patient]  She's 5 and perfect.
[doctor]  Well, that's good that you're trying to help her with the learning how to ride a bike.
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  That sounds fun, but I'm sad as you hurt your knee doing it. So for your knee pain, are you able to bear weight on that leg the left leg?
[patient]  While I've been limping ever since, and it really hasn't gotten better, so I thought it was maybe time to come see you because it happened about a week ago.
[doctor]  Yeah, yeah, it's definitely a good time to come see me, so what part of your knee would you say it hurts?
[patient]  Honestly, it's been hurting on both sides more so on the inside than the outside.
[doctor]  So, okay, so more in the medial aspect, less on the lateral, okay, that makes sense. And you said did you hear a pop when you when you twisted it?
[patient]  Yeah, I did.
[doctor]  Okay, all right, so how would you rate your pain with your knee out of out of one to ten?
[patient]  It started off as like a four, but I think it's getting worse and it's starting like it's like a throbbing kind of pain, yeah.
[doctor]  Alright, and have you taken anything for the pain?
[patient]  Yeah, so I like a ulcer not too long ago. So my doctor told me that I couldn't take any like kind of adveau or ibuprofen.
[doctor]  Hmm.
[patient]  So I've been taking some Tylenol and I wrapped it with Kinneziology tape. Are you familiar with that?
[doctor]  Yep, yeah, I'm familiar.
[patient]  Okay.
[doctor]  Alright, and has the Has the IBi Profin been helping you at all?
[patient]  I can't take ibuprofen.
[doctor]  I mean I'm sorry the Tylenol.
[patient]  No, it's okay, but the Tylenol helps like a little bit, but you know, like it's like a time limit right, so by the time, and I'm not supposed to take it like more than like every like four hours or something like that, but by hour two, like it hurts again.
[doctor]  Okay, yet that yeah, you can't take too much of that Tylenol because it'll mess up your liver definitely.
[patient]  Right?
[doctor]  Alright, so go ahead and do a quick exam on your knee here. So when I press here, does that hurt?
[patient]  You like when you press on the inside that hurts a lot?
[doctor]  Okay, all right, I'm going to do a couple of other maneuvers here for your knee. So on your left knee exam, I do appreciate some edema. You also have some effusion, some fluid in the knee. You have moderate range of motion. So you're able to move it a little bit, but not all the way. I also see you have some pain on flexion and extension of the knee, even negative lockments test and a negative valgus and baris test as well. So all that to say is I don't think anything is as torn in your knee based on the your physical exam. So we did do a x-ray of your left knee and luckily it was normal. So there is no fractures, no bony abnormalities. So everything is good there. So let me talk to you a little bit about my assessment and plan for your knee okay.
[patient]  Yeah.
[doctor]  All right, so for your left knee pain, I believe you have an MCL strain or a medial collateral ligament that's the inside of your knee, I think when you were running with your knee, she had somehow twisted it. And so you strain that ligament there. So for that, what I want to do, I'm going to give you some pain medication that's not an N-side. So I will put you on some tram at all. You can take 50 milligrams. You can do that twice a day. And then you can take that Tylenol as needed for breakthrough. Pain all right. I'm going to put you in a knee immobilizer, leg knee immobilizer. And you can wear that for the next week. I just want to keep the knee for moving so it can heal a little bit and reduce some of the inflammation that you're seeing here. And I also want you to ice it. And you can do that three or four times a day for 20, 30 minutes at a time. And that should help some of that swelling as well. And I know I know your niece is going to be upset, but I just don't want you to be running. Probably for the next three weeks, with her just to help us get time to let allow the knee to heal. So how does that sound?
[patient]  That's alright, how long do you think it'll be before I can run or something like that?
[doctor]  Hmm, I think you'll be back to normal in about a month, the strain doesn't seem too bad, but we just need to get you off of the knee, so we can allow it to heal. I mean, once we do that, you know along with you know the icing, the mobilization, and you're taking the medication, I think you'll be good to go in a month. If you do feel like you're getting a little bit worse, please feel free to call the office, and we can get you in and possibly do more imaging such as an MRI to you notice see if it's anything. Worst, but I don't think it is, but just let us know how you feel in a couple of days.
[patient]  Okay, all right, thanks.
[doctor]  All right, any other questions?
[patient]  No, that's it.
[doctor]  Alright, great thanks!","HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Angela Powell is a pleasant 81-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of left knee pain. The onset of her pain began 1 week ago, when she was running around with her niece and fell. At the time of the injury, she heard a pop and believes that she twisted her knee. She reports that she has been limping since the injury. The patient locates her pain to the medial and lateral aspects of her knee. She rates her pain level as a 4 out of 10, however this is increasing. Her pain is described as a throbbing pain. The patient has been taking Tylenol, which has provided mild and temporary relief, as well as wrapping her knee with kinesiology tape. She states that she is unable to take ibuprofen secondary to an ulcer.

PHYSICAL EXAM

MSK: Examination of the left knee: Edema and effusion noted. Moderate ROM. Pain with flexion and extension of the knee. Negative Lachman's. Negative valgus and varus stress test.

RESULTS

4 views of the left knee were taken. These reveal no evidence of any fractures or dislocations. No other abnormalities are noted.

ASSESSMENT

Left knee pain, possible MCL strain.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have discussed with the patient that her x-rays did not reveal any signs of a tear. I have recommended that we treat the patient conservatively. The plan is to place the patient in a knee immobilizer to provide increased support for the next week. I have also prescribed the patient tramadol 50 mg to treat her pain. She can take Tylenol as needed for breakthrough pain. I have also advised her to ice her left knee 3 to 4 times a day for 20 to 30 minutes at a time. I have advised her to refrain from running for the next 3 weeks. If her pain does not improve with the immobilizer, I will recommend obtaining an MRI.
