She is being seen in office today for status post-Mitral Valve repair done on August 3, 2020. At her previous follow-up on 917, we felt that she was doing quite well from a cardiac standpoint, and so we recommended she continue with the same medication. ECG taken on December 26, 2020 reveals atrial fibrillation with a controlled ventricular response, T-wave inversion anteriorly. Compared to the previous study, there are no significant changes. Oh, and please add in the history, patient has a history of mitral regurgitation and atrial fibrillation, history of diabetes, asthma, and recurrent chest discomfort with negative cardiac workup for coronary artery disease. Hanna Sanchez is good to see you again. Yes, good to see you to Dr. Hughes. Feel like you're doing well. All I and thank you to you're looking great how you've been feeling pretty good. I am definitely feeling better thank goodness. I was having a rough time before surgery, but I think I'm overall pretty good now though. Okay, well that is really good to hear. I'm glad are you having any new symptoms right now? No, not really, but you know I'm still getting some chest pain. Sometimes, and my breathing gets shallow, but I guess I'm learning what I can and can't do so if I feel like that, if I'm like exerting myself, I slow down a bit which helps, and then when I go back to later, I can usually finish whatever I was doing. Okay, so it does go away though. How long does that episode seem to last only a few minutes? I guess then it disappears for a while. Weird. What is a while? It goes away for a couple weeks. So what happens? I just take the day nice and slow. I don't push myself. Okay, so maybe it is a couple times a month. You feel this way. Yeah, just often for me to notice understood. Okay, are you taking your medications regularly? Have been trying to keep up with that. There's a lot of extra pills now, but to have a reminder app. So I do pretty well okay. That is great. And so you're taking Cumidin right. You also lay six and the attendle all are you having any side effects from the medications at all. Not really. I noticed that the attendle is making the irritable in the beginning, but I guess I got used to it. Doesn't seem to bother me as much now. Okay, well that sounds good. Sounds like you're well on the mend. So why don't I start out with the physical exam and just check you out?\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  You're going to hear me describe things in detail or repeat things as I go to reference later for my notes.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Okay then I'm going to be using my status post template MS. Sanchez please lie down on the table here and we'll get started on right, can you turn your head to the left head and neck no JVD detected. You can turn back now and just take a couple of deep breaths for me please. Okay that's good and lungs have reduced breath but osculation and percussion are clear. Okay breathe normally. I'm just going to listen to your heart. Rhythm is irregularly irregular yet it does sound kind of weird right it is when your heart doesn't beat with the correct rhythm and whatever rhythm it doesn't have a pattern to it so it is part of the atrial fibrillation while that sound like a mass yet it is not ideal but many people have a. Fib are able to keep it under control with medicine and lifestyle changes AC not good to know okay so S1 slightly accentuated no S3 I'm going to touch your belly and does any of that hurt?\n[patient]  Nope.\n[doctor]  How about there? And your feet know not really okay great and trace peripheral edema on extremities, all right MS. Sanchez you can sit up now so it looks like your health heart heart bals are working well and you are recovering from the surgery nicely all good. Yes, we are re-looked to your ECG taken earlier today and we are seeing the A. Fib but it is being well controlled with the medicine and you're taking cumidain 4 milligrams lasex at 4 milligrams a day and the tenelol you're taking that every day as well, right? Yes, the 50 milligrams every day great it sounds like you're well on your way to recovery great. So let's continue on your current meds. I'm glad that you are figuring out what your body can handle definitely try to keep active as that will certainly help all your best and that is about it to have any questions for me. I do when do I need to come back and get checked out well I don't think you need to come back soon everything from a cardio. Perspective is fine so I think let's do a follow up in about six to nine months. Thank you it was good to see you again doctor Hughes you as well as Sanchez to take care of you too.",

How are you today?\n[patient]  I'm good, thank you.\n[doctor]  Good. Well, what brings you in to see me today?\n[patient]  Well, my doctor says that I have a heart murmur.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  So I don't know how big a heart murmur I have or really even what it is.\n[doctor]  Okay, so how long have you had that for? Do you have any idea or is that completely new as far as you know?\n[patient]  Yeah, she said it the new, worrisome heart murmur. So of course I'm worried as well.\n[doctor]  Got it. Okay. And are you having any symptoms at all?\n[patient]  I don't think so. I don't know what symptoms I should be having.\n[doctor]  Okay. Well, so you are 100, so we can't really get around that one, so I expect that you probably don't move quite as fast as maybe you used to.\n[patient]  No, I definitely don't.\n[doctor]  Okay, and do you notice that you have any chest pain or feel shortness of breath?\n[patient]  No, I don't have any chest pain. My problem is I have severe pains in my legs, and so she had me go in for chest x-ray. And that was just last week.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  And so I started taking pain pills for my legs.\n[doctor]  Okay, got it for the legs, and do you feel short of breath at all?\n[patient]  If I walk too fast or too long, or if I try to drink a whole glass of water without stopping, then yeah, I do get sure breath that way.\n[doctor]  Okay, and how far can you walk before you feel short of breath or sort of overly fatigued?\n[patient]  Well, I do have a walker now, so I don't know. Maybe when I walk to the end of the driveway or walk around the cul-de-sac.\n[doctor]  Got it, alright.\n[patient]  So it isn't that bothersome to me at all, maybe more if I try to overdo it.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  Then I get short a breath if I do overdo it though.\n[doctor]  Okay, got it and so how did for would you say that these symptoms are now compared to like six months ago or a year ago?\n[patient]  I would say probably 70 to 80% from about 6 months ago. Before that, I didn't notice anything at all.\n[doctor]  Okay, so do you feel like it's mainly the leg pain that seems to limit you?\n[patient]  My legs have been severe for about a month now.\n[doctor]  Okay, and how about you feel light-headed or dizzy at all?\n[patient]  Yeah, so I do take a pill for that when it does get bad.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  Yeah, and I don't take it every day, only when I do feel dizzy.\n[doctor]  Okay, and so how about any passing out at all?\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  Okay, good. And how about irregular heartbeats? Do you ever feel like your heart is going too fast or like it skips a beat?\n[patient]  I don't notice it at all.\n[doctor]  Okay, great. And how about any swelling in the legs at all?\n[patient]  Yeah, my ankle swell.\n[doctor]  Okay, and how long has this been going on?\n[patient]  I would say for probably six months, but it goes up and down and sometimes it's worse than other times.\n[doctor]  Okay, and how about any recent weight gain or anything else like that?\n[patient]  I lost a little bit of weight, but I still weigh 120 pounds, but I normally weigh about 130 pounds.\n[doctor]  welcome\n[patient]  But that's been going down gradually for about a year.\n[doctor]  Okay, and then how about any fevers, chills or anything else that's going on that you can think of?\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  Good. So mainly it sounds like you came in mostly because of the murmur. Is that right? And sort of just kind of seeing what things look like?\n[patient]  Yeah, and I feel overly tired because I take all that medication.\n[doctor]  Okay, and so fatigue as well, and have you ever had any testing of your heart done?\n[patient]  I'm not really sure.\n[doctor]  Okay. It does look like you've had a decent number of surgeries here, huh?\n[patient]  Yeah, you name it.\n[doctor]  All right, well, I will make you repeat them since I do have a good record, but just give me just a second and I'm going to enter the ones we need, okay? All right, got them. And then are you taking all the medicines that you went through with Madison?\n[patient]  Yes.\n[doctor]  Okay, good and looking at your family history looks like maybe your brother had a heart attack. Is that correct?\n[patient]  It was actually my son, not my brother.\n[doctor]  Okay, I'll make that adjustment.\n[patient]  But my brother did have a stroke, but that was because he had gotten sugar diabetes, and my older sister did have a heart problem as well.\n[doctor]  Okay, I see.\n[patient]  Yeah, so heart problems kind of run in the family.\n[doctor]  Okay. Alright, well, it looks like also that you've never smoked. That's excellent. And then no allergies to medicines that you know of. Is that correct?\n[patient]  Correct.\n[doctor]  Alright, well let's do a quick exam.\n[patient]  Alright, sound good.\n[doctor]  Alright, well for physical exam, please use the regular template. Alright, please just breathe normally. Great, and now take a few deep breaths for me. Alright, do you feel okay? Are you feeling any dizziness or anything?\n[patient]  No, I feel fine.\n[doctor]  Okay great. Alright, well that is it for the exam.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Alright, so what I'm thinking is let's go ahead and schedule you for an echocardiogram. It's a very common test and it just takes a picture of your heart and it'll let me see how well your heart is actually working.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  And I can order that for today. Do you have time to complete that? It shouldn't take too long.\n[patient]  Yes, that's fine. I have time.\n[doctor]  Okay, great. So we will complete that today to overcess your overall cardiac structure and function, as well as the valvular disease.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  and some possible outcomes and what we might suggest to fix it. I'll go over that. So one possible suspicion I'm having is it's called aortic stenosis and that just means that one of your main valves of your heart has narrowed a bit and the valve doesn't really open quite fully and this could just reduce or block the blood flow from your heart into the main artery of your body and that's called the aorta into the rest of your body.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  And if this is severe, then we might want to perform a procedure called the trans-catheter aortic valve replacement, or we wrote just called it tovr, and it is a minimally invasive procedure to replace the valve.\n[patient]  Why would I have to think about that? I... I'm not too sure I want to do that, give him my age at all.\n[doctor]  Yeah, sure, no problem. And we don't have to make any decisions today, just you know I wanted to go over a couple of these things. But sometimes we can also perform a surgical aortic valve replacement, or it's called an SAVR, but really because of your age and medical history, unfortunately, that wouldn't be a good option for you.\n[patient]  I see. Okay. Well, I guess we'll see what you see from from the test.\n[doctor]  Yeah, agree. Okay. And so, a couple other things real quick. So, it looked like your blood pressure looked really good today. So, we're not going to change your amlodipine or lysinoprol. So, just continue taking those as you are currently.\n[patient]  Okay, good.\n[doctor]  And then it also looks like you are taking about 20 milligrams of sympathatin for your lipids. And I will defer to your PCP, however, given you are having leg pain in both your legs and given your age and no history of coronary artery disease, it is possible that you might be able to stop your statin.\n[patient]  Really?\n[doctor]  Yeah, possibly he would have to evaluate you, but it is certainly something to discuss with him. So I will send over the results of the echocardiogram and also my recommendations, and then you guys can talk about the statin.\n[patient]  Okay, that sounds great. Thank you.\n[doctor]  You're welcome. And then lastly, your hypothyroidism. I see you're taking the levothyroxen, and again, no change here. And you can just keep taking that as you have been.\n[patient]  Okay, I will.\n[doctor]  Alright, so we'll see you back here in about three to four weeks to discuss the results and your next steps and we'll take care of your echocardiogram today. Any questions?\n[patient]  Not that I can think of. Thank you so much. I think I will sweat.\n[doctor]  Okay, awesome. Alright, well, have a good rest of your day, and we will see you soon. For physical exam, constitutional, elderly, otherwise no acute distress. Cardiovascular normal. S1 and S2 is preserved with a normal rate and regular rhythm. There is a 4 out of 6 systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border with mild radiation to the carotids. Neurologic, gate is normal for age. For assessment and plan, probably one cardiac murmur, Diana has a 4 to 6 systolic murmur at the upper right sternal border with mild radiation to the carotids. This is most likely representative of aortic stenosis. Her symptoms could be due to severe aortic aortic stenosis, however, her S2 is relatively preserved, which would be more consistent with consistent with moderate. Some of her outside records do note diastolic dysfunction, so it is possible she did have an echocardiogram at some point in the past. She does not appear significantly volume overloaded today. Her next problem is PVCs. Her referral mention TACAcardia. Her EKG today shows sinus rhythm with frequent PVCs, as well as an anterior septum in fart pattern. She does not have any significant palpitations, and we will check an echocardiogram to assess overall cardiac structure and function. Depending on results, as well as the severity of her aortic stenosis, we will need to consider an ischemic evaluation, or further possibly a heart monitor to assess overall burden of the PVCs. At this point, she is asymptomatic, so we will start with the echocardiogram only. Her next problem, hyperlipidemia, is managed by her PCP, due to bilateral leg pain over the last month. Consider tovra evaluation following echocardiogram. Could be indicated and next problem, lightheadedness, dizziness. She is on mechlazine for this. It is possible that some of her lightheadedness and dizziness is related to the aortic stenosis, and we will do an echocardiogram as noted above. PVCs on her EKG could be contributing, but she does not feel palpitations. We will consider a monitor, but start with the echocardiogram first as noted above. Follow up three to four weeks after her echocardiogram is done to discuss results and next steps. End of dictation.",

She denies chest pain, syncope, palpitations, fevers, or chills. She reports shortness of breath if she walks too fast, too long, or tries to drink a whole glass of water without stopping. The patient requires a walker and can walk around her cul-de-sac or to the end of the driveway without shortness of breath. Compared to 6 months ago, her functioning has declined 20-30%. Prior to 6 months, symptoms were absent. For the past month she has been experiencing severe, bilateral leg pain, which was limiting her mobility. She did see her doctor last week who completed a chest x-ray and prescribed pain medicine. Occasionally, she feels dizzy but takes medication for this and it subsides. Her ankles have been swelling for the past 6 months, but the swelling fluctuates day to day. Her weight has been slowly decreasing over the past year, with her current weight at 120 pounds, previous weight was 130 pounds. She also reports feeling \u201coverly tired\u201d but attributes this to her polypharmacy.\n\nThe patient is unsure if she has completed any cardiovascular testing.\n\nPAST HISTORY\n\nMedical\nHyperlipidemia.\nHypertension.\nHypothyroid.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nRequires a walker to ambulate.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY\n\nSon had a myocardial infarction.\nBrother had a stroke and has diabetes.\nOlder sister has an unknown heart problem.\nFamily is positive for heart disease.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS\n\nLevothyroxine.\nLisinopril.\nSimvastatin 20 mg.\nMeclizine.\nAmlodipine.\n\nALLERGIES\n\nNo known drug allergies.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nConstitutional\nElderly, no acute distress.\n\nCardiovascular\nNormal S1, S2 preserved, irregular rhythm and normal rate. 4/6 systolic murmur at the RUSB with mild radiation to the carotids.\n\nMusculoskeletal\nLower extremity edema\n\nNeurologic\nGait normal for age.\n\nRESULTS\n\nEKG\nImpression: Sinus rhythm with frequent PVCs as well as anterior septal infarct pattern.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\n\u2022 Cardiac murmur.\n\u2022 PVCs.\n\u2022 Hypertension.\n\u2022 Hyperlipidemia.\n\u2022 Hypothyroid.\n\u2022 Lightheadedness/dizziness.\n\nPLAN\n\nCardiac murmur\nDiana has a 4/6 systolic murmur at the RUSB with mild radiation to the carotids. This is most likely representative of aortic stenosis. She does have symptoms including a significant increase in fatigue over the last 6 months, shortness of breath, and some lightheadedness. This could be due to severe aortic stenosis, however, her S2 is relatively preserved which would be more consistent with moderate. She is unsure if she has had an echocardiogram, although some of her outside records do note diastolic dysfunction, so it is possible that she had one as some point in the past. We will order a repeat echocardiogram today to assess overall cardiac structure and function as well as valvular disease. If she does truly have severe aortic stenosis, I briefly discussed a TAVR procedure today as she is not a candidate for a surgical AVR given her age co-morbidities and frailty. She is unsure if she would be interested in this, but we will assess first with the echocardiogram and then discuss further at follow-up. She does not appear significantly volume overloaded today.\n\nPVCs\nHer referral mentions tachycardia. Her EKG today shows sinus rhythm with frequent PVCs as well as anterior septal infarct pattern. She does not have any significant palpitations. We will check an echocardiogram to assess overall cardiac structure and function. Depending on results as well as the severity of her aortic stenosis, we will need to consider an ischemic evaluation or possibly a heart monitor to assess the overall burden of PVCs. At this point, she is asymptomatic, so we will start with the echocardiogram only.\n\nHypertension\nShe is taking amlodipine and lisinopril. We will continue these as is.\n\nHyperlipidemia\nThis is managed by her PCP. She is on simvastatin 20 mg. She is having bilateral leg pain over the past month. This could be related to the simvastatin possibly and given her age, it would not be unreasonable to stop the simvastatin, but I will defer to her PCP. She has no known CAD but if we were to do a TAVR evaluation and this was discovered, a statin would be indicated.\n\nHypothyroidism\nShe takes levothyroxine for supplementation and will continue this as is.\n\nLightheadedness/dizziness\nShe is on meclizine for this. It is possible that some of her lightheadedness and dizziness are related to the aortic stenosis, and we will do an echocardiogram as noted above. She is also having some PVCs on her EKG, which could be contributing, but she does not feel palpitations. We will consider a monitor but start with the echocardiogram first as noted above.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nFollow-up in 3 to 4 weeks after her echocardiogram is done to discuss results and next steps.\n",

No additional family history. Hi, Kayla. I'm Dr. One Price. I hear you are starting to get some acne on the face. How about the chest and back?\n[patient]  It's not too bad.\n[doctor]  So it's not bad on the chest or back. You've used some over-the-counter items like washes and person gel?\n[patient]  Yeah.\n[doctor]  Do those seem to be helping?\n[patient]  Yes, I think so a little bit.\n[doctor]  Good. What's your skincare routine like now?\n[patient]  Do you want to know like the things I currently use?\n[doctor]  Yes. What do you do for your acne in the morning? And then what do you do at night time? I wash my face more like I wipe it down in the morning then. At night, I use an L facial cleanser called the Super Clarity Cleanser. I finish with a toner and then the person gel. When you say wipe your face in the morning, do you use a product or just water?\n[patient]  Hmm, just water and a washcloth really. If I feel really greasy, sometimes I'll use the Elf cleanser in the morning too.\n[doctor]  Okay, and is today a good day, bad day, or an average day for you?\n[patient]  I would say it's probably a good day for me, of course, since I'm here, right?\n[doctor]  Acne is always good when you come to see the doctor. Do you find that your acne flares with your periods?\n[patient]  No, not really.\n[doctor]  And, do you get a regular period?\n[patient]  Yep.\n[doctor]  How long have you been getting a regular period?\n[patient]  I think about two years.\n[doctor]  Okay. The biggest flair probably was when she started school sports in the fall just with all the sweating. Yeah, I'll do it. Is there anything else that you've noticed Mrs. Ward?\n[patient]  No, Kayla really has been doing a good job with a facial care regimen. It just doesn't seem to help as much as we want it.\n[doctor]  Got it. Okay. Well, let's take a look then. Full exam is performed today, except for under the underwear, and under the bra multiple benign navy on the trunk and extremities scattered skin colored papules open and closed comodones and arithematous papules on the face primarily on the forehead, and with also some on the central cheeks and chin, the chest and back are relatively spared. And the remainder of the examination is normal. So what I'm seeing from your exam today is mild to moderate acne, mostly come Donald with small inflammatory component.\n[patient]  Okay, so is there anything we can do to help it?\n[doctor]  Yes, I would like to start with a topical therapy first. Every morning, you will wash your face with a mild cleanser. Then use a moisturizer label non-commitogenic with sunscreen, SPF30, or higher. This means it won't clog your pores. Now in the evening, wash your face with the same cleanser and allow it to dry. Apply a Dappeline 0.1% cream in a thin layer to the areas you generally get acne. I want you to start off using this a few nights a week and slowly work up to using it every night. If it is excuse me, if it is very expensive or not covered by insurance, you can try different gel over the counter. You can follow that with clean and clear, burst of gel and a thin layer where you generally get acne and then a non-communogenic moisturizer. Your topical retinoid won't cause sun sensitivity, so you will need to wear sunscreen when you are outside. It may also cause some dryness or irritation.\n[patient]  Okay, I can do that.\n[doctor]  You also have multiple benign moles on your arms, legs, back, and abdomen. This means they all look normal with no worrisome features. We will see if you have any progress over the next six months and follow up at that time.\n[patient]  Okay, that sounds good. Thank you.\n[doctor]  Do you have any questions for me?\n[patient]  no i don't think so\n[doctor]  Okay, if you have questions or concerns before your next visit, please call the office.\n[patient]  Thank you, Dr. Wewill.",

He fell five months ago going up the stairs and the pain has been present since.\n[doctor]  Hi Mr. James, I'm Doctor Isabella, how are you doing?\n[patient]  I'm okay, thank you.\n[doctor]  That's good. That's good. Tell me what brings you in today.\n[patient]  Sure or so. I've been having constant pain in my left shoulder and left elbow for a while about five months or so. It hurts all the time, pretty bad at times.\n[doctor]  Hmm, that does not sound like fun. It sounds like you injured it going up the stairs?\n[patient]  Yes, that's correct. It was I see, and I have to walk up a flight of stairs to my house. I stepped in my feet, just went out, fell on my left side. Seems like my shoulder and wrist took the brunt. It's been hurting since.\n[doctor]  Yeah, that does seem like a likely cause of your symptoms. Anything seem to make the pain worse?\n[patient]  Well, I've always at the gym and lifted weights. I've been trying to keep with my routine of two days a week, but it's been hard. The pain is worse when I lift, and I haven't been able to lift more than 15 or 20 pounds, which is very frustrating.\n[doctor]  Vahem! I can imagine it is when you're so accustomed to your routine.\n[patient]  Exactly. I really enjoy my exercise, but over the past one to two weeks, I stopped hitting the gym, because the pain just wasn't worth it honestly. I do keep up with my walking though. My wife and I walk about 30 minutes almost every day. We have done this since I retired from my office job last year.\n[doctor]  I do not blame you, mister. James, does anything seem to help the pain that you've tried?\n[patient]  Not too much. I have iced a bit, but I have not taken anything for the pain. Stopping the exercise and some ice has helped a bit, but it's still hurt enough for me to come see you.\n[doctor]  Yeah, okay. How about any numbness or tingling? Have you felt that at any point? No, document just pain. No tingling or numbness. Numbness, thankfully. Understood, understood. All right, well, let's go ahead and take a look and see what's going on.\n[patient]  Sounds good. Thank you.\n[doctor]  Okay. Use my general physical exam template. Mr. James, I'm going to gently press around your shoulder and elbow here to see where your pain might be stemming from. Just let me know when it hurts.\n[patient]  Okay, it hurts when you press there on my elbow and hear on my shoulder.\n[doctor]  Okay, left shoulder and elbow tender assay space. No warmth, erythema, or deformity. Positive kiss the elbow and near's test. Normal proximal and distal distal upper extremity strength. Intact median, radial, ulnar sensation, and abduction to 90 degrees. Normal empty, can test. Okay, Mr. James, what I think you are dealing with is impingement syndrome of your left shoulder. I don't think there is an additional injury or issue with your wrist, but because everything is connected.\n[patient]  You're experiencing pain and your wrist because of your shoulder. We do see this type of issue when someone has a fall. So it's good you can't see us. He came in to see us so we could help. So what are the possible treatments?\n[doctor]  Well, we have a few options you can try. First option would be to start with physical therapy. I would recommend two sessions per week, as well as any other exercises they give.\n[patient]  You to do at home, we can start if that doesn't improve your pain, then we could try a cortisone injection.\n[doctor]  I like the idea of starting with a physical therapy and have a next step if it doesn't help. I am not opposed to a shot but would like to try the therapy first. All right, great. I'll get a referral ordered and they will call you within the next day or two to get you scheduled.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  And then, also, please continue to ice especially your shoulder and rest as much as you can.\n[patient]  Okay, I will.\n[doctor]  Give us a call or email if you have symptoms worsened, if your symptoms worsened or do not improve with the therapy.\n[patient]  We'll do. Thank you. I appreciate your help.\n[doctor]  You're welcome. Have a great day.\n[patient]  You too.\n[doctor]  Alright, assessment is impingement syndrome of left shoulder. Plan discussed with patient. Referral is requested for Dr. Martha Rivera to being physical therapy two days per week.",

Hello, how are you doing today?\n[doctor]  We are okay. Thank you.\n[patient]  That's good to hear. So how many days has Randy been feeling sick?\n[doctor]  Well, I would say it started around supper time last night.\n[patient]  Last night, okay, and what's been going on?\n[doctor]  Well, he started to get a runny nose.\n[patient]  Okay, does he stuffy too?\n[doctor]  Yeah, yeah.\n[patient]  And have you noticed, is his mucus clear right now?\n[doctor]  It is, it is right now, yes.\n[patient]  Pain does he also have a cough?\n[doctor]  Yes, but it's not Barkey.\n[patient]  And does he act like he has a sore throat or is he pulling on his ears?\n[doctor]  Well, I know he's been pulling on his ears. Yeah.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  You know he also, he has also been going crazy rubbing at his nose too.\n[patient]  Okay, and any fever you've noticed?\n[doctor]  I checked his rectal temperature and it was 100.3.\n[patient]  Okay, so little bit of a low grade fever there definitely, and how was his appetite? Did he eat last night?\n[doctor]  Yes, he did, yeah.\n[patient]  And how about this morning, did he eat his breakfast?\n[doctor]  This morning he ate about seven ounces from the bottle.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  And then he got another bottle and he barely ate that. I offered him cereal and he wouldn't eat that either.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  So he varies, I guess.\n[patient]  How is his energy? Does he seem like he wants to take more maps or does he have pretty good energy?\n[doctor]  It seems like he is irritable.\n[patient]  irritable because he isn't feeling good.\n[doctor]  Yeah, he is energetic, but it seems like he can't go to sleep like he is fighting it really hard.\n[patient]  Okay, just for the chart, is there anyone anybody else exposed to them who has been sick?\n[doctor]  Yes, his older sister has been sick.\n[patient]  Thank you.\n[doctor]  We also had a date with my nephew, who I learned later, had a sinus infection.\n[patient]  and what medications have you tried for him, anything at all?\n[doctor]  I've been doing the saline mist in his nose.\n[patient]  Good, that's a good choice.\n[doctor]  I did give him Tylenol really early this morning because he was warm when I took the sleeper off of him.\n[patient]  and we have the AC on in the house, but his whole body was sweating.\n[doctor]  I see and any other medications.\n[patient]  We did put some baby vix on his feet last night to try and help him breathe and I also used the humidifier. Okay, that's good.\n[doctor]  Okay, okay.\n[patient]  So there was another thing I wanted to bring up since we're here. It appears that his cradle cap has gotten a little worse. What are you using on it?\n[doctor]  I've been using the Cradle Cap brush, and then I use regular Aave No shampoo.\n[patient]  Is it a dander shampoo?\n[doctor]  No, I don't think so.\n[patient]  Okay, thank you. Well, let's complete his exam and then we will talk about the next steps.\n[doctor]  Okay, sounds good.\n[patient]  Can you take a big breath, Randy?\n[doctor]  Where's Mama?\n[patient]  Don't forget to breathe, little one.\n[doctor]  Okay, let's try the front two. Yeah, it's okay buddy.\n[patient]  Excellent! He is doing excellent! Next, let's check out those ears.\n[doctor]  Okay, let's try to make sure you don't tip all the way over. Diane, you're doing so good. Alright, ears look okay. We're gonna slide you forward so you don't bump your head when I lay you down. Hey, you're hey, you're okay, you're okay.\n[patient]  Okay, you can go ahead and sit him back up if you like.\n[doctor]  Alright, thank you.\n[patient]  Alright, so he is just kind of getting started with this, and I think we are seeing something viral right now. Often sinus infections will start out as a virus, and then we'll become bacterial infections if left alone and doesn't go away but I don't think he needs any antibiotics at least not at this point in time. Keep up with the fluids, rest and I would watch him very carefully for a barking cough. If he does get a barky cough, then that tends to be a little bit more significant, a little more severe. So if he develops a barky cough, I want you to give him a half a teaspoon of his sister's medicine. You know I'm almost tempted to give you some of the medicine because they're probably sharing the same virus.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  Actually, I will, I'll go ahead and just give you some as well.\n[doctor]  Okay, okay.\n[patient]  But if he doesn't become barky, you don't have to use it. It only works for the barky cough.\n[doctor]  We got it!\n[patient]  Okay, and we will do the same thing with him as long as nothing gets worse, and we will see him back in one week so it won't get rid of a regular cough. He can use Zarbees but use the dose for kids under a year of age. So if you want to get some of that, you can definitely try that for him. It can help out a little bit with the regular cough.\n[doctor]  I do have a question. Do you or do you not give honey to babies? Yes, that's a great question. You don't give honey to kids under a year. Instead, you can give them a gave which is a different type of nectar.\n[patient]  Now you can give honey to his older sister, that is okay, but for him it would not be very good because the stomach acid is not good enough to break down the bachelorsum spores, so it would cause him harm. You should look at the package of say honey net Cheerios it says right on there to not give it to a baby.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  Now whether that would really hurt a baby, I am unsure but it is real honey in it. So no honey for him, but a gava is definitely fine. Okay.\n[doctor]  So, Zarbe's for the stuffy nose.\n[patient]  Yes, Zarbees.\n[doctor]  And then you said which medicine to give him just in case?\n[patient]  I'm gonna give him the same medicine as his sister and just hang on to it just to watch and see. If this was a Monday and we had a whole week to watch, I would say to just call us if things got worse, but since if it's gonna be the weekend and things might worsen tonight or tomorrow, I, I would rather you have just what you need on hand.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  Right and does that make sense?\n[doctor]  Yeah, yeah, that makes sense.\n[patient]  Okay, great, and that way you don't have to share with his sister.\n[doctor]  Right, okay.\n[patient]  And since he is about half her size, we will do half the dose, which is a half a teaspoon.\n[doctor]  Okay. Will this information all be in the papers?\n[patient]  Yes, and so if he ends up starting the medicine, just give him a half a teaspoon for five days.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  Yeah, that's the only thing it won't say is as needed or anything like that.\n[doctor]  Understood. Thank you.\n[patient]  You're welcome.\n[doctor]  and the cradle cap.\n[patient]  What I would do is use something like either head and shoulders or selsen blue or niser all AD and I don't get the extra strength stuff, just use the regular strength. Chrono cap, it's just basically a fancy way of saying dandruff, so those shampoos will help get rid of it. It's not an immediate thing because they are all dead scales and you still have to brush them off, so continue to use the soft brush and some baby oil or something that will help get the scales out and those shampoos will actually help to prevent it as well. Use it two times per week, not every day but maybe twice a week, so two days between shampooing, use what you normally use any other time. And then often within six weeks or so, you will notice that the cradle cap is just not coming back anymore, but you have to be careful because it's not pH balanced for eyes, so just make sure when your rinsing is hair, you avoid his eyes.\n[doctor]  Okay, okay.\n[patient]  Alright, and if it keeps getting worse, definitely let us know.\n[doctor]  Okay, sounds good.\n[patient]  Good and since they don't have COVID-19, you can go right ahead and check out.\n[doctor]  Okay, and both appointments in a week.\n[patient]  Correct. We'll see you all then. By Randy, feel better.\n[doctor]  All right, great. Thank you so much.\n[patient]  You are welcome and have a good rest of your day.",

            "src": "[patient]  Patient is Julia Jones, date of birth, May 16, 1996. She is a new breast reduction consultant. Hello, how are you doing today? I'm Dr. Gonzalez. It's nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, ma'am. How are you? I'm doing good. Thank you. So you're here to discuss a breast reduction, correct? Yes, that's right. OK, perfect. Let me just get logged in here. Have you met with anyone before about a breast reduction? No, I haven't. OK. And how long have you been considering this? It's probably been about six or seven years, but I mean, it's always been in the back of my mind.\n[doctor]  Well, I performed a lot of breast reduction surgeries pretty much every week, so it is a very common procedure.\n[patient]  Okay, that's reassuring. Yeah, so what I want to do first is just get a little bit of history about the sort of symptoms that you're having and then I'll do a quick exam. Okay, that sounds good. And then we will talk more about the surgery and what it entails. And at this point, who is your insurance provider? Actually, my husband just accepted a new job and I will be on his plan, which I believe is not going to be blue cross, but it may be changing.\n[doctor]  Okay. What we typically do when we do a breast reduction consult.\n[patient]  document your symptoms, symptoms, we will take some pictures, then they get sent to the insurance company and what they will do is decide whether it's approved or medically necessary or not, but we want to make sure we send it to the right insurance. Do you know when you will be on a new plan? Mostly July. Okay, so we may just wait until July to submit for approval at that time. Okay.\n[doctor]  So regarding your symptoms, do you experience back pain?\n[patient]  Well, I've been going to the chiropractor for a few years.\n[doctor]  Pain here and here not painful dot when I'm walking at my desk all day.\n[patient]  Okay, and in your neck and your upper back, and how long has this been going on would you say five years, ten years, or even since puberty? I would say since I was in high school. Okay, and do you have the brush-strap indentations in your shoulders? I saw that you're wearing about a G cup.\n[doctor]  Patient regular, well-be therapy more comfortable, and that is extensive then.\n[patient]  Yeah, I have heard that as well. And have you had any children? Are you planning to have any children in the future? No, I do not have any kids now, but we might plan to in the future. Okay, and at this time, are you experiencing any numbness or tingling in the hands or any nipple pain? Sometimes yes. Okay, and rashes. Do you get any rashes underneath your breasts and it could be from sweating? No, but they're always sweaty. Okay, and then do you feel like your activities are limited because of the size? There are certain things I do when I have to hold them like working out in any jumping or running and it hurts. And it hurts. Okay, and you saw a chiropractor, but what about physical therapy for your back pain? Or do you take any pain medicine for it? No, but I do take a migraine medication per pranolol. That's okay. So let's see. I know that you have a history of breast cancer in your family. Have you had any mammograms and how old was your mother when she had it? Mom was 40 and they recommended me starting at age 30 for mammogram. I'm still, I mean I'm 25, so I'm still a little bit young.\n[doctor]  Okay, and otherwise it seems like you're really healthy.\n[patient]  Yes, for the most part, I lost about 10 pounds over the past few months and I still would like to lose about 20 more pounds. Congratulations, that's great. And then you're welcome. And so do you use any tobacco, drugs or alcohol and then you said that you're going to school or you're going to school for? I drink a little wine on occasion and for school. I'm currently setting psychology.\n[doctor]  Okay, that's great. Alright, so what we will do is we will go ahead and take a look. I'm going to take a couple of measurements and we will kind of talk about the surgery afterwards. So go ahead and stand up for me Julia.\n[patient]  Okay, so looking at the measurements, it looks like one breast is a little lower than the other. Yeah, okay. Well, thank you so much. It looks like I have all the measurements that we need. You can go ahead and cover up now. Okay.\n[doctor]  So, I think you are a great candidate for a breast reduction. When we talk about a breast reduction, what happens is that we remove the tissue out of the breast.\n[patient]  Okay, that's fine. And we would then lift them and elevate the nipple position in order to help with your back pain, neck pain. And because I'm a plastic surgeon, of course, I want them to look nice as well. Wow.\n[doctor]  So typically when you do the breast reduction, we make an incision around the nipple straight down, and then underneath, and it kind of looks like an anchor below.\n[patient]  then straight down and underneath and through that incision. We're able to lift the breast and we'll take off any extra fat and brush breast tissue. So that way it becomes smaller in size. And I noticed that you would like to be a B cup. So I do tell every patient, we can make you as small as your blood supply allows. And what that means is we must move the nipple without cutting off any of its blood supply during the surgery. Okay, well, thank you for explaining that. You're welcome. In your case, you'll probably be a small CAB cup might be a little bit small, but we'll see once I'm doing the procedure for you. Okay.\n[doctor]  And typically the surgery takes about three hours, you will have drains one in each side, and that helps prevent fluid from building up in the breast, and that stays in for about a week. And then we will remove them in the clinic.\n[patient]  And you'll have a clear plastic tape over your incision that should help with the scars. And we've seen that patients who have lighter skin, the scars will tend to be red at first. And then it takes about a year for a scar to mature in line. Okay, while I'm not too worried about the card, okay. And I do like to keep patients overnight. It's just going to be for one night in the hospital.\n[doctor]  And we just want to make sure your pain is controlled. Make sure you're not nauseated. All of that stuff. Some patients want to go home that same day.\n[patient]  But you know that some people get nauseated and the last thing that I want is for you to be vomiting at home alone without the support here at the facility. Okay, yeah, that sounds good. Okay, and then about 30% of patients say that they cannot breastfeed after a breast reduction and the reason is the breast is made up of fat. And it's also made up of a gland and the gland is what produces the milk. Okay, and so in order to reduce the size of the breast, we have to take out both the fat and the glands. So it just depends on how much is left, whether you can breastfeed in the future. And then also the breast will change over time if you gain weight. They will get larger things like that. Yeah, okay. And if you have children, they will change as well. They will enlarge especially if you can breastfeed, but they will go back down, will appear a little bit deflated. Yeah, I don't know if I'm interested in breastfeeding. Okay, the hormones of pregnancy, they will change the breast. So that's just something to be aware of and I tell all younger patients that. Okay, yeah, absolutely. And then typically, nipple sensation is fine after a breast reduction, but there's a slight chance that you will have an alteration in the nipple sensation or not have any sensation in the nipple. Generally, the nipple is just fine unless it is a massive reduction. And it's quite normal after surgery to be a little bit bruised. And then it just takes some time for that to go away. Yeah, okay. But other than that, you know most patients are very happy after the breast reduction because of the symptoms of the back pain, the neck pain. You can feel relief almost immediately. So do you have any questions Julia about the process or anything like that? No, not really.\n[doctor]  Okay, and I do think you are a good candidate for it, and I think you will benefit from it as well.\n[patient]  Good, I look forward to the release. I think you just have to do it when you're ready, when you know that you feel like it's a good time, because it is a commitment and you will have some activity restrictions for about six weeks after surgery and no heavy lifting. And I do say no driving for two to three weeks and the drain stain like I said for about a week. Okay, well I am ready as soon as my insurance is switched over. Okay, well I think from this point, if you want to, we can take photos today while you're here. All the documentation now and the note about your symptoms and that's what the insurance company is going to look for. So thank you for answering those questions. So once we have the new provider, we'll go ahead and get that submitted and then when they approve it, what the office will do is they'll work with you on a surgery date and then we'll meet again right before the surgery to answer any last minute questions.\n[doctor]  and go over the instructions in more detail and things like that.\n[patient]  Okay, well, I will notify the office as soon as I have the insurance information. That sounds great, and then we can get all in process, and it was so nice to meet you, and Catherine will be right into your photos.

Her minimum required resection based on a BSA of 2.65 with the Schnur scale is 1792 g, which should be attainable. Given her extremely large breasts and the measurements above, there is potential for using a free nipple graft.\n\nPLAN\n\nAn extensive discussion of breast reduction surgery was performed with the patient with consideration of the patient's age, co-morbidities, previous surgical history, body habitus, BMI, and smoking history. Surgical time, immediate recovery course, and longer term recovery course were discussed. Relief of the patient's current symptoms related to macromastia was not guaranteed though is expected to improve. Specific breast size was discussed, also not guaranteed. I explained the expected outcomes of using a free nipple graft such as an insensate nipple and an inability to breast feed. The patient understands that the decision for a free nipple graft will be made intraoperatively based on assessment of nipple perfusion.\n\nRisks and benefits of were discussed with the patient The patient understands the above risks, benefits and alternatives to surgery and wishes to proceed with bilateral reduction mammaplasty.\n\nThe patient will be switching to a different insurance policy in 07/2021. Once we get the new insurance information from the patient, we will submit it to her insurance company. If approved, she will return for preoperative counseling and consent.\n\nReturn to clinic prior to scheduled surgery date for preoperative counseling and consent.",

Hello Judy, how are you doing today?\n[doctor]  I'm doing good. Thank you. How are you?\n[patient]  I'm great. Thanks. So how have you been since the last time? I know the last time we were talking about decreasing your predisandos, correct?\n[doctor]  Yes, I'm just on one now, and that seems to be enough.\n[patient]  That's great to hear.\n[doctor]  Yeah, there are a couple of days there. I took an extra one just because there was a little extra pain in my feet and I do have a desk job. So when I have a day off where I'm moving around a lot, they do tend to hurt a bit more.\n[patient]  Okay, how many times did you do that?\n[doctor]  It wasn't often maybe, once a week.\n[patient]  Okay, so it sounds like we're still on track for discontinuing the prednisone. We'll do that today and you can let me know how it goes on your next visit and how about the Methatrexate. Do you think that helped with your joint pain?\n[doctor]  Yeah, definitely because I want to get my COVID shots, but from the letter I got about it, it said that it could interfere with the vaccine, you know, reduce the efficacy, so I didn't take it on the week that I got the first shot.\n[patient]  Okay, and what happened?\n[doctor]  I felt absolutely horrible until I took it again a week later.\n[patient]  I'm sorry to hear that. And... And what did you do about the second dose?\n[doctor]  Well, I called into the hotline because I was in so much pain with the first one and they said no just go ahead and take it so I did.\n[patient]  Okay, that's good then. We do have to keep an eye out on it since it's a high risk medication. Do you have an appointment to get your blood drawn for the next time?\n[doctor]  No, they didn't give me one.\n[patient]  Okay, so we can do that for you too. So what questions do you have for me, Judy?\n[doctor]  Well, I just wanted to know why I was getting all these bruises here. So like when I bump myself, I don't know where they're coming from.\n[patient]  Okay, that's probably from the Predinon zone. It can increase bruising.\n[doctor]  Okay, I didn't know that. I don't even feel it when it happens, they just show up.\n[patient]  Yeah, unfortunately that can happen, but we are working on discontinuing that. So let's see if the bruises do go away.\n[doctor]  Okay, that sounds good. Thanks.\n[patient]  Okay Judy, please sit up here and I'll take a look, shoes, and socks off please.\n[doctor]  Alright.\n[patient]  All right, let me see here. Okay, so where is it hurting in your joints right here?\n[doctor]  Yeah, a little also in my feet joints as well.\n[patient]  Okay, and how about when you bend a knee like this?\n[doctor]  Well, it hurt before we increase the methotrexate but it's doing pretty good now. Okay good. Can you flex your toes please?\n[patient]  Good range of motion also ridges and nails that's from the psoriasis.\n[doctor]  Yeah, they've been like that for a long time now.\n[patient]  Okay, alright Ms. Gomez, it looks like we are moving along with your treatment nicely. We will stop your prednisone and continue with the methotrexate. Make sure you stop by the front desk and make an appointment for the blood work, and I'll see you in three months.\n[doctor]  All right, it sounds good. Thank you so much. It was great to see you.\n[patient]  It was great seeing you too. Thank you.",

            "src": "[doctor]  Kelly Wood, date of birth February 15, 1979. Established patient here for renal ultrasound because of hematuria. Urine dipstick today negative for leukocytes, nitrates, protein, ketones, bilirubin, and glucose color yellow and clear. Eurobillenogen 0.2, pH 5.5, and specific gravity 1.020. There is a trace amount of blood in the urine and intact. Renal ultrasound impression, right kidney is 10 centimeters in length by 5 centimeters wide. There are no stones, masses, or hydronophrosis. The left kidney is 10.8 centimeters in length and 5 centimeters wide. There is a 6 millimeters left renal stone non-obstructing. 533 milliliters prevoid and 0 milliliters postvoid. Hi Mrs. Wood, I see you just finished your ultrasound.\n[patient]  Yes ma'am.\n[doctor]  Well, it looks like you have one stone in the left kidney, but it's not obstructing anything.\n[patient]  I knew it had to be a kidney stone. A past what looked like two small stones last week after I scheduled this appointment. And then for the past six weeks, I've had a few episodes of Bright Red urine, the color of like cherry coloste, and last week I was constantly having to pee, and it hurt something terrible.\n[doctor]  How bad was your pain on a scale of 0 to 10? Zero being no pain, and 10 being worst as you can imagine.\n[patient]  At the time I'd say innate.\n[doctor]  Are you having any flank pain now or tenderness in your lower back?\n[patient]  No, after passing those stones, things have felt a lot better.\n[doctor]  That's good to hear. Now, it looks like you're only taking all of it 10 milligrams a day and have no drug allergies. Is that correct?\n[patient]  That's right.\n[doctor]  Alright, well let's take a look at you today. Let's use my default pee. Well misses. Would we know that the blood in your urine was due to the kidney stones? Fortunately you passed to last week and the blood has nearly subsided. You do still have one stone in the left kidney. Since it's not obstructing or causing pain, I don't recommend any surgical intervention at this time.\n[patient]  I would like to know what I can do to stop getting these stones.\n[doctor]  As we discussed last time, the formation of kidney stones cannot be attributed to a particular cause. But several factors increase the risk, such as dehydration, family history, certain foods, digestive tract disease, and certain medical conditions.\n[patient]  Yeah, I know I don't drink near the amount of water that I should. I drink more mountain dew than anything.\n[doctor]  You should drink about half of your body weight in ounces of water a day.\n[patient]  So, if I weighed 250 pounds, I should drink.\n[doctor]  That would be 125 ounces of water a day, and you should avoid drinking sugary drinks like Mountain Dew.\n[patient]  Okay, is there any food I should need?\n[doctor]  Great question. You should avoid food rich in sodium, oxalate, and animal protein. So that would be salty, processed foods because they're high in sodium. Ideally, you should consume less than 1,000 milligrams of sodium a day and reduce the amount of beef, poultry, fish, and pork.\n[patient]  What's Oxley?\n[doctor]  It's an organic acid found in plants that when adjusted, it binds to minerals that stones are formed from foods like spinach, chocolate, beets, rhubarb and soy products.\n[patient]  Well, I'll do whatever it takes to try to avoid getting these stones again.\n[doctor]  Great, and here is a handout that you can look over. It goes over the dietary recommendations and what to avoid.\n[patient]  Okay, good. I like to have things in writing to help you remember.\n[doctor]  Perfect. Well, if you have any more questions, if you don't have any more questions, you're all set. I won't need to see you back until next year as long as you don't have any more issues like bleeding or pain. If you do have any issues, you can always call the office sooner, and if you experience any severe pain or bright red blood in your urine, you should go to the emergency room.\n[patient]  Alright, well, let's hope we don't have to do either of those and I see you next year.\n[doctor]  Yes, so let's hope. Come right this way, and I'll walk you to check out. Update P. abdomen. No flank pain and to goo. Normal vaginal exam. Primary diagnosis is hematuria. Secondary diagnosis is chronic ural thioysis.
