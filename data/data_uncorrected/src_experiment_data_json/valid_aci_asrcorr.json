            "src": "[doctor]  Hi Russell, how are you? What's been going on?\n[patient]  I've been having this sharp pain on the right side of my abdomen below my ribs for the last several days.\n[doctor]  I saw my doctor and they ordered a cat scan and said I had a kidney stone and set me to see a urologist, okay, well does the pain move or or or or go anywhere or does it stay right in that same spot yet feels like it goes to my lower abdomen and into my groin, okay, and is the pain constant or does it come and go it comes and goes when it comes it's pretty it's pretty bad. I feel like I can't find a comfortable position, okay, and do you notice any any pain when you urinate or when you pee you pee.\n[patient]  Yet it kinda burns a little bit.\n[doctor]  Okay, do you notice any blood? I don't think there is any, you know, frank blood, but the urine looks a little dark sometimes. Okay. And what have you taken for the pain? I have taken some Tylenol, but it hasn't really helped. Okay. And do you have any nausea vomiting? Any fever chills? I feel nauseated, but I'm not vomiting. Okay. Is anyone in your family had kidney stones? Yes, my father had them and have you had kidney stones before? Yeah. So I have, I've had them, but I've been able to pass them. But this is taking a lot longer. Okay. Well, I'm just going to go ahead and do a physical examination. I'm going to be calling out some of my exam findings. And I'm going to explain what what those mean when I'm done. Okay.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Okay, so on physical examination of the abdomen on abdominal exam, there is no tenderness to palpation, there is no evidence of any rebound, or guarding there is no peritoneal signs, there is positive CVA tenderness on the right flank. So essentially what that means Russell is that you know you have some tenderness over your right kidney, and that just means that you might have some inflammation there. So I reviewed the results of the CT scan of your abdomen that the primary care doctor ordered and it does show a five centimeter kidney stone located in the proximal right year eater. So this the year eater is the duct in which urine passes between the kidney and the bladder. There's no evidence of what we call hydronophrosis. This means you know swelling of the kidney, which is good means that things are still able to get through. So let's talk a little bit about my assessment and my plan okay. So for your first problem of this acute nephilothiasis or kidney stone, I want to go ahead and recommend that you push to help facilitate urination and being to help pass the stone. I'm going to prescribe oxycodone five milligrams every six to eight hours as needed for pain. You can continue to alternate that with some Tylenol. I'm going to give you a strainer that you can use to strain your urine so that we can see it see the stone when it passes and we can send it for some some tests if that happens. I'm also going to order what we call a basic metabolic panel of your analysis and a urine culture. Now I want to see you again in one to two weeks and if you're still having symptoms we'll have to discuss further treatments such as lithotripsy which is essentially a shockwave procedure in which we sedate you and use shockwaves to break up the stone to help it pass. We could also do what we call a ureteroscopy which is a small telescope small camera used to go up to the urethra and bladder and up into the ureter to retrieve the stone. So let's see how you do over the next week and I want you to contact me if you're having worsening symptoms okay okay sounds good thank you.",

For a centimeter-left upper-lobe nodule biopsy was positive for adenocarcinoma molecular testing is pending at this time all right, hello Beverly, how are you?\n[patient]  I'm good today.\n[doctor]  You're good today, you've been going through a lot lately. I know you just had your treatment, how are your symptoms?\n[patient]  My symptoms are pretty good today. I just kind of have a minimal cough and a sore throat.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  But that's all I'm feeling today.\n[doctor]  Okay, and how about fatigue? Have you been feeling more tired?\n[patient]  Yes a little bit.\n[doctor]  Okay, and how about any nausea or vomiting?\n[patient]  No not as of today.\n[doctor]  Okay, and I know you were mentioning a cough before how is it as far as walking are you having any shortness of breath?\n[patient]  I haven't noticed any shortness of breath. It just kind of seems to be a lingering kind of light dry cough.\n[doctor]  Cough okay, is it any mucus with it or is it a dry cough?\n[patient]  More dry.\n[doctor]  A dry cough okay, and tell me more about this sore throat.\n[patient]  This kind of seems to be persistent comes and goes it will be worse sometimes and then others it feels better trying to drink lots of fluids.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  To see if it can you know the dry coughing if it's part of that or what I can do.\n[doctor]  Okay, and when you mention drinking and eating, is do you feel like anything is getting stuck there?\n[patient]  Now I don't feel like anything is getting stuck right now. And I haven't been eye-opened eating, but not as much as I normally would.\n[doctor]  Okay, okay, alright, and how are you doing as far as like just emotionally and mentally how are you doing I'm just talking a little bit about your support systems.\n[patient]  The nursing staff and the office have been very good to help you know with anything that I need as far as support. So just since we were just getting started so far on the journey, I do feel like I have support and mentally you know still feel strong.\n[doctor]  Okay, and how about with family or friends have you been able to turn to anyone?\n[patient]  I do have good family members that have been supportive and they have come to my treatment with me.\n[doctor]  Okay, excellent, excellent. And so right now you're on a combination of two different chemotherapies, the sysplatin, as well as the etepo side. And you had your last treatment just a few days ago, but you're saying right now you've been able to tolerate the nausea and the fatigue.\n[patient]  Yes, I haven't had any nausea, but you know, just slight fatigue. It doesn't seem to be overwhelming.\n[doctor]  Okay, okay. So we are going to go ahead if it's okay with you and start your physical exam reviewing your vitals. So vitals look good, especially your oxygen, especially with the chemotherapy you've been getting and the cough. So your oxygen looks good. So I'm happy with that. So now I'm just examining your neck especially with your sore throat. And I don't appreciate any cervical lymphedinopathy and also no superclivicular. Add an opathy listening to your heart. You have a nice regular rate and rhythm with no. Murmors that I appreciate now on your lung exam when you're taking some deep breaths, I do notice some crackles in your lungs bilaterally. And what that means is there is some faint sounds that I'm hearing which could represent some fluid there. So on looking at your skin exam on your chest, you do have some erythema on the anterior side of the chest on the left side. And this could be related to the radiation so on your lower. Extremities I appreciate no edema and everything else looks good. And thank you. I know you did a chest x-ray before coming in so on your results for the chest x-ray. It does look like you have some mild radiation pneumonitis, which basically means some inflammation of the lungs most likely due to the radiation. So what does this all mean so for your assessment and plan? So for the first diagnosis, the first problem of the lung cancer. So what we're going to do is we're going to continue with the current regimen of your chemotherapy of the sysplatin and ediposide. Ediposide. And we're going to continue with your current dose of radiation at 45-gray. And when that's complete, we will repeat some imaging and hopefully you know the tumor will shrink down enough that we can remove it surgically okay for problem number two. So the radiation pneumonitis. So that's what causing that cough as well as some of the shortness of breath. I know you're not experiencing it much now. So what I'm going to do for that is actually going to prescribe you a low dose of prednisone. And so that's and we'll help with the inflammation. I'm going to give you 40 milligrams daily for five days and so hopefully they'll help reduce the inflammation and so that you can continue with the radiation okay. How does that sound so far?\n[patient]  That sounds great, thank you.\n[doctor]  Okay, and then lastly for the painful swallowing that you're having, so the inflammation you're having it not only in your lungs, but it also in your esophagus as well. So what I'm going to do is prescribe you your taking to the prednisone. I'm also going to give you a lidocaine swish and swallow, and you can do that four times a day, and so that will be able to help you so you can eat immediately after taking it, and it can also help so that you can continue to take food and fluids prevent dehydration. And any further weight loss.\n[patient]  Great.\n[doctor]  Okay, any questions for me?\n[patient]  I don't believe so at this time.\n[doctor]  Okay, alright, so I'll see you at your next visit.\n[patient]  Great thank you.\n[doctor]  You're welcome, and so now just...",

            "src": "[doctor]  Hey Nicholas nice to see you today your PCP looks like he sent you over for a non-healing foot ulcer on your right foot can you tell me about how long you've had that.\n[patient]  Yeah, I've had the boot for about six weeks. I first noticed it when I put on a pair of shoes that were a little bit too tight. I felt some burning and some stinging and looked down and saw a blister. I didn't think too much of it because it was on the pad of the bottom of my foot around my heel and I just had been walking on the front part of my foot. I started to notice a foul smell and my wife mentioned something to me the other day and I noticed my dog was also smelling my socks a lot and so we looked and saw that the blister had become unruft or that the top part of the skin of the blister became undone and then underneath it was just this really thick soft mushy skin that had a bad smell with some yellow drainage and so in Barbara called the primary care doctor who then got me in to see you. He started me on some antibiotics about six days ago and I never had any nausea or vomiting but my wife checked my temperature. It was about 99.7 and then at one point I had to put on an extra blanket in bed because I had some chills and when I started the antibiotics it started to feel pretty good but we've now noticed that it has turned black around the outside of the wound and I'm getting some cramping in my calf muscle as well and so there was a red streak also that was coming up the front part of my ankle along the inside portion of my calf muscle and it's super super hot and so they wanted me to take a have have you look at it.\n[doctor]  Okay, thank you for sharing that history with me, and did you complete that course of antibiotics?\n[patient]  I think he called in 10 days worth and I'm on day 6 or 7 right now I know I've got about 2 or 3 days left.\n[doctor]  Okay, and you mentioned that it had some stinging and it was a bit uncomfortable are you experiencing any pain right now?\n[patient]  Yeah, it was, it was stinging initially like I had just done something small, but at this point it's really like throbbing. It's almost like there's a fire poker in the bottom of my foot now, and then the inside of my calf muscle is really hard. And I've noticed that every time that I push that I feel it all the way up to my knee behind my kneecap, and then notice that I've been coughing a lot the last two days, and then I've noticed that I've had like difficult. Time catching my breath when I'm walking around the house. And so it's almost like two different things going on at this point.\n[doctor]  Okay, so now I see here in your record that you have some that you're diabetic and have some diabetic neuropathy, as well as your blood sugar has been running. I'm assuming kind of all over the place over the last, I'm going to say probably three or four weeks, can you tell me about that?\n[patient]  Yeah, my MA1C is 6.7, it's pretty well controlled.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  I used to be on an insulin pump and I had an A1C that at one point was like 13, but we work with an endocrinologist to get it down to where it's at now. I've been 6.7 for probably two years now and I rarely have a blood sugar that goes over 200. I check two or three times a day if I feel weird I'll check it again. But I noticed my sugars have probably been trending in the three to four hundreds of last two weeks. And then I had one spike at one point at like five or six. 100 that got our attention and I think that's also what made my wife call the primary care doc.\n[doctor]  Okay, now I know this was caused by a new pair of shoes you had mentioned before to your PCP. And he relayed this to me that you really like to go on Hikes You, and your wife have been hiking have you gone to the new trails that that were just opened up here behind the park.\n[patient]  Yeah, we actually hiked to Charlie's Bunyan about a week before this. I've had a new pair of diabetic shoes and inserts. I get those every year. I changed the inserts every three or four months. I mean, I've been in cruise control as far as that goes for some time. I did get a new pair of shoes the prosthet has told me to check my feet every day for the first week or two, which we did. I did go hiking about the third or fourth day. And I think that might be what? Caused it as I just went too far when we were hiking. But yeah, the trails or the trails are gorgeous. They're open. It's time to be outside. And I'm sort of stuck with this right now.\n[doctor]  Absolutely, yeah, my wife and I like to go back there and and hike those trails as well. So I'm going to do a quick physical exam for your vital signs. I do recognize a slight fever. However, your vitals themselves look good now on your foot exam. I do recognize the necrotic wound on your heel. As you mentioned, it is present. It's approximately two by two centimeters. I do recognize the slowing of the of the tissue as well as what looks like. Cellulitis surround the area as well as erythemia so now. Unfortunately, I do also smell the odor you are corrected as it does it as odds, but I do not appreciate any bony exposure now on vascular exam. I do have bilateral palpable pulses femurally and palpilladial pulses are present however. I don't recognize a palpable pulse door salis pedus or posterior tibial. However, I did use the Doppler and they are Presoviodoppler. Now I'm going to press on the actual affected area of the wound. Do you have any pain there?\n[patient]  I don't feel that right there.\n[doctor]  Okay, I'm going to review the results of your right foot x-ray that we did when you came in today. The good news is I don't see any evidence of osteomyelitis meaning that there is no infection of the bone. So let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for this non-healing diabetic foot ulcer. I'm going to order a test to check blood supply for this wound. Also, I'm going to do a debridement today in the office. We may have to look at. We are going to do a culture and we may have to look at different antibiotic therapy. I am concerned about the redness that's moving up your leg as well as this, the swelling and pain that you have in your calf. So we're going to monitor this very closely. I want to see you again in seven days. And then as far as your diabetes is concerned, I do want you to follow up with your endocrinologist and make sure that we do continue to keep your hemoglobin A1c below seven. And we're going to need to closely monitor your blood sugars since we're going to be doing some medication therapy with antibiotics and potentially some other medications, any other questions, comments or concerns before I have the nurse come and we're going to prep you for that procedure.\n[patient]  No, not really. So you're going to continue the antibiotics that I'm on and possibly extend or call in a new antibiotic, depending on the culture.\n[doctor]  Correct.\n[patient]  If I heard...\n[doctor]  Yep, that's correct. So what we're going to do is you said your six days and do a 10 or 12 day course. So we're going to go ahead and continue your antibiotics therapy that your PCP put you on. I do want to get the culture back and then we'll make the determination as far as additional or changing that antibiotic therapy.\n[patient]  Okay sounds good.\n[doctor]  Alright.",

The patient was referred from his primary care physician. The onset of his pain began 6 weeks ago, after wearing a pair of shoes that were too tight.\n\nToday, he describes a burning, stinging, and throbbing sensation. The patient reports a blister on the pad of the plantar aspect of his foot around his heel. He explains that he has been ambulating on the anterior aspect of his foot. He explains that the top part of the skin of the blister detached, which revealed a thick, soft, mushy skin associated with unpleasant smell and yellow drainage. The patient called his primary care physician, who referred him to our office. He was prescribed a 10-day course of antibiotics approximately 6 days ago. He experienced chills and a fever of 99.7 degrees Fahrenheit. The patient denies any nausea or vomiting. He states that when he started the antibiotics, his foot began to feel pretty good. However, he has now noticed that his foot has turned black around the outside of the wound, and he is experiencing cramping in his calf muscle as well. He also reports a burning red streak that was coming up the front part of his ankle along the inside portion of his calf muscle. While palpating his calf, he has noted stiffness in the muscle that is now up to the patella. The patient reports that he has been coughing a lot over the last 2 days. He has experienced shortness of breath with ambulation around the house. He reports that he purchases new diabetic shoes yearly and changes the inserts every 3 to 4 months.\n\nThe patient is diabetic and has diabetic neuropathy. He explains that his blood sugar has been trending in the 300 to 400's over the last 2 weeks. At one point, he had a blood sugar spike to either 500 or 600.

I see you're coming in for some right knee pain and you have a past medical history of hypertension and we will take a look at that. So can you tell me what happened to your knee?\n[patient]  Yeah, I was doing some work on my property and I accidentally slipped and fell down and I just still having some issues.\n[doctor]  Okay, well that's not good to you.\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  What part of your knee would you say hurts?\n[patient]  I would just say you know the you know it basically when I'm flexing my knee when I'm moving it up and down and I put pressure on it.\n[doctor]  All right, did you hear a pop or anything like that?\n[patient]  I'd feel something pop, yes.\n[doctor]  Okay, and did it was its swollen afterwards? Or is it looks a little bit swollen right now?\n[patient]  You're a little bit swollen, yeah.\n[doctor]  Okay, so, so far have you taken anything for the pain?\n[patient]  Just taking some ibuprofen just for some swelling.\n[doctor]  Okay, that's it. What would you say your pain score is a out of 10 with 10 being the worst pain you ever felt?\n[patient]  I would say that when I'm stationary, I don't really feel a lot of pain, but if I start doing some mobility, I would say probably a 4-5.\n[doctor]  about a 4-okay. And how long ago did you say this was, is this happened this injury?\n[patient]  It's in a week now.\n[doctor]  A week, okay. Alright, alright. So we will take a look. I'll do a physical exam of your knee in a second. But I do want to check up. You do have a past medical history of hypertension. I'm seeing here. You're on 20 milligrams of Lycine Pearl. When you came in today, your blood pressure was a little bit high. It was 150 over 70. So have you been taking your medications regularly?\n[patient]  Yes, I have.\n[doctor]  Okay, so you might have a little white coat syndrome. I know some of my patients definitely do have that. So what about your diet? I know we talked a little bit before about you reducing your sodium intake to about 2300 milligrams per per day. I know you were during the pandemic your diet got out of a little bit out of control. So how have you been doing? How have you been doing with that?\n[patient]  I definitely need some help there, I have not made some changes.\n[doctor]  Okay, yeah, we definitely need to get you to lower that salt intake, get your diet a little bit better because the hope is to get you off that medication and get your blood pressure to a manageable level. Okay, so we, we definitely can talk about that. All right, so let me take a look at your knee. I'll do a quick physical exam on you. And before I do just one, make sure you're not having any chest pain today.\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  Are you any belly pain?\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  No shortness of breath just want to make sure.\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  Okay, so I'm just going to listen to your lungs here. Your lungs are clear bilaterally. I don't hear any weasers or crackles listen to your heart. So on your heart exam, I do still hear that grade two out of six histolic ejection murmur, and you already had that. And so we we knew about that already. So let me look at your knee here. So when I press here on the inside of your knee, does that hurt?\n[patient]  A little bit.\n[doctor]  A little bit how about when I press on the outside, the outside, going to press on the outside? Is that painful?\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  No, all right, so I'm going to have you flex your knee is that painful.\n[patient]  Yeah, that's uncomfortable.\n[doctor]  That's uncomfortable and extended, so that's painful.\n[patient]  Yes.\n[doctor]  Okay, so on your knee exam, I see that you do have pain to palpation of the medial aspect of your right knee. You have some pain with flexion extension. I also identify some edema around the knee and some effusion you have a little bit of fluid in there, as well as so prior to coming in we did do an x-ray of that right knee and luckily you didn't break anything. So there's no fractures, no bony abnormalities. So let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you. So you have what we call MCL. Strain so a medial collateral ligament strain. So when you fell, I think you twisted a little bit. And so it irritated you strain that that ligament there. So for that, what we can do for you first, I'm going to prescribe you some ibuprofen 800 milligrams. And you can take that twice a day and that's going to help you with that swelling. And that pain that you currently do have, I'm also going to put you in a knee brace just to try and support those muscles to allow it to heal. And then I want you to ice the knee. You can do that for 20 minutes at a time for three to four times a day. That should also help with the swelling of your knee for your hypertension. Now I'm going to keep you on that 20 of lysinopryl, okay, because you are taking it and you're doing pretty good with it. I also want to get you a referral to nutrition just to try to help you with that diet, you know, because right now you are your diet is a little bit out of control.

So do you have any questions for me?\n[patient]  Don't need to elevate my leg or stay off my leg or...\n[doctor]  Yeah, I would say you can elevate your legs, stay off your stay off your leg, you know. If you have any kids, have them work out in the yard, instead of you just a two for a couple of weeks, it's a good thing if you want to do that.\n[patient]  Tell him this doctor's order.\n[doctor]  Tell definitely tell him, his doctor tell him I said it.\n[patient]  All right, do you have any other questions?

Hopefully you can hear me okay through the Zoom meeting what happened.\n[patient]  Well, it seems that I was outside and I fell down and was walking a bit and I did have a pain in my chest, but I didn't think anything of it and I just kept on going and then all of a sudden I'm here.\n[doctor]  My gosh, so it looks like you went into the urr and looks like they said that your ankles were swelling a little bit too and did you have some shortness of breath.\n[patient]  I did, but I didn't think anything of it.\n[doctor]  Sure, yeah, okay. Yeah, I know we've been talking through your hypertension. Looks like your blood pressure was 200 over 90. Have you been taking those meds that we have you on?\n[patient]  I have, but I miss them every year, and then so I think today I took one.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right, yeah, I have you on VUMAX COZAR and NorVask does that sound right.\n[patient]  I guess so that sounds about right.\n[doctor]  Alright, okay, yeah, you need to make sure that you're taking those consistently. That's really important. And I know that we talked a little bit about watching your diet. How have you been doing with that?\n[patient]  I've just been eating anything honestly I try to watch it here, in there. But to tell you the truth, I'd look as I was eating.\n[doctor]  Yeah, I know it's hard around the holidays and everything, but it is really important that we watch that diet. What kind of things are you eating as it is at salty foods or pizza chicken wing kind of stuff or what are you standing for?\n[patient]  A little bit of everything here, and there I do a lot of chips.\n[doctor]  Sure.\n[patient]  They're pretty good, I guess. They're salty even though the light salt ones. But...\n[doctor]  Hmm.\n[patient]  Kind of whatever I can get my hands on really.\n[doctor]  Okay, alright, how are you feeling right now?\n[patient]  I'm doing a little okay. I guess I'm just out of breath a little bit, but it's nothing I can't handle.\n[doctor]  Sure, yeah, okay. So you're taking your meds. Mostly we talked about getting you a blood pressure cuff at home. Did you end up getting one of those?\n[patient]  No, I haven't got one yet I know I needed to get one.\n[doctor]  Yeah, that's that will be good if you can take your blood pressures at home and definitely track those what about any problems with shortness of breath lately.\n[patient]  Just like I said when I was walking outside it helped a little bit, but again I just walked it off.\n[doctor]  Sure, any problem sleeping.\n[patient]  Now I sleep like a rock.\n[doctor]  Good good to hear have you had any chest pain.\n[patient]  Slightly here or there, but I thought it was just heartburn.\n[doctor]  Sure, okay. All right, let me do a quick physical exam. Your blood pressure is pretty good in the office today. It looks like it's 128 over 72, your other vital signs look good on your neck exam. There is no jugular venous distension on your heart exam. Just gonna take a listen. Here I do appreciate a two out of six histolic ejection murmur, but I heard that before, and that is stable your lungs you want to take a deep. Breath for me lungs are clear bilaterally. Now I know we talked about you stopping smoking a couple of years ago. I have here have you kept up with that.\n[patient]  I've been pretty good on it very once every week, maybe just one.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right, good to hear all right. And your lower extremities show a trace, edema, so Megan David David, I'm looking at your results of your echocardiogram that you got when you were in the ER. And it does show preserved ejection fraction of 55% and normal diastolic filling and mild to moderate mild to moderate mitral regurgitation. So let me tell you about what that means for the CHF that you were in the hospital with sounds like you know based on your diet, this is likely caused by your dietary and discretion and uncontrolled hypertension that we've been monitoring. So what I want you to do is continue your Bumex 2 milligrams. Once daily, definitely stay on top of that. Make sure that you get those meds. In every time I'm going to write you a consult to nutrition since it sounds like maybe we can give you some advice on on watching your diet, definitely watching the salty foods that you've been eating. Does that sound okay?\n[patient]  That sounds good document.\n[doctor]  Awesome way yourself daily. Do you have a scale at home?\n[patient]  No, but I can get one.\n[doctor]  Okay, good. Get a scale way yourself, Daily. Call me if you gain three pounds in two days for the hypertension that we've been treating. I want you to continue the COSAR 100 milligrams daily, continue the Norvask 5 milligrams once daily. So I'll be written down in your discharge summary, and I'm going to order a test. I'm going to order a renal artery ultrasound just to make sure that we're not missing anything there does that sound good.\n[patient]  That sounds good to me.\n[doctor]  Great, okay, David. Do you have any other questions?\n[patient]  No other questions at this time, just I guess I just need to make sure to take my medication on time that's about it.\n[doctor]  Yeah, definitely take your medication on time and see that nutritionist and hopefully we can get your diet on track as well.\n[patient]  I will do my best.\n[doctor]  Alright, thanks.

I'm just anxious about my PCP told me that I had some abnormal lab work and why she wanted me to be seen by you today.\n[patient]  Yeah, I bet that did make you nervous. I see that she referred you for a low immunoglobulin level is that you're understanding.\n[doctor]  Yeah, I mean, I don't even really understand what that means, but yeah, that's what she told me.\n[patient]  Yeah, that's a mouthful.\n[doctor]  Yeah\n[patient]  It's the one of the antibodies in your body, and that that really makes that your body makes to fight infections. It's a little bit low. I'm happy to explain it a little bit more to you. I just have a few more questions. Okay. So let's start again here.\n[doctor]  I'll do this.\n[patient]  I think I would break that.\n[doctor]  Yeah, I just saw that.\n[patient]  If you can do that.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  Yeah, so we'll just...\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  You can leave it the way it is for now. Just I think break that up.\n[doctor]  Okay, alright, so. Yeah, that sounds fine for me.\n[patient]  Yeah, I don't know why she checked these levels in the first place that you've been having problems getting frequent infections.\n[doctor]  Yeah, yeah, I had a recent physical and she did this as part of her my physical. I do tend to get infections, but I don't know I am so used to it. So I don't know if this is more than usual in the winter time. I get a lot of colds and they do seem to I always say that my colds kind of linger for a long time. But I don't know if it's more than usual.\n[patient]  Okay, how about any abdominal infections?\n[doctor]  Dieria, no.\n[patient]  Frequently.\n[doctor]  No knot that I cannot that I say can think of.\n[patient]  Okay, what about your family or anyone in your family that you know have immune deficiencies?\n[doctor]  Know my family is actually pretty healthy.\n[patient]  Okay, and how about do you have any other medical conditions?\n[doctor]  Yeah, my PCP. Just started me on Metformin. I just got diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.\n[patient]  Okay, okay, diabetes, your family, your family owns that donut shop. Write a mean down at the end of the street.\n[doctor]  Yes, and that's probably part of the cause of my diabetes, yes.\n[patient]  Yeah, well I guess you're gonna have to watch that.\n[doctor]  I know I know.\n[patient]  But, you know, everything in moderation, I mean, just you know you just need to be careful you can't doesn't have to go away.\n[doctor]  Right.\n[patient]  But have you ever needed to receive a blood transfusion or blood products?\n[doctor]  No, I actually tried to give blood, but they I didn't qualify because I had recently traveled internationally.\n[patient]  Okay, where did you go?\n[doctor]  I was in Zambia.\n[patient]  My Her that's beautiful.\n[doctor]  It's so beautiful, it's so beautiful. I had a great time.\n[patient]  Okay, well let me go ahead and do a physical examination here. I reviewed your vitals, you know that the assistance collected when you first came in, including your weight, and everything looks good there. There's no fever there. There's nothing that I'm concerned about there now on your hard exam. You have a nice regular rate and rhythm, and I don't appreciate any murmurs that's kind of those extra sounds that I would hear and that that all. Sounds good on lungs, lung, exam your lungs are. Clear there's no weasers, rals, or ronkey now on your neck exam. I don't appreciate any lymph lymphedinopathy swollen lymph glands. And then let me just go ahead and I want to press on your belly a little bit. Is that tender anywhere that I press, it doesn't seem like you're making any facial.\n[doctor]  No.\n[patient]  No, okay. So you know your abdominal exam, is your belly is soft, there is no tenderness, as I push around there now. I did review the results of your recent lab work. And it is consistent as your PCP noted with an IgA deficiency that's that immunoglobulin that we talked about. So let me tell you a little bit about the assessment and plan. So for your first problem, that an IgA deficiency is at vary. Common immunodeficiency your your body makes many different types of antibodies in one of your Z IgA is just a little bit lower than normal. Now most of the time people live their entire life without even knowing they have that deficiency and function perfectly normal. Now some people may find that they get tend to get frequent respiratory tract or sinus or abdominal infections, but this doesn't necessarily seem to be the case for you now. You can go along with other immunodeficiencies, but I think there is a low likelihood in your case, but we're going to order some additional blood. Work that includes checking those other antibodies. Now do you have any questions on what I just told you?\n[doctor]  Yes, so is there anything I need to do or should be watching for or should I be worried?\n[patient]  No, I really don't think you need to be worried now. We're going to check these additional studies, and that will give us some more guidance. But really, I think this is just a finding that's common to you. And you know, it's many people have have these type of, you know, immunodeficiency, what I want you to watch for is those infections that don't stop you have trouble getting it under control, or you know, any changes to your abdominal track, you know, severe diarrhea.\n[doctor]  Anything like that then, you know we may want to look at it a little bit further, but for now I don't think there is anything significant we want to do now go ahead and get your lab work and...\n[patient]  Bring you in for that now. The only other thing that I would say is if you eat end up needing any blood product between now and when I see you next make sure you tell them that you have that IGA deficiency.\n[doctor]  Why is that?\n[patient]  Well, there's a risk that your body can strongly react to some blood products, and they just need to know that so they're prepared. So anytime you get blood, just make sure you say that you have a history of an IgA deficiency.\n[doctor]  Okay, okay, thank you.\n[patient]  You're welcome.\n[doctor]  Okay.",

Let's just get back to our visit here. So about your line or about your tick bite. So do you notice that it's hard for you to move your knee at all?\n[patient]  Not at this time, no.\n[doctor]  No, and do you have any problems walking?\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  No, okay. And have you ever had a tick-by before?\n[patient]  I have when I was younger I used to get a lot of them because I spend a lot of time out of the woods never get into anesthesia. It takes you can get several bites out of that. But this was just one.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right, and have you ever been diagnosed with what we call Lyme disease before?\n[patient]  I have not.\n[doctor]  You have not.\n[patient]  I wouldn't know so I wouldn't know what symptoms are.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  We just asked me, I guess, maybe.\n[doctor]  Yes, so some of those symptoms like any flu-like symptoms have you like any body aches or chills or anything like that.\n[patient]  Now just really just kind of a headache, just generally don't feel well.\n[doctor]  generally don't feel well okay and has that been since the tick bite\n[patient]  It has.\n[doctor]  It has okay alright, and any other symptoms like a cough or shortness of breath or dizziness or anything like that.\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  Okay now since you are here let me just ask you a little bit about your high blood pressure. Did you buy the blood pressure cuff? I asked you to have you been checking your blood pressure at home.\n[patient]  Periodically yes.\n[doctor]  Okay, and do you think that they are running okay?\n[patient]  Yet blood pressure seems to be doing okay the Lycynoprol works well.\n[doctor]  Good I was just going to ask you if you were taking your lysinopryl so that's good okay. And any side effects from the lysinopryl since we started it, I think we started it about a year ago, two years ago.\n[patient]  No, no, no side effects that I'm aware of.\n[doctor]  No side effects, okay. And then in terms of your diabetes, are you watching your sugar intake?\n[patient]  Yeah, I usually watch it the form of high what I'm eating, but...\n[doctor]  I am a big pie fan as well I know what's your favorite type of pie.\n[patient]  Well you know it's favorite boy. I just like pie you know apples cherry chocolate you know by con.\n[doctor]  Yeah\n[patient]  I try to try to avoid the icon because I think it's just all sugar, but I do like it.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  Less.\n[doctor]  I like it too all right are you taking them at form in twice a day?\n[patient]  Not every day, but most of the time.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right. And are you checking your blood sugars pretty regularly?\n[patient]  I try to.\n[doctor]  Okay, and do you know on average how they're running are they running below like 150 or?\n[patient]  Yeah, it's definitely running below that.\n[doctor]  Okay, your blood sugars are running below.\n[patient]  It's probably with with with the Metformin, it seems to be you know on 20.\n[doctor]  Good.\n[patient]  Pretty regular.\n[doctor]  Good-your-blood sugars are running in the 120's that's really good, okay? All right, well, I want to just go ahead and do a quick physical exam, okay? So I'm looking here at your vital signs and your vital signs look really good. I do think you're doing a good job with taking your lysinoprol, your blood pressures, about 122 over 70, right now, which is right where we want it. Your heart rate is nice and slow at 67 again, which is right where we want it. And I don't appreciate any fever today. You have a normal temperature at 98 for which is really good. So I'm just going to be going ahead and calling out some physical exam findings. And I'm going to let you know what that means when I'm done, okay? So on your heart exam, your heart is in a nice regular rate. And rhythm, I don't appreciate any murmur rub or gallop on your lung exam, your lungs are nice and clear to osculation by laterally on your right knee exam. I do appreciate some erythema and edema as well as an area of fluctuation over your right patella. Now does it hurt when I press?\n[patient]  It's a little bit sore.\n[doctor]  Okay, there's pain to palpation of the right anterior knee and I'm just going to bend your knee up and down does that hurt at all.\n[patient]  No, no, it's just more of the typical grinding that I would feel.\n[doctor]  Okay, there is full range of motion of the right knee, and on skin examination there is evidence of a bull's eye rash over the right knee. Okay, so what does that mean Richard? So that means that you know you do have some area of some inflammation over the over the right knee where you where you have that tick bite, and you do have what we call that bull's eye rash, which is what we get concerned about with Lyme disease. So let's just talk a little bit about, you know, my assessment and my plan for you. Okay, so for this first problem of your of your tick bite, my concern is that you might have Lyme disease based on the presentation of your right knee. So I'm going to go ahead and start you on Doxocycline 100 milligrams twice a day.\n[patient]  We're going to continue that for about three weeks. I'm also going to go ahead and send a lime tighter, as well as a western blot, to see if you do in fact have lime-lime disease. And we'll have to go ahead and just see how you do with this, where you know I'd like to avoid intravenous antibiotics, which I think we can avoid, but I wanted to see how you do so.\n[doctor]  Do you have any questions about that?\n[patient]  Yeah, I didn't know what those last two things, or just...\n[doctor]  Yes, so we're going to start you on some antibiotics to help help you with this.\n[patient]  you know possible line disease and i'm gonna just order some blood test just to see exactly what's going on and then you know sometimes people need intravenous antibiotics because line disease can cause problems on other organs like your heart that type of thing\n[doctor]  If not treated appropriately, and sometimes we need to give antibiotics through the four, which I'd like to avoid, I think that we got this early enough that we can just treat you with some oral antibiotics okay. For your second problem of your hypertension, you know, I think you're doing a really good job. Let's go ahead and continue you on the Lycinaprol 20 milligrams once a day. And I want to just go ahead and order a lipid panel just to make sure that everything is okay with your cholesterol how. Does that sound?\n[patient]  That's fine.\n[doctor]  Great. And then for your third problem of your diabetes, I want to just go ahead and order a hemoglobin A1c and continue you on the metformin 1000 milligrams twice a day. It sounds like you're doing a good job. Since your blood sugars are running in the 120's, I don't think we need to make any adjustments, but we'll see what the hemoglobin A1c shows that gives us an idea of what your blood sugars are doing on a long term basis. How does that sound?\n[patient]  Okay, at what point time do you start kind of checking kidney function? I've been told that metformin can possibly cause some kidney issues.\n[doctor]  So can you know your kidney function? We've you know I think you've been really lucky. It's been normal I checked it about two months ago. And it looks pretty good. It looks pretty normal. But since we're doing blood work on you, I can go ahead and order a basic metabolic panel just to make sure that your kidney function is stable.\n[patient]  Okay, that'd be good.\n[doctor]  Okay, anything else?\n[patient]  Not that I can think of it this time as soon as I leave.\n[doctor]  Well, you know where to find me, okay?\n[patient]  All right.\n[doctor]  Take care bye.",

Tick bite.\n- Medical Reasoning: My concern is that he might have Lyme disease based on the presentation of his right knee.\n- Patient Education and Counseling: The patient and I discussed blood testing to determine if he does in fact have Lyme disease. I explained that Lyme disease can cause problems with other organs if not treated appropriately. We discussed that sometimes antibiotics need to be administered intravenously if oral antibiotics are not given early enough. We will see how he does with a course of oral antibiotics as I would like to avoid intravenous antibiotics.\n- Medical Treatment: Prescription for doxycycline 100 mg twice a day for 3 weeks provided. Lyme titer and Western blot will be obtained to determine if he has Lyme disease.\n\n2. Hypertension.\n- Medical Reasoning: This is well-controlled at this time.\n- Patient Education and Counseling: The patient and I discussed that he is doing really well monitoring his blood pressure at home.\n- Medical Treatment: Continue lisinopril 20 mg once a day. Lipid panel ordered to assess his cholesterol levels.\n\n3. Diabetes type 2.\n- Medical Reasoning: He is doing a good job managing his diabetes since his blood sugars are running in the 120s. I do not think we need to make any adjustments, but we will see what the hemoglobin A1c shows as that gives us an idea of what his blood sugars are doing on a long-term basis.\n- Patient Education and Counseling: We discussed that metformin can affect kidney function; however, his kidney function was last checked 2 months ago, and it has remained within normal limits.\n- Medical Treatment: Continue metformin 1000 mg twice a day. Hemoglobin A1c ordered. Basic metabolic panel ordered to assess kidney function. \n\nPatient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.",

Can you tell me about it what's going on?\n[patient]  It's not the right knee, it's the left knee.\n[doctor]  Okay, the left knee.\n[patient]  And it just happens occasionally less than once a day when I'm walking all of the sudden as kind of like gives out and I think you're going to fall. But I usually catch myself so a lot of times I have a whole grocery cart and that helps a lot. So it comes and goes and it passes just about as quickly as it comes I don't know what it is whether I step wrong or I just don't know.\n[doctor]  Okay, well, so where does it hurt like in on the inside or the outside or?\n[patient]  Internally, and it's just a whole kneecap phase.\n[doctor]  Okay, well did you hear or feel a pop at any point?\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  Like that.\n[doctor]  Have you ever had any type of injury to that, Ney? I mean, did you fall or bump it against something or?\n[patient]  No not that I can recall.\n[doctor]  Okay, and how is it painful have you taken anything for for pain?\n[patient]  No, because it doesn't last that long.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  It's just like I said, it just goes about as fast as I came in.\n[doctor]  So is it interfering with your just things you like to do? And...\n[patient]  No, not really.\n[doctor]  So I know you said that you like to do a lot of travel.\n[patient]  Yeah, I've got a trip planned here in the next month or so. And we're going down to Columbus, Georgia, to a Lions Club function, and probably be doing a lot of walking there. And they got some line dances planned. And I don't think I'll be able to participate in that because of the knee.\n[doctor]  is that where you would be kicking your leg out or something.\n[patient]  No, it's don't you know what line dancing is like dancing in theories of fairly fast moves, but it's mostly sideways motion.\n[doctor]  and is and that you think that's when your knee might give out then or just not gonna take the chance.\n[patient]  not going to take the chance\n[doctor]  Okay, yeah, that sounds like a good idea. Have you thought about even having a cane just in case or do you think that's does that happen often enough?\n[patient]  Rapid I wouldn't be able to keep track of it, so no no pain.\n[doctor]  Okay, okay. Well, so since you're in how about your blood pressure, how how is it doing, and how have you been taking your blood pressures at home like we talked about?\n[patient]  Yes, they're doing fine still about the same.\n[doctor]  So\n[patient]  Correct that whatever.\n[doctor]  So, what has it been running?\n[patient]  I can't really remember it's been several days since I took it, but I think it runs around one 20 over 70 somewhere along in there.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right. And so what about your medication? We have you on some medication for your blood pressure right?\n[patient]  Yes, I take take them regularly at 8.30 in the morning and 8.30 a night.\n[doctor]  And what is the medication and the dosage that you are taking?\n[patient]  I'm taking a farceega and amlota peen.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  and lie cina-pryl and the hydro-corthyazide. So I can't pronounce that one, so, but those are all small dosage pills.\n[doctor]  That but ya go ahead.\n[patient]  No, that was it. I just take them regularly 8.30 in the morning 8.30 a night.\n[doctor]  Yeah, well that's good. I know you said you said an alarm on your phone to make sure that you get them taken at the right time. So that's really good. And how are your blood sugars doing? How is your diet doing?\n[patient]  My blood sugar has been running a little higher at about 130.\n[doctor]  Is that in the morning when you're fasting?\n[patient]  Yes.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  And I've been told that sometimes the morning blood sugars are higher for some reason, but I don't know, I don't really worry about it, as long as it doesn't get up to extremely high cell.\n[doctor]  And are you taking your metformin?\n[patient]  Yes, yes, that's along with the blood pressure medicine morning and night.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right, so are you eating like late at night or anything like that?\n[patient]  No, we usually eat by 6.\n[doctor]  Okay, okay, all right. Well, hopefully we can get you to feeling better, okay? So I want to do a quick physical exam, really check that knee out. So your vital signs look good. They they look all right. Your temperature is 98. Two-year pulse is 72 respirations. Our 16 blood pressure is 122 over 70. So that looks fine. I'm going to go ahead and take a listen to your heart and lungs. So on your heart exam, it's a nice regular rate and rhythm. But I appreciate a slight two over six systolic ejection murmur at the left base. Here on your lung exam, your lungs are clear to consultation bilaterally. Okay, now let's take a quick look at that knee. So does it hurt when I press on it?\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  Okay, can you bend your knee and straighten it out?\n[patient]  Yes.\n[doctor]  Okay, I'm going to do some maneuvers and I'm going to just call out my findings on this okay on your right knee exam, no echimosis or edema no effusion. No pain to palpation of the left medial knee is there any decreased range of motion. Do you feel you feel like you're able to fully move that as you should the same as the other knee?\n[patient]  Yeah.\n[doctor]  Okay, so no decreased range of motion, negative, varus, and balgastast, okay. And so with your X-rays, I reviewed the result of your left knee X-ray, which showed no evidence of fracture or bony abnormality. So let me tell you a little bit about my plan. So your left knee pain, I think you just have some arthritis in that I want to prescribe some molloxacam 15 milligrams a day. We might do some physical therapy for that just too. Strengthen the muscles around that area and prevent any further problems with that okay. And so for your second problem, the hypertension. So I want to continue the lysinoprol at 20 milligrams a day and order an echocardiogram just to evaluate that heart murmur all right. And\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  For the diabetes mellitus, I want to order a hemoglobin, a one C to C if we need to make any adjustments to your metformin, and I'm also going to order a lipid panel. Okay, do you have any questions?\n[patient]  Now I don't think so when will all this take place?\n[doctor]  We will get you scheduled for the echocardiogram. I will have my nurse come in and we will get that setup okay.",

And how does that feel here?\n[patient]  that hurts.\n[doctor]  Okay, sorry, there is tenderness of the greater tuberosity of the humerus, but there is no tenderness at the sternoclavicular or acromioclavicular joints you have good hand grips all right. And then now on your neurovascular exam of your left arm, your capillary refill is less than three seconds and your sensation is intact to light touch all right. So what does that all mean? Well, firstly, let me go ahead and take a look at your results of your shoulder x-ray here. Now I reviewed the results and there are no fractures. So that's good. So let's go ahead and talk about my assessment and plan here, Wayne. So for your problem of left shoulder pain, your symptoms are most likely due to a rotator cuff tendonopathy. So this means that you injured the tendons of the muscles that help make up your shoulder muscles. So I will be ordering an MRI for your left shoulder to be sure that there is nothing else going on with your shoulder okay.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Now I'm also going to refer you to physical therapy for approximately six to eight weeks, and during that time you may also continue to take Tylenol. Now, if your symptoms don't improve, we can consider a steroid injection for your shoulder, which can provide some relief to have any questions about your plan at all.\n[patient]  So do you think this pain will ever go away?\n[doctor]  Now while many patients are very successful with the physical therapy, those will those help strengthen, you know, they do a lot of strengthening exercises with you to help strengthen you know your muscles so that it's not your movements, not always relying on those joints predominantly. So we're going to go ahead and start with that and then see how you do okay.\n[patient]  Okay, okay.\n[doctor]  Alright, okay. Well, do you have any other questions for me?\n[patient]  No, I think that's it.\n[doctor]  Okay, well I'm going to have the nurse check you out and she's also going to give you some educational materials on the physical therapy and what to expect and and then go ahead and schedule a follow up with me as well after you do your physical therapy okay.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Alright we'll have a good day.\n[patient]  Okay, you too.\n[doctor]  Thanks.\n[patient]  Okay, bye.",

Or is it just best to keep it like down?\n[patient]  It's good if I keep it a little bit above my like a little, I guess a little bit like around my like just a regular level like if you're typing or something and then I just put it on a pillow and I just let it stay straight like I feel better.\n[doctor]  Okay, yeah, no, I don't think I understand completely, okay? So I took a look at your vitals and your blood pressure is a little elevated, but honestly, that's probably to do with the pain right our body can respond to pain. In that way, we are looking at like 140 over over 70, it's not anything crazy. But something to mention, I see that your heart rate is also a little elevated at like about like 80 beats a minute. You're not running a fever. So that's great. Look at 90, 90, 7. To your respiratory rate is pretty normal at like 20, so before we came and I know that we had you do an X-ray. And I'm sure that that was a bit more painful because we had to do so many manipulations. But I do want to note that you are positive for what we call a coles fracture. What that means is that the joints between your wrists, like the bones, between your wrist, that there is evidence of AA fracture. And we are going to have to treat it a little conservatively at first. And then consider some of the options options that are available to us. So for your primary diagnosis of a coles fracture, we are going to give you a thumbs spike up for today. And that's going to...\n[patient]  I'm sorry.\n[doctor]  pardon what?\n[patient]  O32,\n[doctor]  We're gonna brace you, we're gonna give you a brace.\n[patient]  Okay, thank you.\n[doctor]  Sorry, no problem. Sorry. Yeah, not a thumbs spike. Oh, we're going to brace your arm and you're going to have that we have a couple of options. But I think the best course of action is going to be for surgery. We will in the meantime give you pain medication. I want to put you on 50 milligrams of ultram every six hours. And then I also want to get you on get you into physical therapy a few weeks after surgery. This is going to be just a normal procedure. You will be in for an overnight stay. But after that once we assess and make sure that everything is good, you'll be able to go home. Okay.\n[patient]  When do I have to have the surgery?\n[doctor]  We would like it to happen as quickly as possible. You know your body is a wonderful miracle. And it's going to start trying to heal on its own. What we need to do is get your wrist straight. And then like put screws in to make sure that we hold it in place or else it could like heal and malform.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Alright, so what?\n[patient]  How long do I have to wear that brace?\n[doctor]  You're gonna be wearing the brace for about six weeks.\n[patient]  6 weeks.\n[doctor]  Yeah, so you're going to come in for your surgery, we're going to perform it, you're going to stay overnight. And then you'll be bracing it for six weeks in the meantime, you'll also then go to physical therapy. I want you there like we're going to do an assessment and determine how much, but I'm thinking probably three times a week just to make sure that you can get your wrist as strong as possible to prevent like future injury. Now the cool thing about getting any kind of a bone break is that your your body comes out even stronger. So this shouldn't happen again. But unfortunately, like it's these situations that uf that just kind of\n[patient]  Oof.\n[doctor]  These deform these deformities that really that really kind of hurt is the short version. All right, no problem. Any other questions?\n[patient]  No, while I'm going on vacation, do I need to cancel it like can I still go even with the I mean after the surgery?\n[doctor]  Yeah\n[patient]  Do it as soon as possible, I'm going to vacation in a month so.\n[doctor]  Okay, how long is the vacation?\n[patient]  It's only for like a couple weeks.\n[doctor]  Okay, well, so you might have to postpone it just because depending on what physical therapy says, right, if they feel that you can sustain, if you can like sustain the exercise as while you're gone, that if there's something that you can do by yourself, then you should be fine. But we do want to give it you said that it's going to happen in a couple of weeks.\n[patient]  No vacation in a month.\n[doctor]  Okay, okay. Yes. So how about in a month we come you come back? Let's do a checkup again, see where we are at, and then we can assess whether or not this is something that I would recommend you do.\n[patient]  That sounds good, thank you.\n[doctor]  No problem, bye.\n[patient]  Bye.\n[doctor]  The fracture appears extraarticular and usually proximal to the radial ulnar joint dorsal angulation of the distal fracture fragment is present to a variable degree if dorsal angulation is severe presenting with a dinner fork to formate ulnar's styloid fracture is present.",
            "tgt": "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nRight wrist injury.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nDiana Scott is a pleasant 61-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of a right wrist injury. The patient sustained this injury yesterday morning, 05/12/2022, when she slipped on the stairs while carrying a laundry basket. She states she tried to catch herself with her arms outstretched. The patient reports an immediate onset of pain and swelling in her right wrist. She denies any previous injuries to her right arm. The patient rates her pain level as a 9/10. Her pain is aggravated by movement. The patient also reports numbness and tingling in her fingers. She has been icing and wrapping her right wrist with an ACE wrap. The patient has also been taking ibuprofen, which provides some relief. She notes fully extending her arm while resting it on a pillow alleviates some of her pain as well.\n\nThe patient is going on vacation in 1 month.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nMusculoskeletal: Reports right wrist pain and swelling.\nNeurological: Reports numbness and tingling to the digits of the right hand.\n\nVITALS\n\nBlood Pressure: Elevated at 140/70 mmHg.\nHeart Rate: 80 beats per minute.\nRespiratory Rate: 20 breaths per minute.\nBody Temperature: 97.2 degrees F.\nHEAD: Normocephalic\nNECK: No swelling noted\nCV: No bilateral lower extremity edema. No carotid bruit. No murmurs, gallops or rubs heard during auscultation of the heart. Palpabale pulses to the bilateral lower extremities.\nRESPIRATORY: Normal respiratory effort no respiratory distress. Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.\nGI/GU: Non-distended\nBACK: No evidence of trauma or deformity\nNECK: No adenopathy. No thyromegaly.\nMSK: Examination of the right wrist: Limited range of movement. Tenderness to palpation. Pain on flexion and extension. Pain with radial deviation and lateral deviation. Pain with wrist abduction and adduction. The metacarpals are intact. Obvious swelling and bruising. Tenderness on palpation throughout. There is evidence of potential fracture feeling and bony crepitus.\n\nRESULTS\n\nX-rays of the right wrist were taken today. These reveal the fracture appears extra-articular and proximal to the radioulnar joint. Dorsal angulation of the distal fracture fragment is present to a variable degree. Dorsal angulation is severe, presenting with a dinner fork deformity. An ulnar styloid fracture is present.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nRight wrist Colles fracture.\n\nPLAN\n\nAfter reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have discussed with the patient that her x-rays revealed a right wrist Colles fracture. We discussed treatment options and I have recommended that we proceed with a right wrist ORIF and all indicated procedures. We reviewed the risks, benefits, and alternatives of the surgery. I explained that we should schedule the operation for as soon as possible to ensure adequate healing and to limit malformation of the wrist. I advised that this procedure will require her to be admitted to the hospital for an overnight stay.\n\nIn the meantime, the patient will be placed in a thumb spica brace and receive instructions on its proper usage. I have prescribed the patient Ultram 50 mg every 6 hours to treat her pain. We also discussed that her postoperative course will include wearing a brace for 6 weeks. A few weeks after surgery, the patient will initiate formal physical therapy and will attend 3 times per week to strengthen her right wrist. The patient has a 2-week vacation planned in 1 month. I recommended that we consult with her physical therapist to determine if there are exercises she can perform on her own instead of postponing her vacation.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nThe patient will follow up with me in 4 weeks status post surgery to discuss her progress.\n",
