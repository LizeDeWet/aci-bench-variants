He is a 49-year-old with hypertension and palpitations, please copy forward his thyroid profile from March 1st. 2021, Mr. Roberts doing today. I'm fine. Thank you. Good. So I saw you were recently in the emergency room with high blood pressure and some palpitations. Yeah, that was back in March. I think but my girlfriend and I we talked about it. And on that day, I had a few cups of coffee and no breakfast. So I think it was probably more of a panic attack than anything else since so tell me about the blood pressure issues my blood pressure since I was young family history of this family does have high blood pressure I see.\n[patient]  Yeah, I thought I was getting better and have a new primary doctor and she put me on a new medication about a month ago.\n[doctor]  Can you tell me which medications you're taking?\n[patient]  My new med is a combo med something 4025.\n[doctor]  Okay, yes, this is at your chart, the Benacar HCT. It has hydrochlorothiazide in it. Yet that's set my water pill. I call it okay. Are you still taking the M. Lodipine? 10 milligrams daily. Yes, I am.\n[patient]  That's a good start, Regimen. Are you checking your blood pressure at home? And if you ask what numbers are you seeing?\n[doctor]  Every day.\n[patient]  Awesome!\n[doctor]  Yeah, every morning I take it when I get up and been running about 146 to 155 lately. Not down in the 120's yet, no not yet while we are trying to get there though, okay? How are you doing with your salt and take charted back off of it? I think I'm doing good with it, not eating too much good. I play huge part in lowering your pressure and staying away from salt is important information on that. Eating plan, which is the only eating plan that has been shown to lower blood pressure, sounds good are you doing any exercise? I do try and walk on the treadmill when I can okay great so let's take a look throughout your exam. Just like you make sure I get everything documented okay. Please use my general physical exam template. Let me take a listen to you and make sure everything sounds good.\n[patient]  Alright.\n[doctor]  Your heart and lungs sound good so that's great.\n[patient]  Good to hear.\n[doctor]  All right, go ahead and lie down and let me know if anywhere I press hurts. No, nowhere. All right, so I'm going to take a look at your ankles and feet. I'm just going to look for some swelling.\n[patient]  Alright.\n[doctor]  So in terms of getting that pressure down, you're on three meds that are maxed out and your blood pressure is still not down. And the question is what do we need to do to get your?\n[patient]  to get it down. Your potassium one week ago was 4.0 has been redone since in the last week.\n[doctor]  No. Okay, for as good for your potassium level, some people have what is called resistant hypertension that is driven by something else in the body often. It is a four response if I were to take 10 people under the age of 50 who have high blood pressure, who developed it at a young age 8 out of 10 would respond to reduce salt in their diet with a lower blood pressure. But for the two out of 10, there is something else driving parathyroid. Levels or something called your adrenal glands over produce. Aldosterone, which we call hybrilosterone, okay. So is there something we can do about it in these cases? There is medicine called spironylactone that is very effective at dropping the aldosterone level and your blood pressure. And I think we should give that a try. I mean, I'm willing to give it a try, okay. So let's discuss the piss of the possible risks of being on hydrochlorothyazide, thyazide, which is the fluid meds that you're now on. And the spironylactone, one issue is that they can affect your electrolyte balance. They can also cause dehydration. So when as you got to make sure that you hydrate, you do not hydrate and you get dehydrated, you will know it because you will get dizzy standing up second thing is this spironylactone can raise your potassium too far as rare. But it can your starting with your potassium at four. So that gives us some room to feel a bit better. And then the third thing is that spironylactone combined with hydrochlorothyazide, chlorothyazide, can cause your sodium. Levels to go down now. This does not meet mean that you need to be eating more salt, okay. But it does mean that you will need to do blood test in two weeks to make sure that it's okay. All right, that I can do, are there any other side effects I need to worry about?\n[patient]  Disney is possibly as well as one and 100 guys might develop.\n[doctor]  Tenderness in the chest, swollen breasts are enlarged breast. This is a rare side effect called gynecomastia. And if it happens, you just cut the medication. And you let me know, but it is very uncommon.\n[patient]  I'll definitely let you know that happens okay. We'll keep working at it until your blood pressure gets better. It can be tricky and your blood pressure starts to go up at a young age.\n[doctor]  Though it is important to get it under control because it can lead to your heart getting bigger or in large same thing that happens when you lift weights and your muscles get bigger. And if your heart pumps against high blood pressure can eventually lead to heart failure.\n[patient]  I understand.\n[doctor]  Yes, of getting that under control is really important to help prevent kidney failure strokes, and things like that that you are at high risk for with high blood pressure, okay? The American Heart Association has a website called Heart that IT has a lot of really good information about blood pressure to teach to teach you about it, and how to control your diet with exercise treadmill routinely for 30 minutes or so most days that could be 7 to 10 points of your blood pressure really relieve gait is very important to be active lower your salt, and increase your potassium the goal is to keep your salt under. 2,000 milligrams a day the actual recommendation is is 1,500 milligrams per day, but most people have a hard time with that so just take a look at the website and the diet information that will give you a lot of tips and information to help you start learning stuff I'll definitely check that out so we will try this Spuronal Actone and schedule follow-up in two weeks to check your blood pressure and electrolytes if the new med doesn't work the next step is going to be the resistant hypertension clinic so they will look into secondary causes of your hypertension they have access to newer procedure-based technologies that can lower your blood pressure without medication for example there is something called a renal denervation where they go inside the artery that feeds your kidney with almost like a little coil and heat that artery up when they do that they can block the nerve endings that get into your kidneys and lower your blood pressure that's interesting\n[patient]  Yeah, so that procedure has been shown to lower blood pressure by 10 points there are of course some risks. So, not everyone is a candidate, but we will cross that road when we need to and let's just...\n[doctor]  Medication whisper we will see you in two weeks then sounds good thanks doc you're welcome any questions will do\n[patient]  Have a great day, Mr. Roberts.\n[doctor]  You too.\n[patient]  Mr. Roberts presents with resistant hypertension. He is on three meds and maximum dose.\n[doctor]  I have added spironal acdown to his regimen. We will need to monitor his potassium and sodium. He'll have a basic metabolic panel and blood pressure check in two weeks. Next medication would be carvedilol, which I have tried to avoid, given its potential for erectile dysfunction, I have talked to the patient about that, and the potential side effects of spironal acdown, including the gynecomastia and electrolyte disturbances, if he is not controlled on spironal acdown, the next step would be sending him to resistant hypertension clinic.",
            "tgt": "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nHigh blood pressure and palpitations.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nJordan Roberts is a 49-year-old with a long history of hypertension and an acute episode of palpitations.\n\nIn March, Mr. Roberts went to the emergency room for palpitations and hypertension. He attributed this to a panic attack, but also stated he consumed several cups of coffee on an empty stomach the morning of. He denies additional episodes of palpitations.\n\nHe has been monitoring his blood pressure at home daily, obtaining systolic blood pressure readings of 146 to 155. He does report a family history of hypertension. Additionally, he has been monitoring his salt intake and feels he is doing well at reducing it. He also walks on his treadmill as often as he can.\n\nHe has a new primary care physician who started him on a new medication Benicar HCT, which he has been using for the past month.\n\nPAST HISTORY\n\nMedical\nHypertension.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY\n\nSeveral family members positive for hypertension.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS\n\nBenicar HCT 40 mg/25 mg\nAmlodipine 10 mg daily.\n\nPhysical Examination\n\nCardiovascular\nNormal rate, regular rhythm, S2 normal, normal heart sounds, and normal pulses.\n\nPulmonary/Chest\nBreath sounds normal. \n\nAbdominal\nThere is no tenderness.\n\nMusculoskeletal\nThere is no edema.\n\nRESULTS\n\nThyroid profile 03/01/2021.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\n\u2022 Resistant hypertension.\n\nMr. Roberts presents with resistant hypertension, with systolic blood pressure readings between 146-155. He is currently on maximal doses for 3 medications.\n\nPLAN\n\nI have added spironolactone to his regimen which will require monitoring of his potassium and sodium. We will schedule him for a follow up in 2 weeks to complete a basic metabolic panel and check his blood pressure. Next medication to consider adding is carvedilol. I have tried to avoid this, given the potential for issues with erectile dysfunction. I counseled the patient about spironolactone side effects, including gynecomastia and electrolyte disturbances, as well as his increased risk of dehydration, with one sign to watch for being dizziness. If we are not able to improve his blood pressure with spironolactone, the next step would be sending him to the resistant hypertension clinic.\n\nI provided and reviewed with Mr. Roberts the American Heart association website (heart.org) and encouraged him to access for tips on lowering his salt intake and increasing his potassium intake. His maximum salt intake should be 1500 to <2000 mg per day. He was provided materials to follow the DASH diet and encouraged to meet 30-min of walking most days.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nSchedule follow up appointment in 2 weeks for blood pressure check and basic metabolic panel. Reduce sodium intake to 1500 to <2000 mg per day. Follow DASH diet.\n",

            "src": "[doctor]  MRN 492-82721. Patient's name is Jacqueline Miller. Use last visit exam where appropriate. Hi, how are you doing Jacqueline?\n[patient]  I'm pretty good. How are you?\n[doctor]  Good as well. So it sounds like we are under good control right now.\n[patient]  Yes, it's doing much better.\n[doctor]  Good good. Do you have any rash left over?\n[patient]  Yeah, I have a small bit left over. I started using Doxocyclein only once a day because I think the pharmacist said if it's getting better to just limit it to once a day.\n[doctor]  Okay, that sounds good.\n[patient]  But I was taking it twice a day and I did notice a lot of improvement.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  And then when I started doing it only once a day, it seems the same and it's not continuing to get better. So it's kind of plateaued a little bit.\n[doctor]  I see are you breastfeeding at this time?\n[patient]  No, not right now.\n[doctor]  Okay, good. So you should not be breastfeeding while you're on that medication.\n[patient]  Yeah, actually I stopped breastfeeding and then asked for the docks of cycling at that time.\n[doctor]  Okay, even with the doxocycline, you can keep using the ELide L.\n[patient]  Okay, and I didn't take the Eli Dell because when I read about it, I got worried. So I wanted to just try the docks of cycline and see. Okay, so we can talk about the Eli Dell. A lot of the things you read about is not actually relevant to the cream or ointment form, but it's about the oral form that's used in really high doses long term after people have a heart transplant or a kidney transplant or something like that. Okay, I didn't realize that.\n[doctor]  Yeah, and when you suppress the immune system that hard for that long, it can predispose you for developing cancers like hematologic type cancers. It doesn't apply to as needed use of the medicine, a cream or an ointment, okay?\n[patient]  Okay, then I can resume taking the docks of cycling twice a day again.\n[doctor]  So let me clarify, what exactly are you using? And then we will look at you and figure out, okay? So you're using the sulfacetamide wash, how frequently are you using that one?\n[patient]  twice a day.\n[doctor]  Okay, and that's not drawing you out too much.\n[patient]  No, that's fine.\n[doctor]  Okay, and you're using the metro cream?\n[patient]  Yes.\n[doctor]  How often are you using that one?\n[patient]  After my face wash, I immediately apply the cream.\n[doctor]  Okay, and then are you using any other kind of lotions or anything?\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  So you're not using the cedarful cleanser?\n[patient]  I'm not.\n[doctor]  Okay, and no Neutrogena wipes.\n[patient]  No wipes.\n[doctor]  Okay. And then what about any lotions that you're using?\n[patient]  I'm not using any lotion right now, just those two.\n[doctor]  No lotion, okay. So that may be something else we should add in a lotion to just help moisturize, but we will see.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  And then again, when did you go down to just taking the doxocyclein once a day?\n[patient]  That was last week, so the first two weeks I did twice a day.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  And then I started seeing improvement and then I changed it just once a day.\n[doctor]  Okay, let me take a look at your face here. I'm going to describe for the transcriptionist what I'm seeing your fit spatic skin type. For meaning you're not going to burn, you're going to suntan essentially 4 to 5.\n[patient]  And then on bilateral medial cheeks, there are a few really faint, erythematous papules and just maybe a little bit of redness around and underneath your nostrils. So you're right. It's not totally gone. Yeah.\n[doctor]  I think I would go ahead and go back to twice a day, every day with the docks of cycling.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  But I would pick up the E-Lite L2.\n[patient]  Okay, I can do that.\n[doctor]  I mean I have known risks associated with medications. Topicals are usually safer and preferable to oral medications. With that being said, doxocycline is low risk.\n[patient]  It is okay.\n[doctor]  The doxocycline can give you bad upset stomach or heartburn. It will make you sunburn even if you never sunburn so you have to protect yourself.\n[patient]  Yeah, I mean I feel sunsensitive whenever I go out. So I'm taking all the precautions with wearing a hat and all that.\n[doctor]  Great! I just wanted to make sure you knew about that.\n[patient]  Yes, I did. Thank you.\n[doctor]  Alright, but I think to help get rid of it sooner rather than later, if insurance will cover the Eli doll, pick it up and start using it.\n[patient]  Yeah, I did check the insurance is not covering it.\n[doctor]  It's not okay.\n[patient]  Well, let's look around really quick because if you use Gooders coupon, it will be around $30 to $40 or something. Okay, let's see. So with your coupon, it was around $850 or something. Yep, that's way too much. I agree. And because I also looked at the Urethra that you recommended in my notes, and if it is still expensive, I could try that instead.\n[doctor]  Yes, so it actually, it is actually more expensive. I think the prices fluctuate.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Because now it's showing the cheapest of $70 and when I looked before, it was around $30 to $40.\n[patient]  Yeah, if it was around $200, I would have picked it up, but it was coming to around $850 after insurance.\n[doctor]  Okay, so instead of the cream form, we could try ointment form.\n[patient]  You mean the Taker Millius?\n[doctor]  Yeah, I'm in.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  So, if we send it to pick and save the metro market, let's see where else.\n[patient]  Can you do the metro market?\n[doctor]  Yeah, let me put in the prescription and we'll see what we can find.\n[patient]  Sure.\n[doctor]  Pharmacy is what I'm trying to say.\n[patient]  Okay, but it's not a steroid, right?\n[doctor]  Correct, it's not a steroid.\n[patient]  Okay, good.\n[doctor]  It's called a calcaneurin inhibitor. It's kind of like a steroid, and then it calms inflammation.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  But it's not a steroid, so don't use steroids on your face for sure as they'll make this kind of rash worse. But also steroids carry the risk of causing thinning of the skin.\n[patient]  Alright.\n[doctor]  These medications don't cause thinning in the skin, and they're not going to cause some other kind of rash. The thing to know is that sometimes 5-10 minutes after you put it on, it can cause this weird kind of tingly or needle-like sensation. Or make it redder or flush, but it should only last a few seconds and then go away. It's not analogy or anything bad.\n[patient]  Okay, got it.\n[doctor]  So it only lasts a couple of seconds. It doesn't mean it's going to happen again. It's nothing bad. It will still work, so keep using it as long as you know you can stand it, okay?\n[patient]  Okay, thank you for explaining.\n[doctor]  So I will say apply to rash on face, twice daily, until resolved.\n[patient]  Okay, so only apply to the rash area.\n[doctor]  Yes, and keep using the face wash.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  I think you could just do it once a day. I don't think you need to do it twice a day just because I don't want to dry your skin out too much, okay?\n[patient]  I never noticed that my face is dry or got thin. I feel so good after using it.\n[doctor]  I understand, but it could get dry and I don't want to create other problems for you.\n[patient]  Alright, I would just wash one today with it, but it was feeling very good like there is this little bit of moisture getting back in with the other wash when I would use it twice a day. I was drying out, but not with this one.\n[doctor]  I see. Okay. Well then do what feels good. If you do notice that you're starting to get dry, then reduce to once per day.\n[patient]  That sounds good.\n[doctor]  So, to review continue using the same face wash, continue with metro cream and increase the use of ducts acycline to twice a day.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  and then just do it until it's gone and then do it once a day for another week before stopping.\n[patient]  Okay, sounds good.\n[doctor]  All right, and I'll rewrite your instructions here.\n[patient]  Thank you so much.\n[doctor]  If there are any other questions or you're getting different instructions, feel free to reach out to me and we'll clarify. Okay?\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  But in general, Doxocycline is such a low risk. We're not going to have you on this forever, and especially since we're adding the tachyrilitis, I expect it will clear quickly.\n[patient]  Sound good.\n[doctor]  Alright, and I just want to really help knock it out as fast as possible since you've been dealing with it for so long now. I would take it twice a day until it's gone, and then once a day for a week before you stop. I'll write that out like that, so twice a day until rash is gone, and then once a day for another week before stopping.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Once the rash stops, you can stop the tachyriline misointment. Continue doxocycline another week, and then stop, but you can keep using the wash and the metro cream.\n[patient]  Okay, that sounds good. I can do that.\n[doctor]  and then hold off until I see you again before you start back any of your old products. If it's starting to flare again.\n[patient]  If it's just a little bit, you can try just doing the tack relime as for a couple days to see if that's enough. If it's not, then restart the doxocycline as well. Alright.\n[doctor]  I don't expect that to happen, but you know if it does, you have the tools then you will be seeing me for a follow up, we can figure out what to do next. I would say if it's getting worse rather than better, just give me a call or send me a my-car message, okay?\n[patient]  Yes, sound good.\n[doctor]  Do you have enough refills?\n[patient]  Yeah, I think so.\n[doctor]  Okay, so it looks like you have another refill of the doxocycline, so you're good there. Metro cream, you probably still have enough of that one.\n[patient]  Yes, I do.\n[doctor]  Alright, and I'll cancel the E-Lite L-cream just so we don't complicate your list. You have plenty of the face washed all.\n[patient]  Yes.\n[doctor]  Okay. I will get rid of the Clinton Mison from your list as well.\n[patient]  And what would you suggest for a moisturizer?\n[doctor]  Yeah, so for that I would do something really basic like the nickrime, or even if it's just really dry, you could use a little bit of petroleum jelly. I'll give you a couple samples, okay? Let's make sure we have a follow up in about four weeks.\n[patient]  Okay, thank you.\n[doctor]  Okay, and I would stay away from any kind of anti-aging thing, any kind of plant thing. Really, let's just be sure we talk about any new products. So reach out to me if you're going to try something else. Let's go get those samples.\n[patient]  Okay, that sounds good.\n[doctor]  For assessment and plan, parallel dermatitis, Rosacea including ocular rosacea and copy and paste her patient instructions. I recommend that she gently wash her eyelids once a day with gentle cleanser such as vignic cream. Also use Bruder Mask as needed.",

Her history includes significant alcohol used to sort her and my mild hypercholestrolemia. At last visit on April 16, her blood pressure was 130 over 90. After presenting at 150 to 100, she was prescribed hydrochlorothiazide, 12.5 milligrams by mouth once daily, and lysiniprol 20 milligrams by mouth once daily. CMP and CBC were essentially unremarkable.\n[doctor]  Hi Miss Taylor, how are you today?\n[patient]  Hi, I'm good, thank you.\n[doctor]  Thanks for coming in today.\n[patient]  Yeah, no problem.\n[doctor]  So, how have things been going for you?\n[patient]  They have been alright. I'm struggling with not drinking. I wanted to discuss that shot that you had mentioned last time, but we didn't get to discuss it too much.\n[doctor]  Okay, well I will be happy to provide you with more information. So tell me when did you last have a drink?\n[patient]  on Monday.\n[doctor]  Okay, so you've gone a couple of days without it?\n[patient]  Yeah, yeah, I have.\n[doctor]  Yeah, and how'd you been drinking for a while?\n[patient]  Yep.\n[doctor]  How much had? How much had you been drinking?\n[patient]  for five times a week, hard alcohol, so you know.\n[doctor]  Okay. Well, it will certainly help your blood pressure if you are able to stop drinking.\n[patient]  Yeah, yeah, I agree with you.\n[doctor]  Okay, are you taking your blood pressure medications?\n[patient]  Yeah, but I'm only taking half of the light's centipril.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  While the first time I took it, I felt the thargic and tired, so only took a half dose the next time. I felt much better and I didn't have the headaches or the swishing that started in my left ear. So I feel like it's definitely helping, but I don't know, but I know it's not going to be okay until I stop drinking.\n[doctor]  And are you also taking the full dose of the hydrochlorothiazide? Do you have any chest tightness or pressure or any shortness of breath?\n[patient]  Yeah, I'm taking the full dose of that medicine too, and no, none of those symptoms.\n[doctor]  Okay, anything else I should be aware of or that we should be checking?\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  Okay, good. Are you doing the blood pressure checks at home?\n[patient]  Yes, yes I am.\n[doctor]  Okay, good. What kind of numbers are you seeing?\n[patient]  Well, in the morning I'm seeing lower numbers than in the evening where I run anywhere from like 130 to 145 or 150 slash 95 dash 100 on the bottom.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  But in the evenings if I sit there for a while and then take it, it goes down. Kind of like when I come here, it's always high, but then it goes down. In the mornings, it's generally more normal where it's supposed to be.\n[doctor]  Ugh.\n[patient]  I'm also I'm taking my medicine in the morning when I get up instead of in the evening.\n[doctor]  Yes, so it sounds like we are not too far out of where we want to be.\n[patient]  Right.\n[doctor]  Okay, well let me get a listen to your heart, go ahead and hop up here.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Use my general exam template. All right, go ahead and take some deep breaths. Okay, good. Any fever, cough, shortness of breath, or sore throat? No. Any recent travel or contact or exposure to the coronavirus?\n[patient]  Nope.\n[doctor]  Have you received your coronavirus vaccine?\n[patient]  Yes, on February 9th.\n[doctor]  Okay, great alright, well I'm just going to look at your ankles and feet. I'm looking for any signs of swelling.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Alright, well, everything looks good. You can go ahead and sit up Miss Taylor. Alright, so the good news is everything is looking okay. I think we both agree if you were able to stop drinking. Your blood pressure would cease to be an issue for you. Yeah, I agree with that. They will let us discuss the potential medicine to help you with that. What it does is it blocks some of the brain receptors that alcohol stimulates, and it tricks the brain into thinking it does not need alcohol thereby cutting down the urges.\n[patient]  be urged to drink or they constant thinking about it.\n[doctor]  It actually will help with both.\n[patient]  Okay, so is it like a one-time thing?\n[doctor]  Generally, the shot is given about once a month. It can also be given as a daily pill, but the shot does tend to work a bit better.\n[patient]  Yeah, I've taken things like this in the past and if it is a pill, I know I won't take it. With the shot, it's not like you can undoke it.\n[doctor]  Yeah, that's true, and the shot has been shown to work. It is more just a matter of getting you in to get your shot a month later with the nurse.\n[patient]  Yeah sure sure.\n[doctor]  Okay, so it's called Naltrexone. I think the other name might be Vivitrol. Like I said, the research on it is pretty good.\n[patient]  I think I may have taken an outtrex on before.\n[doctor]  Okay, yeah, maybe you have.\n[patient]  Yeah, if it was available in a pill form, then I'm almost certain I tried it before.\n[doctor]  Okay, if this sounds good though, we can go ahead and get you started with a shot. I am looking and it looks like we have you coming back in on May 17 for your first shot. Does that sound good?\n[patient]  Yeah, yeah, that sounds great. Are there any possible side effects?\n[doctor]  Yeah, some people will experience some nausea, headache, dizziness, anxiety, anxiety, tiredness, and trouble-sleeping, but generally the side effects are mild and should go away within a few days.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Then we can schedule you for follow up in June to see how you're doing.\n[patient]  Alright, that sounds good.\n[doctor]  All right, great. Well, otherwise, stay with your current medicines, keep checking your blood pressure, and let's see if we can stop the alcohol for good. Let us know if you have any questions, or any issues come up after you received the first dose.\n[patient]  Alright, sound good. Thank you.\n[doctor]  You're welcome. Have a good rest of your day.\n[patient]  You too.\n[doctor]  Miss Taylor is drinking alcohol for two five days per week to excess. No tobacco, no substance abuse. Skin is moist. Good trigger.

Edwards is a pleasant 32-year-old female who is last seen in August 2019 with flares of abdominal pain who is diagnosed with irritable bowel that was treated with bentel.\n[patient]  She had a previous prescription for reglan that she received from the emergency room that she used as needed for nausea. She was instructed to start a low-dose fiber supplement such as citric cell daily.\n[doctor]  probiotics to help with gas and bloating, bent a lap to four times daily for intestinal cramping and stop reglan, and used Zofran as needed. Neural modulators such as Eleville and Bussper were discussed, but not started. Hello, how are you?\n[patient]  I'm okay.\n[doctor]  Good how have you been feeling?\n[patient]  Not so good.\n[doctor]  Yeah, so my nurse told me you've been going out to eat some on Friday nights and Saturday nights and that you have had some spicy foods or spicy shrimp.\n[patient]  Yeah, I have.\n[doctor]  Okay, well, your gut probably does not always appreciate that.\n[patient]  No, it doesn't like it at all.\n[doctor]  Yeah, so IBS is one of those things where you're very sensitive to certain things such as spicy foods or fatty foods and alcohol. And this can cause lower belly stuff like cramps or you can get up for belly stuff such as nausea.\n[patient]  I've been getting both.\n[doctor]  Okay, so how frequently have you been getting or having a bowel movement on normal days?\n[patient]  I'm starting to notice it's between two and three times a day.\n[doctor]  Okay, and are they soft stools or form stools?\n[patient]  They are formed.\n[doctor]  Okay, and after you've gone out, either drinking with your friends, do you tend to have more diarrhea?\n[patient]  Yeah, I do.\n[doctor]  Okay. Do you feel it's a food or the alcohol or both?\n[patient]  Well usually we go to Fridays, restaurant, I always eat pasta, the chicken alfredo.\n[doctor]  Okay, I can, I can say Alfredo sauce.\n[patient]  But it normally doesn't bother me.\n[doctor]  Okay, well pasta can make you bloated, but it doesn't usually cause diarrhea. Grilled chicken, grilled chicken, is usually alright. Alfredo though it's higher in fat, and it does contain dairy, but you're saying it usually doesn't bother you?\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  Okay. What type of alcohol drink do you drink when you're there? Is it a sweet drink?\n[patient]  Most of the time it's either tequila or dark liquor. I prefer petroleum, but if I get brown liquor, I only get two. Every now and again, I'll drink a martini.\n[doctor]  Sometimes it's a mixture they tend to put in the drinks, but it can be a variety of things. So when you're not eating out or drinking what we do on a daily basis, does help keep us regular? So when it does flare up, it might not be as bad. Have you had any luck using the fiber like citric cell regularly?\n[patient]  No, I guess I need to find a new drink.\n[doctor]  Okay, and how is it during the week?\n[patient]  Like what I eat.\n[doctor]  Yeah, and with the diarrhea and abdominal pain, abdominal pain.\n[patient]  Right now I'm still having the cramping and sharp pains, so I've been avoiding heavy foods. I did have some fried chicken today though.\n[doctor]  and was everything alright after that?\n[patient]  Yeah, for the most part.\n[doctor]  Okay. Remember it's also the portion sizes, so I mean if you eat a little and you feel fine, then that's okay. You have to just really watch the portions.\n[patient]  Okay good, I can't go out, go without some fried chicken at least once in a while.\n[doctor]  Sounds good. Alright, well, let's take a look at you today and we'll do a brief physical exam. You will hear me call out some findings. I will answer any questions and we will discuss once we have finished the exam.\n[patient]  Sound good.\n[doctor]  Alright, so the patient is alert and cooperative, appears stated age. Alright, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and lungs are clear to consultation bilaterally. Heart regular rate and rhythm. Alright, so if you could just lay back for me and I'll examine your abdomen.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Alright, do you have any tenderness?\n[patient]  No, not really.\n[doctor]  Okay, so the abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses or organomegaly, and let me take a listen. Normal active vowel sounds. All right, you can go ahead and sit up now. Thank you. So first I want you to try Citrus L. It does come in a tablet. You should use it twice daily for regularity. Then I would say if you know you're going out and possibly have diarrhea as a result, you can go ahead and use your bentel 20 milligrams. You can do one tablet before you eat and then repeat up to four times daily.\n[patient]  And then on days when you feel good, you don't have to use anything. And then on Friday before you leave the house, you can take a bentel and put one in your pocket for later. And then you can repeat the same thing on Saturday if you want. And that will be totally fine. Okay, that sounds good.\n[doctor]  Okay, and so you're bentil that's the anti-spasm medication and I would take the higher dose.\n[patient]  Can I refill of that?\n[doctor]  Yes, absolutely. So take one tablet about 30 to 45 minutes before leaving the house and then the second tablet at the restaurant. Then with the nausea, I think we should try and see if you can recognize a pattern with what you're eating and drinking about like, what makes it worse.\n[patient]  Yeah, I noticed I've been doing better with drinking water instead of sodas.\n[doctor]  Okay, good, and then for your zoe friend, I wouldn't take that ahead of time. Just plan on drinking plenty of water.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Okay, and you can take it, but before you do, we want to try to reduce the triggers, so watch out for greasy or fatty foods and sugary drinks.\n[patient]  Okay, I can do that. Okay. And so, however, if it is not just these isolated incidents and the symptoms are happening all the time, we could put you on a long-term medication that would take, that you would take every night.\n[doctor]  And so then you don't have to use so much bento or the Zofran. How do you feel about that?\n[patient]  I was actually going to ask you about something like that to help avoid flares altogether.\n[doctor]  Yeah, there is, and it actually works on the chemicals in your brain that are causing your gut to be overly sensitive. One is called Eleville, but the only drawback is that it can make you a little sleepy. How does that sound?\n[patient]  That sounds like a much better plan.\n[doctor]  Okay great. We can definitely do that just take it every night before bedtime.\n[patient]  Okay, that sounds good. Thank you so much.\n[doctor]  You're welcome, and so I have gone ahead and sent your prescriptions to your pharmacy. Just give us a call if you have any questions or need us for anything else. And then let's plan on touching base through my card email in about a month to just check and to see how you're doing with symptoms. Okay.\n[patient]  Okay, that sounds good. Thank you.\n[doctor]  You're welcome and have a good rest of your day. So a review of symptoms is positive for diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal pain. Assessment and plan, Brittany Edwards is a pleasant female with IBS and functional abdominal pain, aggravated by high stress, poor eating habits, and poor sleeping habits. I've encouraged dietary and lifestyle modifications as well as starting in neuromodulator, such as Eleville 25 milligrams at bedtime for IBS. She can use bentyl 20 milligrams as needed 30 to 45 minutes prior to eating out at a restaurant. She can also use zophrine if needed. However, I have encouraged her to reduce greasy and fatty foods and alcohol consumption. I have asked her to follow up in one month by emailing over my cart regarding any side effects of issues or issues with Eleville or if adjustments are needed.",

            "src": "[patient]  Next patient is Emily Hernandez, date of birth March 26, 2001. This is a 20-year-old female being seen today for her yearly follow-up for asthma, allergic rhinitis, and food allergy. Due to insurance changes since our last office appointment in April 2020, she was switched from SIMBA court to Wixela. She also uses ZurTech in the spring, summer, and fall for seasonal allergy symptoms, which tend to work well. She also has known peanut allergy. She does tolerate almonds and cashews. Please put in the asthma section at the very bottom that the ACT score is 21. Please put under interval history. Written consent is obtained today to use DACS for documentation. Hi Emily, how are you?\n[doctor]  I'm pretty good. How are you?\n[patient]  I'm good. Thank you. So gosh, we last talked a little bit over a year ago, and it was just a telemedicine visit, but it seems like you've been doing pretty good. I know there was an insurance change. I think you had switched over to Wixela, is that right?\n[doctor]  Yep, that's right, and it's what I'm currently using.\n[patient]  Okay, and that's the 250-50 dose, correct?\n[doctor]  Yes, correct.\n[patient]  Perfect. So how does that compare?\n[doctor]  I mean it's working well. I really haven't had any issues with it, and I take it once in the morning and once at night.\n[patient]  And that's one puff twice a day.\n[doctor]  Hm.\n[patient]  Okay, and have you been having to use your Elbuterol inhaler at all?\n[doctor]  Rarely and if I do, it's really just before a workout or something like that if I know I'm really going to be pushing it.\n[patient]  So it sounds like it's around strenuous activity.\n[doctor]  Yes.\n[patient]  Okay, so you can do things like on a walk or go into the grocery store, no problem, and just use it for more exertional stuff.\n[doctor]  Yes, like if I'm gonna go for a run or something like that I'll really just take it before as a preventive.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  And I've been trying to use my daily if I can a little less because I'm trying to go into the military soon.\n[patient]  No kidding, that's great.\n[doctor]  Yeah, so I have to be able to operate basically at a certain fitness level without an inhaler.\n[patient]  Really?\n[doctor]  Yeah, and if I can prove that I'm capable of these activities without an inhaler, it makes it easier.\n[patient]  And so my inhaler. Do they mean both your daily and rescue inhalers?\n[doctor]  MMM so it's like they'll have a fitness test and basically they'll tell me not to take my inhaler that day before the test and then they'll see how the asthma affects me and they're looking to see if it's serious enough to hold me back from joining or whatever. So I've been taking it less and less and really some days I feel like I don't need it.\n[patient]  And that is the wick slot that you're not taking. So on average per week, how many days of the week do you use one puff in the morning and one puff at night?\n[doctor]  Probably about 3 or 4.\n[patient]  Okay, three to four days per week and the other days it's once a day.\n[doctor]  Yes, that's correct.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  and it's either in the morning or at night that I'm taking it.\n[patient]  Okay, do you think that's working okay?\n[doctor]  I do.\n[patient]  great and any urgent care or ER visits it all for breathing over the past year.\n[doctor]  Nope.\n[patient]  Okay, so I'm going to assume no one has put you on prednisone for breathing issues then.\n[doctor]  Nope.\n[patient]  Okay, and now military wise, what's the time frame of when you be completing some of these exertional tests? Like where you next steps?\n[doctor]  So hopefully I'm going to be enlisted early spring 2022. So that gives me about six to seven months to get to a point where I'm able to exert my body where I don't really need the inhaler or at least show them that I have it under control.\n[patient]  Now, when you're in the other room, you completed a breathing test, correct? Correct. Okay, great. So now let me ask you about the allergies, because I know typically you'll use the Zurtec in the spring, summer, and fall, correct?\n[doctor]  Yeah, I don't really, or I'm sorry, I use it more during the spring and fall. I don't really have to use it too much in the summer.\n[patient]  Do you use it more just as neat in the summer?\n[doctor]  Yeah, that's right.\n[patient]  Okay, and have you been taking the Zurtec every day recently since you're right in the mix of spring? Not every day, but I do take it on days. I know I'm going to be outside a lot. I do tend to work outside about three days a week, so definitely take it on those days. And does it seem to work pretty well still? Are you happy with it?\n[doctor]  Yeah, it does. It works great.\n[patient]  Wonderful, good to hear, and then I'm assuming you're staying away from the peanuts. Last year you had told me it worked with you work with Enterprise Reno card and one of the cars had a lot of peanuts in it that you were cleaning out and that gave you hives when you had touched it. Is that correct?\n[doctor]  Yep, that's correct.\n[patient]  Okay, and has there been anything like that sense that experience? No, I don't think so. I definitely became more cautious after that. So I usually wear our long sleeves and change my gloves every time now. So I haven't had a reaction, but I imagine that I probably came in a contact with cars that have peanuts in them.\n[doctor]  But they just didn't touch my skin.\n[patient]  Super, and it sounds like you're really smart about it.\n[doctor]  Yeah, in the airplanes, they have peanuts they give everyone too, so...\n[patient]  Okay, and you have an epipand that you that you keep with you, correct?\n[doctor]  Yes.\n[patient]  Okay, and I'm assuming you're going to need refills I can call you in a new set for the year. Typically, of course, they expire within a year.\n[doctor]  Yeah, okay.\n[patient]  And I remember some time previously you had had some testing for tree nuts, but you do have almonds and cashews correct, and you do okay with them, or do you avoid all tree nuts.\n[doctor]  I do tend to avoid all of them, but I recall eating some almonds at one point really soon after we discussed. I might not be allergic to tree nuts anymore.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  And I remember having them and nothing happened, but I usually just tend to stay away from them really if I can help it.\n[patient]  Okay, so sometimes when people have a peanut allergy, the nuts in general just aren't very important to them.\n[doctor]  So it is very common to avoid both. So let's do this. I'll have Helen come in and I would love to complete a breathing test on you. If your breathing numbers are looking great, we can work on getting you something lower than Wixela.\n[patient]  If you look at all our asthma regimens, it is a step-wise process, and Wixula is a combination of two medications in one, and well, maybe you don't need both of them. Maybe you just need one of them, so we can work our way backwards.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  And so the breathing test will help give us some more guidance. So we will look at the results in just a moment.\n[doctor]  Alright and so this past year I did get into the bad habit of vaping and smoking.\n[patient]  But I've been trying to cut that out. So I should be good and now I only do just a little bit and I'm trying to quit. So I'm sure that might have an effect. It can. So what we can do today is compare your results with prior results probably before you started smoking or using the vape.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  Yeah, and we will see where you stand at that point.\n[doctor]  Alright, that sounds good. Well, let me go ahead and listen, so hop on up here for me.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Alright, so your ears look good, a little bit of wax on both sides. Can I see inside your mouth a big awe? Aw.\n[patient]  Good. Okay. Let me take a peek in your nose. All right, good. You can put your mask back on. Okay. And go ahead, take a big breath in and out. Good. Your lungs sound terrific. I'll listen to your heart. Breathe quietly. Okay. Very good.\n[doctor]  Awesome. So your breathing test is about the same as it was a couple of years ago. It actually looks a little bit better. You may not remember, but when we last completed the test in 2019, do you recall if you were feeling lousy at the time? I think it was a smoke. There were so many fires at that point, and I remember coming in and looking up the window and all you saw was the orange and the smoke.\n[patient]  Yes, you're absolutely right. That was a bad year. That was my first fall here and I was really alarmed. Well, that explains why at that time your numbers were a little bit lower and today they look better. Here's what I think. So you'll have Kaiser currently, correct?\n[doctor]  Correct.\n[patient]  Okay, most insurances do limit what we can use.\n[doctor]  Yeah, I do know that. Okay. So, option one would be to continue using Wixilla like you're using it now. We would classify it as off-label, and you can use it once a day instead of twice a day, which is fine. Some people do that because they just need it once a day. So, that's an option.\n[patient]  Option 2 would be to actually back up to an inhaler that just has one mid.\n[doctor] ites\n[patient]  So the one that Kaiser covers is Alvesco. The thing about Alvesco though, is that it would be two puffs in the morning and two puffs at night. So it's a bit more work. It's not breath activated, but we could step down the lowest dose to see how you do. Some of the newer guidelines for asthma that were published this year is recommending trying to treat people with inhalers like Wixula or Alvesco only when you're ill or say during smoke season, so minimizing their use to those periods of time versus all year. Unless you found out that you're getting yellow or sick, having issues every month, then that would indicate we pull back too much that would have too much. Yeah, okay. So we could step back and possibly get you to the point where you just use those inhalers when you're ill or it's smoke season, but if the first step to do any of that would be to try to drop down to just Alvesco.\n[doctor]  Okay, that actually sounds really good.\n[patient]  Okay great, so I will call that in for you. It will be the lower dose 80 micrograms, and you'll have to do two puffs twice a day.\n[doctor]  Alright.\n[patient]  Okay, and that will be on the box when I call it in. You can put the wicks a lot off to the side, but don't throw it away just in case the LVESCO doesn't work well for you.\n[doctor]  Okay. Got it.\n[patient]  And then ideally we would repeat your breathing test in four months to see how you're doing and then be able to document that you're doing well. Sometimes not always, the military will require documentation on breathing tests.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  Is your pharmacy still the same or did you update it with Helen?\n[doctor]  Yeah, I believe she updated it. It should be Kaiser Pro Monti, Broadway.\n[patient]  Okay, perfect. I'll make sure it's the Alvesco and then I'll renew your Albuterol and Epipen as well.\n[doctor]  Awesome. Thank you.\n[patient]  You're welcome. Then, ZerTech, do you pick it up over the counter or you do get? Do you get as a prescription?\n[doctor]  I just get it over the counter.\n[patient]  Okay, got it. And do you have a nebulizer that you would need refills on? I don't think I need any refills. I haven't used that in such a long time. I think the last time was when I had bronchitis or there was a few select times when I had to use it when I was a kid. Okay, good. Well, I think we have our game plan.\n[doctor]  Okay, awesome.\n[patient]  and do the Alvesco two puffs twice a day in your Albuterol if you need it. The Zurtec 10 milligrams as you need it and continue to stay away from peanuts and tree nuts and I'll refill your EpiPan.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  Alright, so we've got it.\n[doctor]  Great!\n[patient]  All right, I'll have you take this to the front and I'm going to say four months, recheck for asthma and we'll repeat the spirometer, spirometry at that time.\n[doctor]  Okay, sounds good.\n[patient]  Alright, well, thanks so much and you have a great day.\n[doctor]  You too. And we'll do a follow up in four months with a CT and spirometry sooner if needed. Follow up 25 minutes.",

Due to insurance changes during the interim of our last office appointment from 04/2020, she was switched from Symbicort to Wixela. She uses Zyrtec in the spring, summer, and fall for her seasonal allergy symptoms, which tends to work well. She has known peanut and tree nut allergies, which she tries to avoid. She does tolerate almonds and cashew.\n\nMrs. Hernandez is trying to join the military, who require a certain fitness level without use of a rescue or maintenance inhaler, so she has been weaning off her inhalers. She uses albuterol prior to a run, but otherwise functions without it. She has been reducing her Wixela dose, using 1 inhalation once daily 3 times per week, with remaining days using it twice per day as prescribed. She feels this is working well. She denies urgent care or emergency room visits for respiratory issues in the past year. She denies requiring prednisone for breathing issues in the past year.\n\nShe hopes to be enlisted in the military in early spring of 2022. She is currently undergoing exertional testing to this purpose. She explains that this gives hers 6 to 7 months to show that she can exert herself without needing any inhalers.\n\nOver the past year, she admits to vaping and smoking, though she is trying to quit and has cut down her use significantly.\n\nShe notes having a nebulizer but denies needing it recently and has only used it in her past for upper respiratory infections and as a child a few times.\n\nMrs. Hernandez uses Zyrtec during the spring and fall but does not typically have to use it consistently during the summer. She confirms she has been taking Zyrtec 3 days per week when she works outside, and it works well to control her symptoms.\n\nShe has been successfully avoiding peanuts. Incident from last year was reviewed where she was exposed to peanuts when she was cleaning an Enterprise rental car that had a lot of peanuts in it. She developed contact hives when the peanuts encountered her skin. Over the past year she denies additional accidental exposures. She wears long sleeves and changes her gloves between each cleaning. She thinks it is likely that she has been in contact with cars that contained peanuts, but due to her protective measures she did not touch them directly. She confirmed she always keeps an EpiPen with her.\n\nThe patient is also avoiding tree nuts. She did ingest almonds without issue following our discussion that she could try them. Despite tolerating them well, she continues to avoid all tree nuts.\n\nPAST HISTORY\n\nMedical\nAsthma.\nAllergy rhinitis.\nFood allergies to peanut and tree nuts.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nCurrently smokes tobacco and vapes, trying to reduce and interested in cessation in preparation for joining the army.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS\n\nWixela Inhub 250 mcg-50 mcg/dose powder for inhalation. 1 puff 2 times daily in the morning and evening.\nProair HFA as needed.\nEpiPen as needed.\nAlvesco 80 mcg 2 puff 2 times daily.\n\nALLERGIES\n\nPeanuts cause a severe, anaphylactic reaction.\nMontelukast sodium, \u201cseizure-like\u201d reaction.\n\nRESULTS\n\nAsthma Control Test (ACT) Results: ACT score is 21.\nCurrent food skin test sensitivities include peanuts.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\n\u2022 Moderate persistent asthma, uncomplicated.\n\u2022 Allergic rhinitis.\n\u2022 Anaphylactic reaction due to peanuts.\n\nEmily Hernandez is a 20-year-old female who presented today for her yearly follow-up appointment for asthma, allergic rhinitis, and food allergy.\n\nPLAN\n\nModerate persistent asthma, uncomplicated\nThe patient has been using Wixela inhaler daily and admits to reducing her daily dose to one puff per day, 3-4 days per week as she feels she does not always need it the full dose. Additionally, she aspires to join the military and she must meet certain physical fitness requirements without the use of her inhaler. I counseled the patient on current asthma treatment guidelines which recommend using Wixela and Alvesco only when needed during periods of illness. The patient agreed to reducing her medicine to Alvesco which is a single medication, versus 2 in Welixa. The patient will continue to use her albuterol inhaler as needed. Her ACT score is 21 today and her spirometry test today was better than it was in 2019, though she recalls that it was smoky from wildfires during her last breathing test.\n\nAllergic rhinitis\nShe will continue to use Zyrtec as needed, primarily during spring and fall and sometimes in summer. Her current dose cadence is 3 times per week when she works outside. Symptoms are currently under control.\n\nAnaphylactic reaction due to peanuts\nThe patient has successfully avoided peanuts. Plan is to continue with current methods to avoid exposure. I will refill her EpiPen which expires annually.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nModerate persistent asthma, uncomplicated\nStart Alvesco, 2 puffs twice daily. Keep Wixela in case Alvesco does not work well. Continue albuterol as needed. Return in 4 months to repeat ACT and spirometry testing.\n\nAllergic rhinitis\nContinue Zyrtec 10 mg daily as needed.\n\nAnaphylactic reaction due to peanuts\nContinue strict avoidance of peanuts. I will refill her EpiPen today.",

            "src": "[doctor]  Okay, so our next patient is Christopher Watson, date of birth April 12th, 1934. Mr. Watson is a 86-year-old male who returns in follow-up for adult hydrocephalus. This is his first visit since undergoing Shuncheon surgery, excuse me, in August 1st, 2020. I have followed Mr. Watson since May 2020 when he first presented with eight to ten years of progressive gate impairment, cognitive impairment, and decreased bladder control. We established a diagnosis of adult hydrocephalus with a spinal catheter protocol in June 2020, and he underwent Shuncheon surgery on August 1st, 2020. Metronics straight up programmical shunt in the ventricular peritoneal configuration was programmed at a level of 2.0 was placed. Good morning, Mr. Watson. Who is the nice lady you have with you today?\n[patient]  High document, this is my daughter Teresa. She's the one who helps me keep things straight.\n[doctor]  Mr. Watson, have you been sick or been hospitalized since your shunt shunt surgery three months ago?\n[patient]  Not that I recall. No, he hasn't. He's been doing much better.\n[doctor]  Good. I'm glad to hear that. Before surgery, you were having some progressive problems that affected your walking, thinking, and bladder control. Are these symptoms better, worse, or unchanged? His walking has improved. He is now able to walk to the dining room just fine, but he could not do that before surgery. He's still as times where I have to help him.\n[patient]  That's impressive, Mr. Watson.\n[doctor]  Yeah, I guess. Now his bladder control did improve some after surgery, but now seems to have leveled out, so he is wearing diapers.\n[patient]  No issues with sores from wearing the diaper and any decreased or painful urination.\n[doctor]  No, not at all. And how about cognition?\n[patient]  I think I'm better. I don't feel lost when talking to someone anymore.\n[doctor]  Dan and I both think my sister Hannah summarized it best. She said I feel like I can have a normal conversation with him again. Not so wonderful. Now have you had any headaches or pain where the shundas?\n[patient]  No, hasn't bothered me one bit.\n[doctor]  Okay, and any pain in your belly at all?\n[patient]  can't say that I have.\n[doctor]  Okay, sounds like you have been improving. Alrighty, Mr. Watson, I'm gonna step out of the room while my resident comes in to do a few tests for me. Is that all right?\n[patient]  Sound good.\n[doctor]  Okay, I'm gonna go out and review the CT scan you had last month, and then we will chat about it when I come in. Alrighty, Mr. Watson. So you definitely have made some improvements since the shunt surgery. Now on CT Skin Though, I do believe I see a tiny bit of blood fluid collection in the right parietal region.\n[patient]  now i don't believe that that's causing any symptoms and i it actually wasn't documented by the radiologist when he read the ct scan\n[doctor]  What does that mean? Just that I would like to leave the shunt set for another two to three months before we go and changing it. Like I said, if you're not having any headaches or pain and you have improved, so that's all good for me. So really there is, there is nothing to worry about. Alright, so I'll come back in three months.\n[patient]  Yep, that's right.\n[doctor]  I do have a question for you though.\n[patient]  Yeah, of course.\n[doctor]  Do you think I will be able to drive again? Man, Mr. Watson, I knew you were going to ask me that one. I think at this point, it's unlikely that your movement speed will improve to the level that would be needed for you to pass the driver's safety evaluation. Now, I will say that I do occasionally have patients who surprise me by improving over a nine to 12 month range and that definitely could be you. You could definitely pass it at that point. So if you improve and we can continue to talk about that, then you know I think it could be possible and I would be happy to recommend it. Now you could definitely also enroll in a driver's safety program without my recommendation. So you could kind of do that preemptively and then we could continue to watch for your improvement as we go.\n[patient]  Okay, I kinda figured that anyway, but I just thought I'd ask I don't like to burn anyone when I just need to run to the store, but I also know that I need to be safe.\n[doctor]  Yeah, your safety is our number one priority, and you know I'm sure your daughters don't mind as much, right? They want to keep you here and have you safe, but I overall am very pleased with how much you have improved.\n[patient]  And so, I'm sure when we talked again in three months, we'll continue to be on that upper trajectory of improvement.\n[doctor]  I sure hope so, Don.\n[patient]  We really appreciate all that you've done. Do we make the appointment up front?\n[doctor]  Yeah, that would be great. The girls up front will take care of you and get you settled for three months from now and you both take care, right?\n[patient]  Thanks.\n[doctor]  Thank you. Alrighty, so roast is constitutional significant for impertability to carry out daily functions negative for fever or unintentional weight loss. Goo is significant for urinary incontinence and wearing a diaper. Negative for genital sores, decreased or painful output.

Mr. Watson is a pleasant and cooperative man who is able to converse easily through though his daughter does add some details. The shunt site was clean, dry, and intact with a confirmed setting of two.\n[patient]  He was tested for recent remote memory, attention span and concentration and fund of knowledge. He scored a 26 out of 30 on the MMSE when tested with spelling and 25 out of 30 when tested with calculations.\n[doctor]  Of note, he was able to get two of the three memory words with Qing and the third with multiple choice. This was a slight improvement over his initial score of 23 out of 30 with calculations and 24 out of 30 with spelling. And at the time he was unable in the previous testing, excuse me, he was unable to remember any memory words and Qing without and only one with multiple choice. Gate tested using the Tnetti assessment tool. He was tested without an assistive device and received a gate score of 6 to 8 out of 12 and a balanced score of 12 out of 16 for a total score of 18 to 20 out of 28. This is slightly improved from his initial score of 15 to 17 out of 28. Cranial nerves, pupils are equal, eums are intact, face symmetric, no dysarthria, motor normal for bulk and strength, coordination slow from no finger to nose. Of note, the CT CT scanned from the head of October 15, 2020 shows a frontal horn stand at the level of firm and of menroma of 4.6 cm with a third ventricular contour that is flat with a span of 10 mm. By my reading, there is a tiny amount of blood in the right frontal region with a tiny sub-dermal collection. This was not noticed or noted by the radiologist who stated in any extra axial fluid collections. There is also substantial small vessel ischemic change.

I do not believe that this tiny amount of fluid is symptomatic, and it was not documented by the radiologist when he read the CT scan.\n\nMr. Watson asked me about whether he will be able to drive again. Unfortunately, I think it is unlikely that his speed of movement will improve to a level that he will be able to pass a driver's safety evaluation, however, occasionally patients surprise me by improving enough over 9 to 12 months that they are able to pass such a test. I would certainly be happy to recommend such a test if I believe he is likely to pass it and he is always welcome to enroll in a driver's safety program without my recommendation, however, I think it is exceeding unlikely that he has the capability of passing this rigorous test at this time. I also think it is quite likely he will not regain sufficient speed of motion to pass such a test.\n\nPLAN\n\nI had a long discussion with the patient and his daughter. We are all pleased that he has started to make some improvement with his hydrocephalus because of the fluid collection in the right parietal region, I would like to leave the setting at 2.0 for another three months before we consider changing the shunt.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nFollow up in 3 months.",

Last time he was here, he received a steroid injection in his right knee. Hello Mr. Nelson, how are you?\n[patient]  About the same as last time, my knee is still swollen.\n[doctor]  That was your right knee, correct? I take it the injection, did it help?\n[patient]  It may be for a couple of weeks.\n[doctor]  That's it, and is it still painful?\n[patient]  Yeah, it's pretty painful and now the whole leg is getting swollen.\n[doctor]  Okay. What would you say your pain level is?\n[patient]  I mean right now it's about a three or so, but typically on the normal day it's around six.\n[doctor]  Okay, and it's been swollen like that for how long now.\n[patient]  Since I was last year a couple of weeks after that. So about maybe two months now?\n[doctor]  Okay, but before it was just the knee?\n[patient]  Yeah, the whole thing wasn't swollen like this, but I tried to wear compression socks a lot of the time, but it hasn't been helping.\n[doctor]  Okay, okay, so that hasn't been working for you.\n[patient]  I mean it helped to some degree, but it's still swollen, especially around the knee.\n[doctor]  Hmm, has it been keeping you from doing things during the day?\n[patient]  While I slow down a little bit and I try to do things too fast, but when it really hurts is when I've been sitting for a while and I try to get up. I'm so stiff getting up, I have to use a cane to get my bearings, I mean after a little bit it loosens up, but if first getting up is really difficult.\n[doctor]  Yeah, I can see. That makes sense. Have you been taking your medication regularly? You're on Zellgen's, right?\n[patient]  Yeah, the XR I think it's 11 milligrams a day. Yeah, but I'm taking it every day and I'm also taking celibrex, which I started maybe two months ago.\n[doctor]  Yeah, the 200 mixed daily. How is that working for you?\n[patient]  Pretty good up until this started swelling again.\n[doctor]  Okay, we'll come sit over here and if you could take off your socks and shoes and we'll take a look at your knee. And just to let you know, I have a service now that writes my note about the visit so you'll hear, hear me call things out and describe what I see fully. Okay, gotcha.\n[patient]  Right, so let's check your leg. Can you straighten it and does it hurt? Yeah, when I try to straighten it all the way it does.\n[doctor]  Okay, range of motions slightly diminished. I'm going to press here, okay? And how about here? Hmm, I see some pitting around the knee and ankle. Normal capillary refill in the toes. Does any of this area hurt?\n[patient]  Just like an old Bruce.\n[doctor]  So I can feel that the knee is hot and that means there is something going on like some inflammation so we can give you another steroid injection for that. I also want to get an x-ray of that knee so we can see where all the swelling is coming from. Yes sounds good to me.\n[patient]  Okay, and do we set up physical therapy for you last time you were here?\n[doctor]  No, I was doing some years ago, but that was the other knee. Okay, so I think we will set that up for you now. We will also do an x-ray on that knee I can send you for a physical therapy, and if nothing is helping then we really might need to get a surgery consult to see what we can do with that knee.\n[patient]  Okay, something a plan.\n[doctor]  Alright, so for today we'll go ahead and we'll give you the steroid shot. I'll try to see if I can get a little bit of fluid out before I do give you the injection. There might be no fluid, but I'll see if I can get anything out regardless.\n[patient]  Okay, and that's the procedure you're going to do right now.\n[doctor]  Yep, once we're done talking here, and as far as the edema in your legs, we'll take an x-ray to look for the cause, but there is a lot you can. Do as well. The compression socks are a good start, and also do you eat a lot of salt?\n[patient]  I mean, I, I mean, I love my salty snacks.\n[doctor]  Okay, well salt does have a tendency to make your body hold onto water. Reducing your salt intake could help with some of the swelling. You can also prop your feet up anytime you get a chance especially at night.\n[patient]  and have you talked to your primary care doctor about this at all? No, I think I'll just come here first. Okay, so I think try some of those things out first, and if it doesn't help, definitely make an appointment with them.\n[doctor]  Also, as you know, Zellgenz is a high-risk medication, so we need to check your CMP levels every couple of months. So, this time your levels are good, but you make sure to make an appointment for the blood work for next time.\n[patient]  Alright, I can do that. Thank you so much, Doc.\n[doctor]  Yes, of course, well, let me go ahead and get supplies, and we'll get to work on your knee. Fluid aspiration and steroid injection procedure.
