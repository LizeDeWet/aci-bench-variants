            "src": "[doctor]  Hey, good morning, Bobby. How are you?\n[patient]  I'm doing okay. I as you're aware, Dr. Miller sent me over for this pain in my belly that I've had for several weeks. They did. He did an ultrasound and then said I had gallstones and they recommended I stay several away from some high fat food, but I'm just still having a lot of pain and he refer me to you.\n[doctor]  Alright, well, I'm sorry to hear that you're having pain, but I am glad that he sent you over to see me. I want to talk a little bit more about that pain, can you describe the kind of pain that you feel?\n[patient]  Well, it's on the right hand side of my belly. It's right underneath my ribs. And it feels like a squeezing severe pain it comes and goes, but when it comes, it's really severe. And I get kind of nauseated and sick in my stomach.\n[doctor]  Okay, and then when you get that pain, can you rate that pain for me on a scale like zero being none 10 being the worst pain you've ever been in your life?\n[patient]  When it's severe, it's probably innate.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right, and then time-wise are we looking at can it just come and go any time? Or is it specifically around meal times? How does that pain kind of wax and wane for you?\n[patient]  Most of the time, it comes right after I eat.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  but it also can come on a couple of hours after I eat also. So it's either immediately after I eat or a couple hours later, but it's related to eating.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  You know, I like to eat right.\n[doctor]  Doe-way also, speaking of eating, let's talk a little bit about your diet. I see here on your chart that you're a type 2 diabetic. And it looked like that you were going to handle that with diet and exercise. Let's talk about that a little bit.\n[patient]  Well, you know what my diet was worse when I before I was diagnosed with the Type 2 diabetes.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  And since then I've cut back on sugar and I started a little bit of a keto diet and I've lost about 25 pounds over the last three months.\n[doctor]  Okay, so other than the weight loss, how how is your diet is that has that been working out for you? I mean, do you does, does that, does that fit your lifestyle pretty well?\n[patient]  Yeah, it does it, I was surprised it wasn't as hard as I thought to go back and cut back and go more of a keto diet.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  But you know trying to cut out all those carbs my symptoms got better.\n[doctor]  Yeah\n[patient]  with the diabetes and my blood sugars are improving, but I still get that pain underneath the ribs.\n[doctor]  Yeah, and that can happen. And one of those things that causes that is that those intake of that fatty foods, which is, you know, kind of the keystone or the hallmark of the keto diet, and have you noticed any improvement when you do cut out that fatty food, and has that been difficult since you are watching your carbon take.\n[patient]  The fatty food, it is a little bit difficult, you know, I like those pork rinds and you know, I've had to kind of cut those out, they were a nice staple for me when I was on a keto diet, but I have cut out to those pork rinds because those are just so delicious and you know, I would say the little bit better, but I still get that pain.\n[doctor]  Okay, and then do you have any family history of gallbladder disease?\n[patient]  Yeah, but you know, you know, I knew those coming both my dad and my mother both had gallbladder disease and had to have their gallbladders off.\n[doctor]  Okay, so both both your parents, your mom and your dad had your had their gallbladders taken out.\n[patient]  Yeah.\n[doctor]  Okay, and then I want to talk a little bit about your activity level and your and if your exercising has this affected your ability to get out and exercise.\n[patient]  Not really. I mean, I usually got to watch around meals, you know, but I've never been a big exercise right after eating anyhow. But you know, I'm so glad springs here because it gives me that opportunity to get back out. And you know, I love photography. I love nature photography and with the width of the woods, going from you know that dark barren look to coming alive with that green and then budding. I love to get out and take foot photographs there.\n[doctor]  That's awesome to hear you, I'm my wife, and I like to go over and take nature hikes through the new park behind the rec center. That just opened up, have you ever been over there to do any any picture taken we've got a bunch of beautiful nature pictures that we took about a week ago?\n[patient]  No, I haven't been there. I might have to try that out yet.\n[doctor]  Jetzt awesome!\n[patient]  I like to get down near the river that's where I like to catch especially around springtime.\n[doctor]  That's great, you next time you come in maybe you can bring in some of your pictures that would be awesome to see.\n[patient]  Okay cool.\n[doctor]  So I'm just curious talking about your symptoms here. Have you had any fevers you mentioned something about nausea? But have you actually vomited from those symptoms?\n[patient]  There's times when the pain is really bad for a couple of days I've had some what I would describe as low grade fevers. And yes, you're right, I have feel nauseated, but I haven't thrown up.\n[doctor]  Okay, so if it's okay with you, I'm going to go ahead and do a quick physical exam. Your vital signs look good today. Blood pressure was 128 over 88 respiratory rate, was 16 your pulse rate was 68. You were 8 feb. Today, which is a good thing and your oxygen saturation on room air was 99% taking a listen to your heart. Here your heart is regular of rate and rhythm no. I don't hear any. Ack topic beats no clicks. Rubbs or murmurs noted listening to your lungs. Here they are clear and equal bilaterally to osculation. Now I'm going to go ahead and do an abdominal exam. I do note positive vowel sounds soft, non-distended abdomen. However, you are positive for some slight guarding there to the right upper quadrant, but I don't note any rebound tenderness. Now I'm going to press slightly here beneath your ribs on the right hand side. Now take a breath and does that hurt when I press.\n[doctor]  So I see that you're guarded there. So I'm going to say that that it did hurt when I did hurt when I.\n[patient]  Absolutely that hurts so much when you push right there.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  Sorry, I was just trying to capture my breath.\n[doctor]  Okay, that's no problem. So you are positive for Murphy's signs, but I don't appreciate any peritoneal signs. So let's talk a little bit about your results that I reviewed before you came in today. So your abdominal ultrasound shows multiple gallstones present in the gallbladder, and I do appreciate some mild thickening. Now the common bile duct size is within normal limits at four. One millimeters now. Let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you. Okay. I do believe you have some mild colisostitis. With gallstones, I don't appreciate any frank obstruction, but it looks like your gallbladder is inflamed. And it looks like that's happened maybe over the last few weeks since you've been having those symptoms now, since you haven't had any improvement with dietary modifications, I am going to make the recommendation that we do remove your gallbladder. And I would like to perform a laparoscopic colisostectomy. Now what that means is I'll make a few small incisions and insert a scope with some of those instruments that's going to remove that gallbladder. Through one of those little bitty incisions now, the surgery is going to take about an hour to an hour and a half. And you'll probably spend the night in the hospital because we just want to monitor your post procedure to make sure everything is okay, you're still going to want to avoid those high fat foods after surgery and eat foods that are going to be high in fiber. Now do you have any questions about what our assessment and plan is for for this?\n[patient]  No no questions today.\n[doctor]  Okay, now the other thing.\n[patient]  How soon can I how soon will I be able to get up and get moving back outside after the surgery?\n[doctor]  So the good news is since it's a laparoscopic procedure, you're going to be back on your feet pretty quick now for the first 24 hours. I'm going to want you to take it pretty easy. But after a couple of days, if you feel like moving around on some solid ground, you know, we don't want you hiking or anything like that. But if you feel like moving around on some solid ground, you can get up and walk around within a day or two and then in about a week. Or so I'll see you again and then we'll release you to go get back out there in nature.\n[patient]  Okay, thank you very much.\n[doctor]  You're very welcome. The other thing I want to talk briefly about is now you're not your type two diabetes. I want you to follow up with your physician just to make sure that you're handling your diabetes, especially the fact that you're going to have surgery and those type of things. And we will just continue to monitor your diabetes as has been outlined by your your additional either your endocrinologist or your primary care provider I'm going to have the nurse come in and get some paperwork signed. And if you don't have any questions for me, I will see you next week. And we will get this gallbladder out.\n[patient]  Well, thank you very much. I'm looking forward to it. I don't want any more of that pain so.\n[doctor]  Alright that sounds good, we'll see you next week then.\n[patient]  Okay, take care.\n[doctor]  Yeah",

I'm just trying to avoid lifting anything, anything, anything, anything a little bit too heavy like I had a chipmint command. So I had a box in the driveway the other day and reaching down and picking up the box was a little tough.\n[doctor]  Okay, and we're exactly on your shoulder does it hurt?\n[patient]  It's cut on the on the backside, right right around here.\n[doctor]  Thumbnaoth, okay, all right. And are you able to lift up your shoulder so that your shoulder touches your ear at all?\n[patient]  Yeah, no, that's that's that's hurting a little bit.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right. And what have you taken for the pain?\n[patient]  Just a little bit of Tylenol, try and take it easy.\n[doctor]  Did that help at all?\n[patient]  It kind of like kept it at the same spot that has been, but it really didn't make it go down.\n[doctor]  Okay, so are your symptoms any better since it happened or are they about the same?\n[patient]  Know what they're about the same.\n[doctor]  Okay, and any neck problems to do, injure your neck when this happened.\n[patient]  No neck has been okay.\n[doctor]  Okay, and any other joint problems like does your elbow hurt on that side or your wrist or is it just your shoulder?\n[patient]  Nope, the rest of it's doing okay. It's just the shoulder.\n[doctor]  Okay, and any other orthopedic injuries in the past have you ever injured that shoulder before, as far as you know?\n[patient]  Nope, nope, that one that one's been fine.\n[doctor]  Okay, and any other surgeries or any other medical problems.\n[patient]  I mean I had appendicitis, so I had an appendectomy.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  Maybe like three, four years ago, but that's about it.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right, well, I'm just gonna go ahead and do a quick physical exam. I'm gonna be calling out my exam findings. I'll let you know what that means. So, and last thing, have you had any fever or chills since this happened at all?\n[patient]  A slight headache, but no no no fever.\n[doctor]  Okay, did you hit your head when you when this happened?\n[patient]  A little bit.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right, did you pass out?\n[patient]  Nope, nope stayed conscious throughout.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right, well looking at your vital signs here in the office, you don't have any fever your blood pressure looks quite good. It's about 122 over 76. Your heart rate is appropriate at 82 beats per minute and your oxygenation is 95% on room air on your cervical spine exam. There is no tenderness to palpation of the cervical spine. There is full range of motion on head exam. There does not appear to be any trauma. There is no echinemosis or bruising right shoulder exam on your musculoskeletal exam. There is pain to palpation of the posterior shoulder at the acromioclavicular joint. There is decreased abduction and adduction to about 90 degrees only there is there is a he is pain with supination and pronation of the right arm and there is a palpable radial radial artery pulse. Okay, so what does that mean that just means that you have some you know evidence of the injury there and we're going to talk about that. So I had the nurse do a shoulder x-ray on you before I came in the room and the results of your right shoulder x-ray show that you have an acute acromioclavicular joint fracture. So you just have a a small fracture of the acromion. I don't think that it's going to be anything that we need to do surgery for so let's just talk a little bit about my assessment and plan. So for your right shoulder injury for your acute acromioclavicular joint fracture, I want to go ahead and just put you in a sling for now. I want to go ahead and prescribe meloxicam 15 milligrams. Once a day, I want to go ahead and just order a cat scan of your right shoulder just to kind of get a better look of how the joint looks and we're going to go ahead and refer you to physical therapy to strengthen your shoulder in hopes of avoiding surgery in the future. How does that sound?\n[patient]  Yeah, that sounds great. Just being able to take a little bit of something for the pain would would be really appreciated.\n[doctor]  Okay do you think you need something stronger than Meloxicam?\n[patient]  No give that shot.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  and see how that goes.\n[doctor]  Okay, any questions?\n[patient]  What can I get back out on the field?\n[doctor]  While you can't play tagle football for a while you have to have this fracture healed.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  And I would avoid doing it, you know, as we get older, you know our bones get a little bit weaker. So I would avoid the tackle football, maybe flag football in the future, okay?\n[patient]  Yeah, yeah, that sounds good.\n[doctor]  Okay, anything else?\n[patient]  Now I think that's been great. Thank you so much.\n[doctor]  Okay you're welcome, have a good day bye.\n[patient]  Thanks.",

Are you having pain when you're just sitting there or when you're moving around for a very short period of time it felt like I was going to tap over? I like I couldn't support my upper body weight and then my right toe or the toes on my right foot tingled a little bit, but that went away after about an hour. Okay, are you still getting that numbing and tingling periodically in your feet or is that completely gone?\n[patient]  That's completely gone and it just happened when I first felt the tweak in my lower back. I felt that sensation, but I haven't since.\n[doctor]  Okay, and how about any difficulty or weakness in your legs?\n[patient]  Only if I'm carrying something heavy otherwise it seems relatively normal, but I feel the sensation so I'm a little nervous about carrying something heavy.\n[doctor]  Okay, and are, and do you still have pain down there in your lower back if I turn a certain way? Or if I roll over in my sleep, I'll wake up from it from a like a sharp pain. But then that goes away if I position myself the right way, okay. And what have you been taking for the pain?\n[patient]  I took some Tylenol, I took some ibuprofen, I've tried heat, I've tried ice and nothing really seems to help.\n[doctor]  Okay, is the ibuprofen any better than the Tylenol?\n[patient]  a little bit, but for sure a shorter period of time.\n[doctor]  Okay and did you get any stomach upset from the ibuprofen?\n[patient]  Now I try not to take too much, so I don't have an upset stomach from it.\n[doctor]  Okay, and did you go to like an urgent care centang or an emergency room have you had any imaging on this at all?\n[patient]  I went in urgent care and they wanted me to do a Mariah, but I was a little concerned because I think we maxed out our insurance. So I didn't do it because it started to feel better, but because it's been going on so long I'm a little bit concerned now. I do want to actually move forward with that.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right, and any other symptoms, any problems with like your bladder or your bowels, any incontinence, or you know you feel like you can't go to the bathroom.\n[patient]  Now I haven't had any of those issues.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right. And any other, any other past medical history? Do you that you have any?\n[patient]  I had knee surgery about two years ago on my right knee.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  That went fine. I rehabbed a point has been fine that it feels about 95% ever since.\n[doctor]  Okay, and what did you have done to your right knee?\n[patient]  It was a total knee replacement.\n[doctor]  Okay, a total near replacement in 2018, is that what you said.\n[patient]  No was actually about two years ago, so it's the spring of 2020.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right, all right, well, I want to go ahead and just move on to a physical exam. I'm going to be calling out some of my exam findings.\n[patient]  MM\n[doctor]  Now you have you had any fever or chills with this.\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right, all right. So looking at your vital signs here in the office, you know, they look really good to you. You don't have any temperature your blood pressure is good. It's about 117 over 56.\n[patient]  MM\n[doctor]  Your heart rate is nice and slow at 68 and your oxygenation is fine at 95% on room air so that means everything looks good.\n[patient]  Good.\n[doctor]  On your neck exam, I do appreciate some bony protuberance of the C5C6 do you have any pain when I touch here?\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  No okay on your lumber spine exam. I do appreciate you have pain when I touch here.\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  Okay, so there is no pain to palpation of the lumbar spine, there is decreased flexion, and extension of the lower back the patient does have a positive straight leg raise, and there is some spasm of the paraspinal muscles of the lumbar spine on musculoskeletal exam, the lower extremities strength is equal bilaterally. So what does that mean Jeremy? That means that you have some, you know, maybe a some arthritis in your neck here, and or maybe. Just a little bit of some injury from from that from that. Back that back thing that you told me about.\n[patient]  MM\n[doctor]  Okay, but I think overall things look really good. So you know I had them do in Lumber Spine X-ray on you before I saw you. And I looked at the results of your Lumber Spine X-ray, which showed no acute bony abnormality. You know, there was no fracture of your back, or anything which is not surprising based on your history. So let's just talk a little bit about my assessment and plan. So I do believe it sounds like you have an acute disc. Herniation now, this did happen a few months ago, but it sounds like that's what you had based on the fact that you're still having symptoms.\n[patient]  MM\n[doctor]  I do want to go ahead and order a Lumber Spine MRI to get a better look at what's going on you know x-rays really just look at the bones they don't show us any of the soft tissue. So let's go ahead and order the Lumber Spine MRI. I want to continue with physical therapy. So I'm going to refer you to a physical therapist through our health system.\n[patient]  MM\n[doctor]  And then I also want to go ahead and prescribe Meloxicam 15 milligrams once a day.\n[patient]  MM\n[doctor]  to help with that, do you have any questions about that?\n[patient]  No questions.\n[doctor]  Now if you do have a herniated disc, we can go ahead and talk about some other treatment options, maybe like an epidural steroid injection to help take down some of that inflammation.\n[patient]  MM\n[doctor]  It might make you feel better, but we'll deal with that when we get there okay.\n[patient]  Sure.\n[doctor]  Any questions?\n[patient]  Not at this point.\n[doctor]  Okay, great thank you.\n[patient]  Thank you.",

            "src": "[doctor]  So Dennis is a 57. Your old male today complaining of shortness of breath, he has also got a history of diabetes, high blood pressure and history of asthma. So Dennis tell me what's going on, how are you doing?\n[patient]  Not too good.\n[doctor]  Okay, how long have you been feeling? Not too well.\n[patient]  about a couple of weeks.\n[doctor]  Couple of weeks tell me what's going on.\n[patient]  I wake up with shortness of breath.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  I go to when I'm sure to breath there, I get back home, and I'm again sure to breath, so I had a tough time dealing with this.\n[doctor]  Have you noticed any, are you coughing up anything and he's swelling in your legs? Or what's going on?\n[patient]  Yeah, but I've been coughing up. I've been coughing up blood.\n[doctor]  Okay, how long has that been going on for?\n[patient]  probably three weeks or so.\n[doctor]  Okay, and are you coughing a lot of blood? Or just a little bit of blood?\n[patient]  I shave three to four cups a day.\n[doctor]  While that's a lot of blood, okay are you throwing up any blood are you having bleeding in any place else or just when you cough?\n[patient]  Only when I cough.\n[doctor]  Okay, have you noticed any bruising or bleeding from your teeth or anything like that or from your gums or anything like that?\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  Okay, any leg swelling or calf swelling or any anything like that any recent travel history you've been on a plane or trip recently?\n[patient]  I had some knee problem, but there is no swelling, but it hurts that's been going on for quite some time.\n[doctor]  Okay, so that's not near the knee problem, okay? And have you had any, have you been to the hospital or been to the emergency room? Or anything like that for your coughing and coughing up blood?\n[patient]  Now I try to get an appointment in the office, but they were kind of booked up.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  They just know.\n[doctor]  Alright, and alright, no, but no fever with this. So since you're here, your oxygen level looks pretty good in the clinic, it's about 94% on pulse, your pulse oxygenation, so that's good or you short a breath. So when you walk or you or you exert yourself, your short a breath, you said, right, okay, and have you. And how how is your blood sugar been doing since this has been going on? I know you're on metform and how's your diabetes been doing.\n[patient]  Not so good, you know, kind of going up and down, I wear this dexcom.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  You know after meal they spike up while over 200.\n[doctor]  Okay, and...\n[patient]  And morning when I get up there around 150.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right. So it's been running a little bit high. I know we checked your hemoglobin a1c last time and it was about seven. Seven. I think and we had talked about, you know, improving your diet and improving some exercise, but is this blood sugar been high and low or high in normal when you're especially in the last three weeks or has it been going on for longer than that?\n[patient]  I would say about a month.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right. And how is your blood pressure been at home since you've been taking since these episodes that you've been sick or you're taking norvask?\n[patient]  Yes, I am, but I keep them on some days because my blood pressure has been running someone on the low side.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right. And right now it's about 120 over 70, what how low does it go in the more when you check it?\n[patient]  while there are sometimes in the lower 90s.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right. Well, let me let me examine you here in a second. And we'll think about you know what we need to do, especially with your coughing and your shortness of breath. Okay. So, Neeta, I'm examining you now. Let's pretend I did my exam. I'm just going to verbalize some of my findings so I can put it into my chart. Okay. And I'll explain what those things mean. So on my exam, you've got no JVD. There is no swelling in your neck. No carotid. Brutes your lung exam. You've got some rails and some ronkyon. On more on the right side, I don't hear any wheezing right now. There is some diminished breath sounds on the right side. As well on your heart exam, you've got two over-successolic ejection murmur. You've had that in the past that's unchanged from before the rest regular rate. And rhythm otherwise your belly exam is nice and soft on your extremity exam. You've got one plus non-pitting edema on both of your lower extremities on your on your ankles. No calf tenderness. No negative home in sign. So what does all this mean? So basically, you've got, you know, you've got some sort of infection or something going on in your lungs that I can hear right now. The rest of your exam is pretty much stable. It's unchanged from before. So let's talk about what we should do about this. So for the first problem with the shortness of breath, the first thing I want to do is go ahead and get a chest x-ray for you. Okay. You've been coughing up blood. I also want to send you to the emergency department to get some blood testing done. I'm worried about a blood clot or something else going on. So I want to get a cat scan of your chest as well. So I'm going to go ahead and refer you to the emergency department. I'll call them and and have you head over that way. They can get a chest x-ray and a cat scan and some blood work as well. And then we'll evaluate why you're having the shortness of breath and why you're coughing up this blood. Okay. And then depending on what they find you, may need you know, it could be as simple as a pneumonia or it could be something a little bit more serious. We may have to get, you know, start, you know, depending on what you find, we will get the right treatment started any questions about that or can you drive to the emergency department from here or is that okay?\n[patient]  Yeah, I can bike no problem. I have no question.\n[doctor]  All right, for the second problem for the diabetes. Since your blood sugar is running a little bit high, once you get over this and blood sugars, running a little bit high once we get you over this hump of the shortness of breath and get this diagnosed, I'm going to go ahead and order another hemoglobin, A1c today. We will probably increase your dose of metformin from 500 twice a day to 750 twice a day. So why don't we do that? And then why don't we have, we'll have the hemoglobin A1c back. And then we can once you get over this illness that your undergoing will, we'll discuss that moral have you come back in about three weeks to just discuss your diabetes. And what our treatment plan will be for that okay.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  For the high blood pressure, definitely hold off on the norbask for right now. Let's figure out what's going, what's causing this episode of shortness of breath. I want some blood testing done. And once we have that under better control, we can reassess your blood pressure. So right now, hold the norbask, and then we'll have you come back once everything is done, okay?\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  Any other questions or anything we know if we need to talk about today?\n[patient]  No, I'm good.\n[doctor]  Sounds good we'll get you signed out here in a second.",

            "src": "[doctor]  Alright Scott, so I understand that you had some right knee injury. Can you tell me a little bit about what happened?\n[patient]  Yeah, we'll try to go out and play some pick up soccer games over the weekend and want to go to the ball and then just fell to pop in my right knee.\n[doctor]  Okay, and how long ago did that happen?\n[patient]  about three days ago.\n[doctor]  Three days, okay. And when did you notice any swelling, anything like that?\n[patient]  It is swollen, some of that swelling has gone down.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  But it mainly just it feels like that I just I can't my knee is just not as functionally it's not moving as well as what it used to be it seems to be a little limited.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right, and then so how's the pain with your knee on a scale of one to 10-1 being the least pain, 10 being the worst pain house house has been ranging?\n[patient]  It's somewhere between 6 and 7 right now. It's about 4 or 5 with some of the swelling going down.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right. And did you take anything at all to relieve the pain?\n[patient]  Anti-inflammatories.\n[doctor]  Okay, already, and did that help.\n[patient]  Yeah, the ibuprofen helped a little bit, but I'm on it pretty on a pretty regular basis right now.\n[doctor]  Gotcha, okay. Now tell me are you able to bend or straighten your leg ever since then?\n[patient]  I can bend it, but it hurts toward the end of the motion and I can straighten it, but it doesn't feel like I have to help get it straightened.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right. And then how about you able to bear any weight on it or walk on it at all?\n[patient]  I can still bear weight on it, but it feels just really loose and it doesn't feel normal.\n[doctor]  Gotcha, okay. Alright, well let's go ahead and take a look at your knee here real quick before I take a look at your knee here. I'm going to do a physical exam. And in terms of your gate here, I did notice that you do have a marked limp on your looks like it's your right leg upon ambulation. So let me go ahead and take a look at that right knee real quick. I do appreciate some significant effusion in the right knee just a slight bit of echinosis. Just feel around here, Scott, how does that feel does? That hurt when I kind of press on that there.\n[patient]  A little bit of pain there, not really bad, it feels like it's just more on the inside of my knee.\n[doctor]  Yep, okay, so you definitely feeling some a little bit of pain to palpation at the medial joint line. Now I'm going to have you lie on your back and also I'm going to do some maneuvering here of your leg. I'm going to do a real quick test on you here, okay? All right, how does that feel?\n[patient]  Just feels just feels loose it hurts when you pull it at the very end.\n[doctor]  Okay, sorry about that. Alright, so you're definitely having some difficulty with some passive range of motion here, and you're lacking a few degrees of terminal extension to about 115 degrees, as well as lacking about maybe 20 to 30 degrees of terminal flexion on the secondary secondary to the pain here, and you do have a positive lockman exam. So one more thing I want to take a look at real quick, I'm going to take a look at your toes here real quick, very good, so neurovascularly. Your bilateral lower extremities are intact, and it looks like you have a muscle strength of a five out of five. So, Scott, you know, based on my examination here, your right knee injury is really suggestive of anterior cruciate ligamentaire, and you've heard of it probably even heard as ACL tear sometimes, especially when a lot of people do sports, and they injure their knee that that can happen, so my plan for you though, is I want I want to go ahead and order an MRI, because I want to evaluate the integrity of that ACL now. You may need surgery, but we'll first take a look at that MRI result and reevaluate and reevaluate that first, but in the meantime, I want to go ahead and order some anti-inflammatory medication, the locks of cam 50 milligrams a day, it's going to help reduce that swelling and the pain, and then I want you to go ahead and ice the knee if you need to, if you're still seeing some swelling and some pain you can go ahead and use ice as well, but I definitely would like for you to moderate your activities, so I would like for you to wear a knee immobilizer, and then also use crutches when you walk around just to help you a little bit, so not to put too much stress and strain on that knee does that sound like a plan.\n[patient]  It does now. While I need to limit my work activities, I typically sit behind a desk, but it's not been very comfortable sitting here lately.\n[doctor]  Yeah, definitely. So yes, so you can limit the activities for sure. In terms of your work activities, I know if you sit too long sometimes it can be painful because you do need to move that leg a little bit so it doesn't lock up. So I would like for you to do some slight activities not enough to stress your legs, but definitely move them a little bit every now and then so it doesn't lock up on you okay.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Alright, I do want you to, I know you are, I know you actually jog often. So, I want you to just slow that down for a bit, no jogging for a while, until we get you no results of your MRI, until we figure out what we, what we are going to be doing okay.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Alright, and how's your dog you hasn't been jogging with you before the incident?\n[patient]  How just how's my dog or how's my job?\n[doctor]  You're your dog.\n[patient]  Mein, mein, mein, mein, doches O Guy.\n[doctor]  Good.\n[patient]  is doing really well and he enjoys still playing around outside but looks like won't be able to do that for a little bit.\n[doctor]  Very good. Alright, well, I'm going to go ahead and have the nurse take you to the scheduler to get your MRI and I'll get back with you as soon as we get the results of that.\n[patient]  Okay, sound good, thank you.\n[doctor]  Thank you.",

I've been making a ceramic bowl and I'm going to paint it And I have to do some real full decorations, but I've really been working on it a lot and my gosh, This is hurting and I can't work on it right now because it's hurting so much\n[doctor]  I am so sorry. So I mean that's really cool that you do party. It's something that I've wanted to pick up you know, but I don't know that I have those skills yet. Does the pain radiate down your arm or up your shoulder or anything?\n[patient]  It does down my arm and along that inside of my arm.\n[doctor]  Okay, so the medial aspect, okay. Have you did you hit it on anything?\n[patient]  No, not that I recall.\n[doctor]  Okay, and have you ever injured your elbow before?\n[patient]  No, I haven't.\n[doctor]  Okay, alright, so on on a scale of 1 to 10 with 10 being your arm is actively being sought off by a chainsaw how bad is the pain.\n[patient]  Well, I'd say it's about a seven.\n[doctor]  Wow, that's pretty bad. Does it keep you up at night?\n[patient]  Yes, it really does it to know if I roll over and it just wakes me up.\n[doctor]  Okay, have you done anything to relieve the pain?\n[patient]  while I've been taking some ibuprofen, but that isn't really helping.\n[doctor]  Okay, and have you tried anything like ice or heat or anything else?\n[patient]  I tried a little bit of ice at first.\n[doctor]  Hmm.\n[patient]  But, and it's just been hurting for about four days now.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  Didn't get better.\n[doctor]  Okay, okay, so it's probably, it do you think it's getting worse?\n[patient]  Well, it's just not getting better.\n[doctor]  Okay, no, I understand. Okay. So I know that you also have like a history of hypertension and that we have you on 10 milligrams of lysinoprol have you been checking your blood pressures regularly.\n[patient]  Yeah, you know what I remember too. I mean, they've been pretty good 1 teens to 1 30s.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right. And okay, do you think that you've been good about taking your medications? Do you usually take them every day?\n[patient]  Yeah, pretty much I.I. I you know said an alarm for that like centiprol.\n[doctor]  Awesome, that's great alright. And so I see that you also we are treating you for diabetes as well and that we have you on 500 milligrams of metformin twice a day. How about that? Have you been taking that regularly?\n[patient]  Well, sometimes I forget I mean having a medication twice a day. You know sometimes I'm out doing stuff and I just forget to take it.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  and plus I kind of have a sweet tooth. So you know sometimes they're a little bit higher, you know like 150 to 170 so.\n[doctor]  Okay, alright, so when you say a sweet tooth, what are we talking about there?\n[patient]  I love to buck also besides my ceramics. I'm really big and baking and I like to make cakes and then take them to you know parties and get together so you know family get together and I like to make center rules too I've been doing that since I was very young. So I kinda noticed that.\n[doctor]  Okay, cinnamon rolls can be kind of hard like, do you for your cakes? Do you use fondant you know to like, do any of the decorations?\n[patient]  No, I'm either just pretty basic, they're not overly fancy.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  Sipin' Rolls got that recipe out of a Southern Living magazine.\n[doctor]  Oath\n[patient]  A long time ago and...\n[doctor]  So you know it's good.\n[patient]  Yeah.\n[doctor]  Alright, well, so I totally understand like baking and like the excitement of being able to give those to your family. But we maybe want to start cutting down on eating and taste testing ourselves. Is do you think that's something we could manage?\n[patient]  Yeah, I know I need to get better on it. I probably could use maybe a refresher on just managing what I should and shouldn't eat how like if I need to combine a protein. You know if I do eat something a little bit sweet, maybe playing a protein or something with it.\n[doctor]  BOOM! Yeah, that sounds like... hey.\n[patient]  had some friends tell me something about that.\n[doctor]  Yeah, that sounds like a great idea. And I think if that's something that we can maybe discuss to get you in contact with someone who can offer you someone with a degree that can offer you some really good advice. You know, I don't want to as much as it's really helpful to have friends. I do want to be able to give you like a source of truth, right?\n[patient]  Yeah, I had a diabetic consult a long time ago, but it would be nice to see a dietician again and go over those. And maybe there's some new stuff too.\n[doctor]  100% yeah, you know, like I one of the things that I struggle with is like our eggs good for you or bad for you You know like with cholesterol. I feel like it changes every other year or something like that So you're right there Maybe some pieces of information that we do need to update and and you know over a fresh of course wouldn't hurt But if you don't mind I'm gonna go ahead and start my physical exam I'm gonna call out my findings and just go let me know if you have any Questions or if anything sounds anything that you want me to expand on further But this is just for the recording sake so we can get everything documented okay\n[patient]  Yeah, and can I ask you what word were my vital signs? Can you show me what my vital signs were?\n[doctor]  Yeah, that's a really good question. So our big and favorite one is going to be your blood pressure, right? So you're right, like we are seeing some definite improvement today. It was 120 over 70 and honestly, that's a great place to be. So that tells me that your medication is working and that maybe we can start to evaluate a bit more your respiratory rate is completely normal. So I see it here as 18. That's wonderful, you are not running a fever so 97. 9. You're honestly, that's within like a good enough range for me, you're sadding pretty well your oxygen saturation is 100% again. So that means that you're not experiencing any kind of difficulty getting in that oxygen to the rest of your body. I do want to say that you know pain is one of the vitals that we worry about. And you're saying that at its worst you're the pain in your elbow is a 7 out of 10. So that's something that I'm going to evaluate and then your pulse rate seems to be appropriate as well. So those are all great. Do you have any questions about that so far?\n[patient]  Now that sounds good, yeah, I was just curious.\n[doctor]  Yeah\n[patient]  Check it in a while so.\n[doctor]  I do want to say that like looking at you're the weight we do see like maybe a five pound increase from the last time that you were here But that's completely normal right to be able like to fluctuate you know give or take five pounds So I'm not I'm not I'm not like seriously worried about it But if we do come back and notice an additional five pounds then we might have to start talking about like actually You know what let's do that right now what kind of exercise regimen are you on?\n[patient]  While I do go for some walks in the evening, I try to get one in on the morning too.\n[doctor]  Hmm.\n[patient]  So not a whole lot other than that because I'm busy with my pottery or baking, so, but I do try to get out and walk daily.\n[doctor]  Okay, that's awesome, so like how about about how long are your walks?\n[patient]  while I just walk around the neighborhood. There's, you know, the sidewalks. And there's kind of a little bit more of a nature type area that goes across the bridge. And so it's probably, you know, maybe one to two miles a day.\n[doctor]  While that's intense, I was not expecting that number. That's awesome. Okay. All right. So maybe this five pounds is muscle. We're going to go for it. Okay. But thank you. But that's some really important information. But I'm going to start your physical exam now. Okay.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Alright, so I know that you said that you are experiencing elbow pain. Could you tell me is it your left or your right elbow?\n[patient]  It's my ride.\n[doctor]  Okay, alright, right elbow. When I touch it, does it hurt on the inside?\n[patient]  Yes, it does.\n[doctor]  Okay, so moderate tenderness at the medial epicondyle when you turn like when you turn your wrist is if you're trying to open a door knob do you experience pain.\n[patient]  No, not really.\n[doctor]  Alright, so turning out no pain, but when you turn your wrist inwards do you have any pain?\n[patient]  Yeah.\n[doctor]  Okay, so pain with resisted pronation of right form. When you rest your arm on a table with the palm side up, all right, I want you to raise your hand by bending the wrist to experiencing any pain.\n[patient]  Yeah, that hurts.\n[doctor]  Alright alright so when you are when I'm pressing here and like flexing your wrist are you experiencing any pain?\n[patient]  Yes.\n[doctor]  Alright, pain with flexion. And when bending the wrist, alright, when I listen to you, you know I'm just going to check your heart and lungs. Everything sounds good. No murmur, no rub, no gallop, your lungs are clear bilaterally to bilaterally to osculation. I'm not noticing any rash for your Eurolbo. I don't notice any bruising, any swelling. We do want to note that tenderness, but otherwise there is no discoloration, no lesion. So that's good, you're pulses and are equal bilaterally. And I think I think we have an idea of what we're dealing with here. Okay, so I'm going to go ahead and give you my impression and plan for your first problem, like your primary problem that you are here for is right elbow pain. It's consistent with medial epicondylitis and that it just means it's pain caused from overuse and damage to the tendons in your arm. What we are going to do is rest it. I'm going to order a sling for your right arm and you can wear this while you're awake. Well, I want you to apply ice to your elbow for 20 minutes, three times a day. I'm going to ask you to take 600 milligrams of ibuprofen that's three pills every six hours with food and you can take that for one week. I know it's really important that you said that you have something that a gift that you want to make for your son, but we're going to hold off on pottery for the next couple of weeks just to give your arm a chance to heal, you know, like it's awesome that you want to be able to do these things for your family. But sometimes you know your body is not where you're where your where your heart is like where your heart and your head are right and then so.\n[patient]  I'll just let him know that I maybe I'll take a picture of what I have so far.\n[doctor]  Absolutely, that's awesome. And so it'll be like a a movie like coming soon to a shelf near you That's great for your second problem right? We have this long standing diabetes. I want to increase your metformin to a thousand milligrams twice a day I know that you're saying you're having a hard time keeping up with that So I want you to do a good job of like checking and recording your blood sugars every day I do need you to follow up with me in a couple weeks. I also want to order something called in a one-se since you are having a hard time with like the blood like the blood sugars every day and a one-se will give me a more accurate picture of like a longer period of time And then we might need to evaluate like what are what other options that we have if your sugars if we can't get them a bit more under control I do want you to follow up with me in a couple of weeks about the about your diabetes and for your third problem of hypertension We're just going to continue you on your lysinopril at 10 milligrams that's it seems to be doing its job. I'm really I'm really glad about that And it's probably due to the walking that you're doing. I forgot to mention for your diabetes We are going to recommend AA referral to diabetic counseling that way you can get like a bit more information on like the steps that you can take to help you with that\n[patient]  I was going to ask you how about my x-ray, the x-ray of my elbow. How did that look?\n[doctor]  Your x-ray honestly looks great in that I don't see any kind of fracture or bony abnormality. So that's what makes me think that this is like a tendon related thing, right? So in reviewing your x-ray like it, it does support the the assessment and plan that I have given you\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  D.U.\n[patient]  Just true.\n[doctor]  Yeah, absolutely I do think for your primary problem, the elbow, that we might want to get put you in some physical rehab if the problem is taking a little longer to heal, but we'll discuss that at your next visit here, okay?\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  All right, no problem, any other questions.\n[patient]  Nope.\n[doctor]  Alright, thank you for keeping me accountable.",
            "tgt": "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nRight elbow pain.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nTeresa Sullivan is a pleasant 33-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right elbow pain. Her pain began 4 days ago, without any improvement. She denies any specific injury; however, she has recently increased her usage of a pottery wheel in creating a bowl for her son. She is currently unable to work with the pottery wheel secondary to pain. Her pain is in the medial aspect of her elbow. She notes it radiates medially down her arm as well. The patient rates her pain level as 7 out of 10 at its worst. She reports the pain wakes her at night if she rolls over. She denies ibuprofen or ice provide pain relief. The patient denies any previous elbow injuries.\n\nThe patient has a history of hypertension. She states she has been checking her blood pressures regularly. She adds that her blood pressures have been in the 110s to 130s range. She affirms she is taking lisinopril 10 mg daily and denies missing doses.\n\nRegarding her diabetes type 2, she reports she sometimes forgets to take metformin 500 mg twice daily. At times, her blood sugar levels range from 150 to 170 mg/dL. She states that she has a sweet tooth and indulges in home baked goods. For exercise, she walks in the evening and in the morning. She walks 1 to 2 miles per day around her neighborhood.\n\nThe patient enjoys working with ceramics as well as baking cakes and cinnamon rolls for family gatherings.\n\nMEDICAL HISTORY\n\nPatient reports history of hypertension and diabetes type 2.\n\nMEDICATIONS\n\nPatient reports taking lisinopril 10 mg and metformin 500 mg twice daily.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nMusculoskeletal: Reports right elbow pain.\n\nVITALS\n\nBlood Pressure: 120/70 mmHg.\nPulse Rate: Appropriate.\nRespiratory Rate: 18 breaths per minute.\nOxygen Saturation: 100% on room air.\nBody Temperature: 97.9 degrees F.\nPain Level: 7/10 at its worst.\nWeight: 5 lb increase since last visit.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nCV: No murmurs, gallops or rubs.

Hypertension.\n\nPLAN\n\nAfter reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with her regarding her current symptoms. I have explained to her that her elbow pain is consistent with medial epicondylitis and was most likely caused by overuse and damage to the tendons in her arm. I have recommended that we treat the patient conservatively. The patient will wear a sling on her right arm while she is awake to provide increased support. I advised her to ice her right elbow for 20 minutes 3 times per day. She will take ibuprofen 600 mg every 6 hours with food for 1 week. I have also advised her to hold off on creating pottery for the next 2 weeks to allow her arm to heal. If the patient continues to experience persistent elbow pain, we may consider formal physical therapy at her next visit.\n\nI have encouraged the patient to check and record her blood sugars every day. I will increase her metformin to 1000 mg twice a day. The patient and I discussed the importance of her taking her medication on a regular basis twice a day. I have also recommended that she be referred to diabetic counseling for more information on the steps she can take to manage her diabetes. I will also order a hemoglobin A1c test for a more accurate assessment of her long-term blood sugar levels.\n\nThe patient\u2019s hypertension is currently controlled with medication and exercise.

I tried to, you know, I mean medications, but you know some over the counter stuff, but it doesn't go away.\n[doctor]  Okay, can you tell me a little bit more about it? How did it start or how did it do you remember injuring yourself?\n[patient]  No, not really. I mean, I was just like, you know, I guess I one day. I mean, I just twisted, you know, on my left. And maybe I mean, I might have picked something up.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  So I mean at that time, I mean there was this pain, but I you know it went away, you know, and I thought that was You know that was you know the end of it, but you know, I mean after you know a few hours, you know, it's a kind of came back\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  It's been there since then you know.\n[doctor]  Okay, and is it anywhere in specific? Is it in the middle of the back across the whole low back or on one side or the other?\n[patient]  I think it's more towards you know right in the middle maybe on the lower side and nothing on the you know I mean it's sometimes it goes back you know maybe having troubles with the left I suppose but I mean It's aggravated you know when I you know when I do some you know Maybe I'm a sudden movement to the left\n[doctor]  Okay, and that's when you get the pain more, maybe located in the center, but it goes across to the little back and eye on the left side. And I also heard you say, you know, if you twist suddenly, that makes it worse, is that correct.\n[patient]  It makes it worse, it makes it worse on media.\n[doctor]  Now you know I was looking at your records and I know you have that history of diabetes and I haven't seen you a while for follow up for that how you've been feeling.\n[patient]  I mean, been okay. I mean, I take my meds.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  And I try to still have sugar, but you know what I mean?

That's about it.\n[doctor]  Okay, so you're on.\n[patient]  MM\n[doctor]  Yeah, I think I think you're all that met formin twice a day.\n[patient]  Yeah.\n[doctor]  Yeah, okay.\n[patient]  Yes.\n[doctor]  Do you test your blood sugar at home in the mornings?\n[patient]  Yeah, I mean I try to.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  Most of the morning, but sometimes I mean I go skiing, yeah.\n[doctor]  And how have those numbers been?\n[patient]  They bump towards me and bit towards the higher side. I mean, I must have been.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  You know but.\n[doctor]  Well if...\n[patient]  Yeah.\n[doctor]  Yeah, if I remember, write your family, don't they own that that bakery down on the corner of Main Street. And didn't they own that?\n[patient]  Yeah, thank you.\n[doctor]  And how do you stay away from those I got to be honest? I love, I love the cakes and donuts they make those are delicious.\n[patient]  Yeah, I try to.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  But I mean, you know, they, they, you know, I have to visit them. And you know, I end up, you know, I mean getting some stuff, but it's not that much.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  Let's try to contain it, you know.\n[doctor]  Well, let me sew. We're going to have to watch that and I'll come back and we'll talk a little bit about the diabetes. But let's go ahead and do that. I don't want to do a quick physical exam on you. I'm going to look in your eyes here. And so let me quickly look in your ears.\n[patient]  I see.\n[doctor]  Okay, that looks good. And any, let me listen to your lungs. Okay, your lungs are clear. And your heart, it's a regular rate. And rhythm, that's all good as we go through that. Now I want you to sit up here. I'm gonna press down your back starting at the top. And any pain up top, no.\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  Okay, and then once I get down here and around that low back, I want to press in the center first as that cause you a lot of pain.\n[patient]  Yeah.\n[doctor]  Yeah, okay.\n[patient]  Yeah, that's the spot.\n[doctor]  Okay, and if I come over here to the right now.\n[patient]  Not that much you know.\n[doctor]  Okay, so and then on the left hand side if I push down here kind of into your butt.\n[patient]  Yeah.\n[doctor]  Yeah, okay.\n[patient]  Yeah.\n[doctor]  Lay back on the stretcher for me for a second. I'm going to go ahead and lift your legs for me or I'm going to go ahead and lift your legs for you. Just relax. I'm going to start here on the right side when I lift that right leg up. Does that cause you significant pain or any pain at all?\n[patient]  a little bit.\n[doctor]  Okay, let me come around, let me lift up the left side. If I lift that up, does that cause?\n[patient]  Yeah, you're dead, that's...\n[doctor]  Yeah\n[patient]  Still get tender, yeah.\n[doctor]  I can see that grits on your face, so okay, that's good. And you know as I look at your lower extremities, there's no pain or numbness or tingling in your feet, or anything like that.\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  Okay, okay, so let me talk a little bit about my impression and plan. So for that low back pain, I believe you have a musculoskeletal low back strain. I'm going to order a low back x-ray. So we'll order that and get that done as an outpatient. I don't expect to see anything significant, but it's going to tell me how those joint spaces look. And if you know if we're dealing with any disc issue, but that will be the start of it. And I'm also going to order some physical therapy too for two reasons to help with a little bit with the pain, but also strengthen some of the muscles there in the back. So those are the two things that we are going to do now. I want you to take take 400 milligrams of ibuprofen. You can take that occasionally with some Tylenol. When the pain gets more severe up to about three times a day, I'm going to also give you a prescription for some flexoril that's a muscle relaxant. And I want you to take one of those once a day every evening. But be careful if you're doing any strenuous or hazardous activities, such as driving after you take those now for your diabetes. My impression is that your diabetes is as under control. I noticed that we don't have in had a one C for almost five months. So I'm also going to order an A1C so we can find out where we are with that continue with your diet and exercise. We know that's really important. And then continue with your metformin. I'm not going to make any changes today, but we'll go ahead and look at that once I get that results of that A1C to you. Have any questions for me.\n[patient]  yet can i still go to the bakery\n[doctor]  I would yes, it's nice for you to go to the bakery, but you can't have any donuts. I'm no I you just really need to watch that intake of anything that you might get at the at the bakery. So just be careful with those carbohydrates, those sweets that you're taking as we go through your day. It's occasional occasional one perfectly fine, but on a routine basis, we need to watch that.\n[patient]  Right, and how soon should I know check my blood sugars? I mean, what's good you know?\n[doctor]  Yeah, that's a great question. I'm really glad you asked that I would prefer that you're taking your blood pressure. Every morning, the first thing you get up when you get up in the morning, that's going to give me a good idea. And so if you can do that the first thing in the morning and keep a record of it, you know, I know your glucometer keeps a record of it, but if you can write them down. And once we get that, a one-see that's going to give me a little more guidance. On how to deal with your blood, your diabetes.\n[patient]  Why do you think what I need to see, you know, a pain doctor or, you know,\n[doctor]  Not yet, let's get that that's a great question. I'm end up referring you to a pain doctor for that low back pain, but I really would like to start with some of the diagnostics first. Let's get an x-ray. And if there is, you know any question of that x-ray. And the pain continues. I'm going to go ahead and maybe order a cat scan. And then at that point in time, we can refer you to a pain doctor if we're still having significant pain.\n[patient]  Sounds good.\n[doctor]  Okay, thank you. I'm going to send my nursing to see you and we'll get you out the door.\n[patient]  Thank you.\n[doctor]  Take care.\n[patient]  That one is a follow up mm.",

I the medical assistant told me that you injured your knee.\n[patient]  Yeah, I heard it stepping off a curb.\n[doctor]  How long ago did that happen?\n[patient]  about two and a half weeks ago.\n[doctor]  two and a half weeks ago and what what knee is bothering you.\n[patient]  The right knee, the outside of my right knee.\n[doctor]  the outside of your right knee.\n[patient]  Yeah.\n[doctor]  Okay, and did you actually fall down when this happened or?\n[patient]  Now I just sort of turn over my ankle.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  to the outside and I thought my ankle was the thing that was in a hurt most but after the ankle soreness went away the only my knee hurt and it sort of clicks when I walk\n[doctor]  And no, okay. So now it clicks when you walk. Okay, does it hurt when you walk?\n[patient]  No unless I stand on one foot for an extended period of time, like leaning my foot up against the wall.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  Then I feel like it's locked, and then I sort of have to ease into walking again.\n[doctor]  Okay, and what have you taken for the paint?\n[patient]  Really nothing.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  I'd be profan, but I'm not a big pill taker, so I sort of sucked it up and...\n[doctor]  Does the ibuprofen work?\n[patient]  At night, you know, during the day, I'm more active. So it really doesn't impact it, because I just work through it. But at night, it does help me to settle down and sleep better.\n[doctor]  Does your knee hurt when you're just resting and sitting there?\n[patient]  No, once up it's fine when it's down on the floor with my foot flat. It's fine. It does hurt when I rest it on my heel.\n[doctor]  Okay, and are you able to do things like bending or things like that?\n[patient]  A full squat, that's when I feel the most clicking like. If I go all the way down to a full squat like a catcher that's when I feel the most clicking, but otherwise no, there's no pain, it's just the clicking, and I'm fearful that that's an injury of some type.\n[doctor]  Okay, alright now you said squats or you are you active or you doing like burpees going to?\n[patient]  Now I ride the bike.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  I ride the bike, I ride the bike, which I'm not doing now pellet and inside for the winter. I do have a winter bike though.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right, well, I have a peloton who is your favorite instructor.\n[patient]  I actually don't have a favorite instructor, I have more favorite rides.\n[doctor]  Okay, what kind of rides do you like?\n[patient]  I like rock music and regain music rides, so whoever is doing those in a began or a medium content I'm cool with.\n[doctor]  I can't picture you as a Reggade person, so that's interesting to know okay. All right, and any numbing or tingling in your foot at all.\n[patient]  Yes, but not from any injury, I broke my foot my second toe on my right foot, and I have numbness depending upon the shoe I wear.\n[doctor]  Okay, when did you break your toe?\n[patient]  I've broken it three times over the last ten years, so it's just something that's an annoyance, but it wasn't caused by this injury.\n[doctor]  Okay, so you do have some numbing and tingling, but it's not new.\n[patient]  Right, correct.\n[doctor]  Alright, alright, well let's just go ahead and I'm going to go ahead and do a quick physical exam. I'm going to be calling out my exam findings. I'll let you know what that means. So on your musculoskeletal exam on your right knee, I do appreciate some slight edema. You do have a slight effusion. Does it hurt when I press on the outside of your knee?\n[patient]  No, not physically.\n[doctor]  Okay, there is no pain to palpation of the right lateral knee. I'm going to be bending your knee in all sorts of positions. Does that hurt?\n[patient]  only when you pull it to the outside.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  From my my foot, when you pull it to the outside that the only time it hurts.\n[doctor]  Okay, the patient has a positive aeroist test. There's full range of motion. There is a negative lockman sign. The patient does on cardiovascular exam. The patient does have a palpable door salis pedis and posterior to be allis pulse. Okay. Well, let's just I want to talk a little bit about I had the nurse do an x-ray on you. And I looked at the results of your knee x-ray. And it doesn't show any acute fracture or bony abnormality, which is not surprising based on your injury. So let's just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and my plan for you. So I think you do have a lateral a lateral collateral ligament strain based on your exam findings. And this this type of injury essentially can be healed by itself. You know, I don't think we're going to need to refer you to surgery or anything like that. I want you to go ahead and I'm going to prescribe maloxicam 15 milligrams once a day. I do want to go ahead and refer you to physical therapy because if we strengthen up those muscles and areas around that injury, then that will make your knee stronger. It help prevent future injuries. Are you able to ice it at all during the day? Now you said you're working you work in sales, so you said you're home.\n[patient]  Yeah, I actually am a home, so I can ice it and I have been icing it.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  I mean, 20 on 20 off at least four times a day.\n[doctor]  Okay, and so does that help at all.\n[patient]  It makes it feel better in the morning when I first go to my desk. And at the end of the day before bed, you know, I take ibuprofen, so I don't have swelling overnight, but honestly, I have a pretty decent threshold for pain. So it's not good, it's not changing it by much.\n[doctor]  Okay, do you feel like your symptoms are getting worse or better? I think I think pretty much for the last two weeks they've remained about the same, that the only time I feel like they get worse is when I exert myself doing up and down like gardening in the yard or moving pots.\n[patient]  and stuff outside that the only time I felt like it got any worse, but nothing to the point where it stayed worse.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right, well, let's go ahead and refer you to physical therapy. If you're still having pain, then we might have to consider an MRI.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Any questions about that?\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  Okay, alright well it was very nice seeing you today call me if you need anything.\n[patient]  I will.\n[doctor]  Okay, bye.\n[patient]  Bye.",

Do you get that severe pain or is it mainly on the right?\n[patient]  No, it's mainly just on the right.\n[doctor]  Okay, so I'm going to just hold your leg here and I want you to take your foot and ankle and I want you to go ahead and just pull your toes up towards you does that create some pain when you do that.\n[patient]  Yeah, a little bit.\n[doctor]  A little bit okay, now I'm just gonna hold your foot up and I want you to push against me. And does that hurt?\n[patient]  Yeah, that hurts a little bit too.\n[doctor]  Yeah, okay, okay, roll over here on my my stretcher for me and I want you to dangle your your feet over the edge And what I want to do is I just want I'm gonna squeeze your left calf first and when I do that does that hurt on your left side\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  and I'm going to squeeze on the right side anything there.\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  Okay, okay, well that's good to do your Thompson test is negative that's a really good finding and I just want to continue pressing here on your right from your heel when I squeeze your heel does that cause significant pain at all.\n[patient]  Yeah.\n[doctor]  Yeah, okay. And if I come up a little bit further as I run up that Achilles tendon does that hurt?\n[patient]  That's real tender.\n[doctor]  Yeah, okay, okay. Great, not great. So, yeah, go ahead and sit up for me. So, Dennis, my diagnosis is Achilles tendonitis. And it's really from overuse when we see this frequently. When somebody starts to you know, get in and train aggressively. For an event I'm unfortunately, I'm going to have to ask you to stop training for AA week or two I know that's concerning. But I really want this to heal before we move into that next phase. I didn't ask you about medication, but I'm assuming whatever you were doing wasn't working significantly. So, what I'd like you to do is take some ibuprofen or advelle that's the same medication. And I want you to take three tablets every six hours. And that's really an anti-inflammatory. See, if we can eliminate some of that tendonitis type pain that you're getting that inflammation around that Achilles tendon, I'm going to also order a couple physical therapy visits. And the reason for that is I'd like you to get some strength and stretching understanding. I think it's important for you, especially here at the beginning is to get some of that Rayal stretching knowledge in and learn how to stretch those muscles before you start these activities. And they're going to help strengthen your lower extremities also. And I want you to come back to me within you know a week to 10 days following your first couple physical therapy appointments. So I can monitor how you're doing. I see no reason for an x-ray at this point, but if this continues, we're going to you know if you're still having pain 10 days and significant pain without change modification of your activity. Then we may have to look at more aggressive treatment plans. How does that sound for you?\n[patient]  Sounds good.\n[doctor]  Okay, hey did you happen to catch that Pittsburgh ping one hockey game last night?\n[patient]  No, I was watching the track meet.\n[doctor]  My gosh, the the paying ones are on fire, you know they beat up on New York 7-2. I mean the hockey is just an amazing sport. I just do guide you do a lot of hockey down there in town here.\n[patient]  used to when I lived in Detroit.\n[doctor]  Oh\n[patient]  Hockey town, but not so much anymore.\n[doctor]  No yet a troid is a hockey town yet the red wings okay well i'm gonna go ahead and i'll send my nurse in and go ahead and get you discharged and like i said i'd like to see you back here in seven to ten days after that first physical therapy appointment i've got a great phenomenal office staff you just call in once they get scheduled they will get you into that next available appointment so take care and i will talk to you later\n[patient]  Thanks.",
            "tgt": "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nDennis Martin is a pleasant 46-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right heel pain. The onset of his pain began 10 days ago while training for a triathlon. He locates his pain to the posterior aspect of his heel, which radiates proximally into his calf. His pain is aggravated by working out and when he first gets up in the morning. If he sits for a long period, his pain will return upon standing. The patient states that he runs 10 kilometers in the morning. At lunchtime, he tries to get on a bike for about 45 minutes to an hour. In the evening, he goes to the aquatic center and swims for 30 minutes to 1 hour. The patient states that he runs 5 days per week. He adds that he alternates between a long run and a long bike ride on weekends. He currently takes one day off from his exercises. The patient states that he does not stretch at all. He denies any left leg pain.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nMusculoskeletal: Reports right heel pain. Denies left leg pain.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nMSK: Examination of the right heel: Pain with resisted extension. Mild pain with flexion. Positive calcaneal squeeze test. Severe tenderness to the Achilles tendon. Thompson test is negative, bilaterally.\n\nRESULTS\n\nNo new imaging was obtained today\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nRight Achilles tendinitis.\n\nPLAN\n\nAfter reviewing the patient's examination today, I had a lengthy discussion with the patient regarding his current symptoms. I have explained to him that his symptoms are likely secondary to overuse. I have recommended that we treat the patient conservatively. The patient was instructed to take at least 1 week off from his training to recover from this. I will provide him with a referral for formal physical therapy to strengthen his right lower extremities. I have advised him to take 3 tablets of ibuprofen every 6 hours for pain. If his pain does not improve with physical therapy, I will recommend obtaining an x-ray.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nThe patient will follow up with me in 7 to 10 days to check on his progress.",

            "src": "[doctor]  So hey Christina, good to see you today. I see you're here. You have a non-healing footser. Well, also looks like in my notes that you got some you've got type 2 diabetes and that probably the reason for your ear, but also not healing. So how are you doing today? What's going on?\n[patient]  Doing pretty good except I can't get this ulcer to heal.\n[doctor]  Okay, how long has that wound been present?\n[patient]  Maybe about a year.\n[doctor]  A year well that that's a that's a a long time so when it started I guess did you have any trauma to the foot or did was it just all of a sudden\n[patient]  No trauma, it just seemed like a little blister and then I picked at it and it did get a little bit red and infected. So I talked to my primary about it.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  I went on some antibiotics, it seemed to get better, but nothing is really making it go away.\n[doctor]  Okay, when was the last time you were on antibiotics?\n[patient]  It's probably been five months.\n[doctor]  Five months, all right, do you remember which antibiotics you were on?\n[patient]  Keflex\n[doctor]  Keflex, alright, so kind of does your foot hurt or is it just just the...\n[patient]  No pain, but I don't have much feeling in my foot.\n[doctor]  Alright, so you've got neuropathy yet, that that makes sense with the diabetes. So have you had any other symptoms like a fever chills any drainage coming from it?\n[patient]  Lately there has been a lot more drainage and I just feel a little more tired.\n[doctor]  Okay alright well that sounds good so today is Thursday so what do you have for the weekend?\n[patient]  Not too much, I'll probably be walking around in the zoo on this ulcer all weekend and eating out and not doing anything my doctor wants me to do.\n[doctor]  No, yeah, yeah, I know you do have that diabetes. I know your PCP probably wouldn't be excited about you eating out and all that, but you know, hopefully we can we eye can at least get your foot a little bit better. So your diabetes, I know we talked a little bit earlier. How is that going for you? Is it controlled? You know, what's your blood sugar's running?\n[patient]  Yeah, they're running better than they were, but they're still in the 200, so my doctor doesn't like that my last A1C was about 10.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right, yeah, I you probably definitely need to get back with your PCP about that because the A1C is is pretty high and I know he probably had you on some medication and insulin and metformin and insulin just to try to get that lower but\n[patient]  Yes.\n[doctor]  You know, we are here for your foot. So let's let me take a look at that. So we will do a quick exam of your foot. So you don't have any fever. Your vitals look good. So on your your right foot exam, I can see here you do have a one by two centimeter, two inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of a lateral right foot. So it's just proximal to the fifth MDP joint. I do see some yellow slew that's present with minimal granulation tissue. You have no surrounding erythema or cellulitis, and there isn't any evidence of fluid collection. I don't see necrosis. So there is no dead tissue around it. There's no odor, and I don't appreciate any bony exposure. And does it hurt when I touch it here?\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  Okay, so we did an x-ray of your right foot before you came in, and it showed no evidence of osteomyelitis that means that there is no bone infection, which is really good. So let me just talk a little about my assessment and plan of your foot. So you do have that diabetic foot ulcer. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to order a ABI or ankle-brakel index, and that's just to determine your blood supply, just to see if we can. Actually, heel that wound I know it's been there for about a year, which is a pretty long time, and so we just need to see if we can if you do have that blood flow. Just in case we needed to make other goals for that foot, just to depend upon that I'm also going to do a debridement here, have you had that done before of the...\n[patient]  Yes, I think so.\n[doctor]  Okay, so you know, you know pretty much about that. So I'm just going to try to take off some of that dead tissue we'll do that here in the office afterwards. And then I'm going to prescribe you some collagenase ointment. And you could just add that to your wound once a day and cover it with a sterile dressing. And we're going to try to continue that until we see it start to shrink. And hopefully you know that will work between the debridement. And then the ointment did. They give you at your PCP they give you a surgical shoe or have you been wearing your regular shoes?\n[patient]  I've just been wearing my regular shoes.\n[doctor]  Okay, so we're going to get you a surgical shoe and I want you to wear that and that can help you take pressure off the area because I know you said you're going to walk around with a sews this weekend. So I definitely don't want you to put much pressure on it from now on and hopefully they can help it heal. And so after all that I'm just going to see you back in two weeks and we could take another look and possible do another debridement of the ulcer. So do you have any questions for me?\n[patient]  I don't think so.\n[doctor]  Alright so I'll see you back in two weeks and I hope you're fun at the zoo this weekend.\n[patient]  Thank you.\n[doctor]  Alright, thanks.",

So you've been coming to see me for a while now ever since you had an RCA STEM place back in 2018, but I see you're here for follow up after an interior STEMI, where we had to put in another STEM right so like how are you doing?\n[patient]  While me was a real shock for me, I thought everything was fine after my last heart attack. And then I just started having this horrible chest pain and it wouldn't go away. So I went to the emergency room and yet they told me I needed another stint.\n[doctor]  Wow, so you were experiencing similar symptoms similar to what you had the first time.\n[patient]  Yeah, it was, yeah, it was bad, it was just like the last time.\n[doctor]  Okay, have you had any chest pain or shortness of breath?\n[patient]  Now I think I saw you about six months ago and I was doing fine.\n[doctor]  Okay, have you been able to like exercise at all since you last saw me?\n[patient]  You know I walk my dog every day and you know we go like a mile and a half or two miles.\n[doctor]  Awesome, okay. Yeah, you know because like fall is setting in like are you excited?\n[patient]  Yeah, I'm excited.\n[doctor]  Do you have any like plans for the holiday?\n[patient]  No, I'm a mum. No. I'm just, you know, looking forward to seeing family and having some nice weather and yeah.\n[doctor]  Okay, so I do want to ask I know that you have a history of coronary artery disease hypertension and diabetes. So I want to get an idea of where you stand with those have you been experiencing any kind of leg swelling.\n[patient]  I have noticed that my legs are a little swollen since they sent me home from the hospital.\n[doctor]  Okay, are you able to lie flat at night when you sleep?\n[patient]  I mean I always use a couple of pillows, you know, I maybe I've had to sit up a little bit more. But I mean for the most part one, think it's pretty normal.\n[doctor]  Okay, and then have you been able to afford your medications and are you taking them like you're like you were prescribed?\n[patient]  Yeah, I'm able to afford to afford them. I have good insurance. I am taking them. They told me it's really important to take them so, so yeah.\n[doctor]  Yeah, that's very accurate. You know, like there are huge consequences to not taking them. So if you are noticing any problems, please, please, please, please, let us know how about your diet, are you watching your salt intake?\n[patient]  I mean, I'm not eye-eye, I haven't really adjusted. I mean, I tried to watch it after the last heart attack. And now, you know, I've kind of been less strict with my diet, but I'll have to go back to watching the salt intake.\n[doctor]  Hmm.\n[patient]  I love pizza, it's my favorite food.\n[doctor]  Yeah\n[patient]  I try to problem my second favorite food.\n[doctor]  What are you for her toppings on pizza?\n[patient]  Pepperoni occasionally vegetables.\n[doctor]  I'm not even more right, but you know that pepperoni is pretty high in salt on top of a cheesy pizza right.\n[patient]  I know I know I'm gonna work on it.\n[doctor]  Okay, so we are going to have to negotiate some of these diet things, and then especially since you have diabetes, like have you been managing that well?\n[patient]  My I've been watching my sugars yet because I don't want to go on insulin so I'm taking that met form in that's why I've been walking my dog I'm trying to stay active\n[doctor]  Okay, okay, so you know maybe this is just a situation of like where we are on the right path, but probably need to step up a few things, okay?\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Alright, so I do want to do a quick physical exam, so you are aware I'm going to be calling out my findings as I run through it alright.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Alright, so your vital signs look good, you know? So I'm glad that it looks like you're tolerating your medication pretty well on your neck exam. I don't appreciate any jugular venous distension, so... And then on top of that, I'm not, I don't appreciate any carotid roots, so... I'm not feeling anything like too concerning on your heart exam, though. There is a three over six-histolic ejection murmur heard, at that I'm hearing, at the left base. That's not like a huge deal, especially considering, like, what? You've been through already in terms of the hospital, but it is something that I want to know in your chart when I listen to your lungs, your lungs are clear over here with your extremities. I do notice, you know, some lower, lower edema swelling, sorry, some lower swelling, edema lower, lymphedema. And it is pitting one plus on your right radial artery, the cath side is clean dry, and intact without hematoma, and I also your right radial artery. Pulses are palpable, so I did review the results of your EKG, and they show a normal sinus rhythm and a good, our wave progression. NAA evolutionary changes that are anticipated after STEMI, one of the reasons, though, that we had you come in, is that we noticed on your echo, there is a reduced ejection fraction of 35%, we are a little bit concerned about that, so let's talk about my assessment and plan for you your primary. And like, first diagnosis is going to be coronary artery disease, right? You already have a history of that, but you know, we're going to do some things to make. We're going to continue to evaluate that over time I want you to continue your aspirin 81 milligrams daily, and your Berlin to 90 milligrams twice daily. I want to continue you on a high dose statin called lipitor, and you're going to be taking that 80 milligrams a day, and we're going to continue you on your toprol, and that's going to be 50 milligrams daily. I am going to refer you to cardiac rehab, so we can get you some education and give you some confidence to. Get back to exercising regularly, I know it was kind of scary to have such an episode, but I promise like most of the patients I have love cardiac rehab, and I think you'll do pretty well for your second diagnosis. We have newly, you have newly reduced left ventricular dysfunction, and moderate mitral regurgitation. What I think is like what that means is that you're pumping like the way that your heart is pumping is a bit. Concerning, but I think like given your history that it will improve over. Time they got you into the cath lab pretty quickly, so I think that the muscle is just kind of like stunned, like surprised. And since you're compliant with your meds, I think you will recover. We're going to continue you on your Lycinoprol 20 milligrams daily, however, considering that you are retaining fluid. I think that your third diagnosis is like we are crossing into acute heart failure. I'm going to prescribe something called a diuretics called LASIX, and I do want to we need to take that 40 milligrams. Once a day, I want to add all Dactone 12, 5 milligrams daily, and I need you to get labs. Finally, we will repeat another echo in about two months last, but not least there is the hypertension, your blood pressure. Seems fine. I think with the L Dactone that you'll tolerate that pretty well, but we do want to maybe get you into some nutrition counseling to consider, like what other diet options might be available to you, maybe suggestions of things that you haven't thought about like cutting out. Meet especially any kind of preserved meat like pepperoni, but maybe finding you some alternatives, how does that sound?\n[patient]  That sounds good, yeah. So I'm here as long as you tell me I'm gonna get better, I believe you.\n[doctor]  Yes, yeah, I strongly believe this is our best course of action and that you'll get better given enough time. I see that you're making efforts. I'm really glad that you're out there walking and that you're cognizant of your diet and willing to make changes. We will just do you know monitor it over time, okay?\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  All right, thank you.",

            "src": "[doctor]  Hey Jose, how are you doing? It's been about you know three or four months since I last saw you what's going on.\n[patient]  I'm doing okay. I guess the medications are helping I'm concerned about all the medications I'm taking, but I think I'm doing okay.\n[doctor]  Yeah, yeah, you are on a fair amount of medications. You know, we do have you on those medications because you did have a heart attack about six months ago. They put that that stand into your left anterior descending artery. And so that's a major artery on the left side of your heart. And so we need to keep those stents open and then kind of help your heart heal. So it is going to be very important for you to continue on those medications. So you're still taking your aspirin. And are you still taking the brilinta?\n[patient]  Yes, and fish oil.\n[doctor]  And fish oil. Okay, good now how are you doing with the crere store? I know that that's you know that's the statin, that's the cholesterol medication you were concerned that it might cause you to have some muscle aches or you're taking that.\n[patient]  I think I'm doing good, but I might feel like I, when I guess the only complaint that I have is ever since I don't know if this is a heart attack, or if this is the medication, but when I stand up real fast, I get really dizzy.\n[doctor]  You get you get dizzy, okay? Yeah, you know, we do have you on what we call a beta block or metaprolol. I think your dose is 50 milligrams once a day, and you know, sometimes it takes a little bit for your body to adjust to that. But yes, if you stand up too quickly, it can cause you to be a little dizzy, so...\n[patient]  Okay, okay, that makes sense, okay. That's good to know, because I didn't know what the problem was so can I ask you a question regarding the stance?\n[doctor]  Yep.\n[patient]  How long do I have to have that in there?\n[doctor]  So the stents are permanent, we don't remove them so yet. So that's why it's going to be super important for you. You know you're going to be on aspirin for the rest of your life. And then I'm going to keep you on that Berlinta for another six months that's going to help prevent that stent from clogging.\n[patient]  Okay, okay, do I need to ever replace the stance then?\n[doctor]  No, I mean, every so often the stents can become narrowed again. But you know that's why you're seeing me or cardiologist, so that I can follow you for that now if you start to have symptoms again of any chest pain like you had before or any shortness of breath. When you start to exert yourself, I want you to tell me and we might have to go ahead and send you for further testing to make sure that those stents are okay. But typically if you continue to take the medication, watch your diet that type of thing. Your stents will stay open for a long time.\n[patient]  Okay, all right, that sounds good, you know. I haven't had, hey, I had I know you asked me to follow up with a dietician because I had diabetes as well, which probably contributed to my heart attack.\n[doctor]  Yeah\n[patient]  I'm any new order, I don't know who I forgot who I was supposed to talk to.\n[doctor]  Okay, that's okay. Yeah, I certainly can help you with that now. Managing your diabetes is also going to play an important role in your coronary artery disease, which it sounds like you already know that which is really good. So I will put in another referral for diabetic education for you. How are you doing watching your sweets? I know that you know you do have an affinity for those chocolate chip cookies.\n[patient]  It's okay my one C wasn't where I wanted, but my glucose is coming in about 130.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  Fasting.\n[doctor]  Okay, what was the what was the A1c, the hemoglobin, A1c if you don't mind me asking?\n[patient]  I thought it was close to 60.\n[doctor]  Okay, yeah, that's really high, so we want it to be about 6, so you do have some work to do with your diet.\n[patient]  Yeah, so okay, so I know you asked me to do a blood test, so I did that I was wondering if you got the results.\n[doctor]  I did you know I looked at the results of your kidney function that's what we call your creatinine just because you had some contrast dye and sometimes contrast dye can impact the kidneys and your kidney function is stable, which is great when was the last time you saw your nephrologist.\n[patient]  Oh\n[doctor]  That's your kidney doctor.\n[patient]  I'm a bad, I'm a bad patient, so probably a year ago.\n[doctor]  Okay, you know you do have the Stage 3 CKD. So that's the Stage 3 kidney disease. So it is going to be important for you to follow up with your nephrologist just to make sure that everything is okay. Now I did check your kidney function and it was fine, but are you staying away from things like Motrin and AdVal?\n[patient]  Right, yeah, that's I threw all of those out.\n[doctor]  Okay, good, okay, perfect. Now I know that you're from the West Coast, are you super excited that law won the Super Bowl? Or are you more of a San Francisco 49 or a span?\n[patient]  I'm a more of San Francisco fan.\n[doctor]  So, do you like Jimmy G? Do you think he can beat Aaron Rogers again?\n[patient]  Okay, we'll see what happens, but I'm pretty flexible when he comes to you know that is, but one thing that since I can't take Motrin, what pain killer can I take for headaches.\n[doctor]  You can take Tylenol.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Yeah\n[patient]  Alright, that sounds good.\n[doctor]  Yeah\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  This is I don't think I have any other question. The only thing I'm going to need is I need some refills on my medications.\n[doctor]  Yeah, I can do that, but I do want to just do a physical exam on you, okay? So, and looking here at your vital signs here, you know your vital signs look quite good. You know your blood pressure is what right where it should be. It's about 127 over 80, which is great. So you're doing a good job taking your metaprolol now in terms of on your neck exam. I don't appreciate any jugular venous distension or carotid roots on your heart exam. I do appreciate a slight three out of six isolic ejection murmur heard at the left base. And on your lower extremity exam, I do appreciate some one plus non-pitting edema now. What does that mean? What does that mean? Jose. So all of that means is that I do hear a little heart murmur on your heart, which I've heard before in the past. And it doesn't, it doesn't look like you're retaining any fluid, which is good, but you do have a little puffiness in your legs, which sometimes some of the medications can cause.\n[patient]  Yeah, I do have that.\n[doctor]  So let's just go over a little bit about my assessment and plan for you going forward. So for your first problem of your coronary artery disease, I think you're doing really well, I want to go ahead and refer you for cardiac rehab just so that you can be more active and have some confidence in exercising again. Okay, and I am going to go ahead and refill your metaprolol your Crestor 40 milligrams once a day as well. As the aspirin, okay, I don't think we need to proceed with a stress test or anything at this time, but you know to let me know if you have any symptoms okay.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Okay for your\n[patient]  Sounds really good.\n[doctor]  Good for your second problem of your stage, three chronic kidney disease. I am going to reach out to Dr. Miller and make an appointment for you to be seen. Just because again, I think it's important for you to follow up with your nephrologist okay.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  And then for your third problem of your diabetes, I am going to go ahead and order another hemoglobin A1c. And I'm going to put that referral in for the dietician to give you some dietary education. And I'm going to go ahead and talk with your primary care physician about your insulin regimen, okay?\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Any questions?\n[patient]  You know I've been kind of down ever since I had my heart attack, is there any medication that I could take to make me feel a little bit less sad?\n[doctor]  Yeah, I mean are you having any thoughts of harming yourself or harming others?\n[patient]  No, no, I just feel kind of down.\n[doctor]  You feel kind of down what's your?\n[patient]  Life sucks.\n[doctor]  What well I don't think, so what's your support system like?\n[patient]  You know I live with my dog and that's it so it's kind of you know lonely.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right, well, would you be interested in in like a referral to psychiatry or something like that so that you have someone to talk to about some of the issues because medication can help but I do I think it's important to have you know talk some of these things out.\n[patient]  Okay, you know I'll give that a try, I mean I'm retiring, I got plenty of time.\n[doctor]  Okay, so why don't we go ahead and I'm going to place a referral to psychiatry for you know, you know, difficulty adjusting after having a heart attack. Maybe some some mild depression. Okay, does that sound okay? Okay.\n[patient]  Yeah, that sounds really good, thank you.\n[doctor]  Okay you're welcome, anything else.\n[patient]  So you will do the medication refill, do I. So that's automatic.\n[doctor]  Yep, I'm going to put them into the computer and whatever pharmacy you want, you have them.\n[patient]  Okay, all right sounds great. Thank you.\n[doctor]  Okay you're welcome I'll be in touch bye.\n[patient]  Okay, all right, bye-bye.",

            "src": "[doctor]  Yes, so sorry so Barbara is a 31 year old female and she has history of diabetes type 2 and asthma and she is here today with abdominal pain. So Barbara tell me a little more about your abdominal pain what's been going on.\n[patient]  So I've been having this pain for the past one week. And as you know, I have a long standing history of diabetes. And I guess I've been drinking too much coffee lately. I don't know if that trigger my gastritis so.\n[doctor]  Yeah\n[patient]  I think it's been but lately.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right. And so is it increasing in severity would you say or staying about the same or what?\n[patient]  It's gradually increasing for sure.\n[doctor]  Okay, alright, and along with the pain have you had any nausea or vomiting or diarrhea?\n[patient]  Naja and vomiting is on and off.\n[doctor]  Hmm.\n[patient]  So I would say I've experienced nausea for about like three times in the past week.\n[doctor]  Okay, okay, and so, and you vomited how many times?\n[patient]  A couple of times.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right, been drinking a lot of coffee you said to her, is that is that Starbucks, I love those nitro-caliberus and Starbucks, we ever had those, those are incredible.\n[patient]  Yeah.\n[doctor]  That's...\n[patient]  Endo de 20.\n[doctor]  Yeah, the for sure you got to go veneon that you really have to coax them into it, though they won't even give you. It's like you need a license to get a veneon that that nitro is so strong, so that's my Achilles heel I tell you. But okay, so you think that might have you think maybe coffee contributed to your abdominal pain, a yee you've been drinking more coffee, and maybe that's related as you're thinking.\n[patient]  Yeah, I think so because I started last week and toward the end of last week my coffee intake was pretty bad. So I've been controlling myself this week and you know I probably just had one cup.\n[doctor]  Okay, yeah, okay. And so is the pain in your upper abdomen or where in your abdomen is it?\n[patient]  It's on both the sides of my upper abdomen.\n[doctor]  I'm okay.\n[patient]  So I'd also increases when I work out like if I want a jog or like go for run my abdominal pain, just like spikes, you know, so I have to take it easy.\n[doctor]  Okay, alright understood. You've not had any fever with that pain have you.\n[patient]  No, I haven't.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right, and so how about your diabetes? How's your diabetes been doing? How your blood sugar has been? What low 100s to 200s? Where where is it?\n[patient]  I think it's been under control, it's 800 so.\n[doctor]  Okay, good. And you're still taking them at 4,500 milligrams. Once a day, right now, actually, it looks like last visit we increased that to 500 milligrams twice per day. Is that correct?\n[patient]  Yes, that's probably helping me keeping it under control so.\n[doctor]  Okay, good good. And then for your asthma, have you had any recent asthma attacks? And are you still taking the flow vent twice a day and are all butyl as needed for wheezing?\n[patient]  Yes, but sometimes I forget, you know, I haven't had any asthma attacks lately, so I just figured I could decrease.\n[doctor]  Yep, okay.\n[patient]  I think that's a good decision though.\n[doctor]  Yeah, well, better to stay on the flow vent daily, and then just use the albuterol if you need it, but if you stay on the flow vent daily, it will decrease the frequency of those attacks. So, yeah, all right, well, let's go ahead and examine you okay. So on your physical exam, it's pretty normal for the most part, unremarkable. But I all say on your on your heart exam, you do still have a grade three out of six systolic ejection murmur that's unchanged from your prior exam. And I'm not worried about that. We're kind of watching that, but it just means I hear some heart sounds when your valves are moving. And otherwise normal heart exam for your domino exam, you do have mild tenderness in the epigastrium of your abdomen, your abdomens. Otherwise, soft, there's no tenderness in the right lower quadrant whatsoever. And there is no significant tenderness in the right upper quadrant. So I think you know that's right where your stomach is in the upper abdomen. So I think that you know that maybe you may be right, this could be some gastritis. So then otherwise on your exam on your lung exam, you do have some mild end expiratory weasers very faint and otherwise normal lung exam with excellent air movement and otherwise pretty normal physical exam. So let's talk about your my assessment and your plan here. So first of all for the first problem of the abdominal pain, I do think that you have acute gastritis. And I think this is probably related to the caffeine intake. And I know that you've had AA, moderately heavy history of alcohol use too. So I wanted to cut back on the alcohol as well. You know, keep that down to a dull roller like maybe keep that less than two or three drinks a week would be great. And then also cut back on the caffeine. And that should help. And I'm going to write you a prescription for Xantac as well as we need. And so I'll write you a prescription you can take that twice a day that should help with the acid in your stomach and the pain. And then I'm going to check A your analysis, a urine pregnancy test, a CBC, a comprehensive metabolic panel as well. And we'll see what those results show just to be sure it's nothing else going on. And then for your second problem of diabetes type two, let's continue you on the metformin. But I want to adjust the dose slightly. I'm going to increase the morning dose to 1000 milligrams. And the evening dose we can keep at 500. So we'll go met 4,000 milligrams in the morning and 500 milligrams in the evening. Please continue to check your blood sugars. Let me know what they are when you come back. You know, we just keep track of those. And then we'll see you back in four weeks. By the way, I want to have you follow up with me in four weeks. And for your third problem of asthma, let's continue you on the flow vent that seems to be doing pretty well continue to take that daily. And then also Albuterol is needed. So how does that sound for a plan? Any other questions, comments, suggestions.\n[patient]  That sounds good, and I also feel like I'm eating, been eating a lot of spicy food.\n[doctor]  Hmm.\n[patient]  Lately that could be contributing towards my gas strides. So I'm going to cut back on that as well.\n[doctor]  Okay, yeah, I'd also recommend while this is hurting you definitely cut back on the spices, the spicy food easier said than done sometimes I know, but yet the up or right sounds good. Well listen, I'll see you back in four weeks, give me a holler if you have any questions or anything else in the meantime.\n[patient]  I will.\n[doctor]  Alright you take care sure you got.",

            "src": "[doctor]  Good afternoon, Alexis. I understand you're having some issues with your hand.\n[patient]  Yes, I sit at the keyboard all day long and recently I've been having some numbness and tingling in my right hand.\n[doctor]  Okay, how long has that been going on?\n[patient]  I don't know probably on and off for six months, but over the last month or so it's been a little more persistent.\n[doctor]  Okay, okay. And when does that numbness and tingling do you get a lot of pain with it first? Let me ask that question.\n[patient]  Some pain.\n[doctor]  Some pain.\n[patient]  Mostly what I'm actually typing on the keyboard is when I experience the pain.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  But the numbness and tingling is all the time now.\n[doctor]  Okay, and when you get this pain, what makes it better is it's stopping and just resting for a while, or do you take medications or try other?\n[patient]  I've been taking ibuprofen, so ibuprofen and seem like not typing on the keyboard helps the most.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  The other thing that makes it hurt is my mouse.\n[doctor]  Your mouth okay.\n[patient]  Wow\n[doctor]  Yeah, when you're moving that around okay.\n[patient]  Yeah.\n[doctor]  Does this pain ever wake you up in the middle of the night? Or the pain or the tingling?\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  No, okay.\n[patient]  not affecting my sleep.\n[doctor]  Okay, so and you're using Motrin for for ibuprofen for the pain. Well, let me go ahead and take a take a look here at your Is it Both Hands or just your right hand?\n[patient]  Mostly my right hand.\n[doctor]  Mostly your right hand. Okay, so let's go ahead and take a look at that right hand when I bend your wrist does that cause any pain.\n[patient]  Yes.\n[doctor]  It does okay and so you do have some pain on extension and if you pull your hand wrist up towards you does that cause the pain also.\n[patient]  Yes.\n[doctor]  Yeah, okay, so you do have pain on flexion and extension and when I touch the fingertips here now you said you had some numbness in your thumb and your index finger and a little bit in your middle finger the other two fingers they feel okay or do you think that there is different than the other hand.\n[patient]  Yet for some reason it really is just that they thumb the pointer in the middle finger that I experience the most symptoms with.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  Not why that is.\n[doctor]  Okay, so I want you to grip my hands here and just squeeze tight, okay? So you do have a little bit of a less grip strength on the right, and that's typical that we would see with this type of pain. And an numbness that you have going on now, I want you to turn your arm over for me, and I'm going to touch on or tap on the inside of your wrist or or form. And when I do that, I can see your face or grimacing so that that must cause that shooting. Pain, yeah, okay. So you do have a positive tunnel sign. So in Alexis, what I think is going on is that you have a carpal tunnel syndrome, and we see that frequent.\n[patient]  I was afraid of.\n[doctor]  Yeah, you see this frequently, but people who are doing data entry spend a lot of time on keyboards, or you know, some a lot of manufacturing people who do a repetitive procedure again. And again, we'll get that type of pain. So here is my plan I'd like to put you in a splint, and it's it's kind of a wrist splint. I would like you to wear that at night that will help with that I want you to continue with the ibuprofins, but I would like you to go up to 600 milligrams four times a day and...\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  We're going to do that now I am going to order some AA outpatient test called an EMG, where we look at that nerve conduction study in that wrist. And that's really what's happening here is you've got some thickening into the in the wrist, and the the membranes of the wrist that are just pressing down, and just compressing some of those nerves, any other questions for me for now if that test comes back positive, and we'll talk about that later on here. Next, visit if it comes back positive, we may. Have to do, we're going to stick with conservative treatment first, but we may consider some surgery, where I can go in and release that impingement on your nerves through your wrist. It's a simple outpatient procedure, and then I think you would feel better. How does that sound?\n[patient]  That sounds like a good plan. I was hoping maybe I could get some relief with some therapy rather than having to go to surgery. So I like that plan very much.\n[doctor]  You will start with the the wrist splint, and once I get the nerve conduction studies that will give me another idea whether or not I need to send you some physical therapy in addition, or if we need to go directly to surgery, but that will all hinge on that nerve conduction test. Do you so? Do you have any further questions?\n[patient]  No, that's great. Thank you so much.\n[doctor]  Thank you very much.",

            "src": "[doctor]  Hey, good to see you, Philip. So I see here you're coming and you had some right elbow pain. Also, you have a past medical history of hypertension diabetes. We are going to check up on those as well. So can you tell me what happened to your elbow?\n[patient]  Sure, I heard it about a week ago, playing lacrosse with my kids, just suddenly started hurting me when I was throwing the ball.\n[doctor]  Okay, okay, so how old are your kids?\n[patient]  My oldest is 13 and the other one is 10. I was playing with a 13 year old.\n[doctor]  Okay, yeah, I know I play with my kids sometimes and I think I'm getting too old to do all that. So I just I've hurt myself before as well. Alright, so with your elbow, what part of your elbow would you say hurts?\n[patient]  It's really like right at the point of the elbow, right at right at the tip of it.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  and it just it hurt hurts anytime I move it.\n[doctor]  Anytime I move it, do you remember falling?\n[patient]  Now I don't think so, but my kid got pretty rough with me and was checking me several times with a sick.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  So I could have got hit there.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right, yeah, that, that, that definitely makes sense. So how would you describe the pain? Is it like a dull pain? Is it stabbing? What would you say?\n[patient]  It's a pretty sharp pain.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  Anytime I move.\n[doctor]  Okay, and does it radiate down your arm or does it stay in that one spot?\n[patient]  It radiates down the forearm.\n[doctor]  Radiates down the form. Alright, so have you taken any medications for it to make it better?\n[patient]  I tried taking aval couple of days, but I usually just forget about it.\n[doctor]  Okay, when you took a did it, did it help it all, did it change your pain score?\n[patient]  Yeah, I think it helps some.\n[doctor]  Okay, that's good alright, so we'll do a physical exam on that elbow. We'll take a look at it in a second. But I do want to talk to you about your hypertension you came in today. I know you have passed medical history of hypertension. Came in today, your blood pressures, a little bit high. It was a 150 over 7 over 90, which is pretty high today. I see you're on 20 of life, Sinopril. Have you been taking that daily?\n[patient]  Yes.\n[doctor]  Okay, so maybe you just have a little white coat syndrome. I know I have that myself. And even though I'm a physician, I still don't like to go to the doctor. So I definitely understand how about your diet. I know we talked a little bit about that before. And you said kind of during the pandemic, you fell off a little bit, how you've been doing that have you been lowering your salt intake.\n[patient]  Yeah, but I only eat low salt items avoid adding salt to food. Kind of the whole whole family follows like a Mediterranean diet.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  We try to be pretty good about it.\n[doctor]  Okay, yeah, that's good. That's definitely good. Yeah, I know a lot of people during the pandemic, it was, you know, sitting at home and then eating more than we should, but that's I'm very happy that you've been compliant and you have that low salt diet. So let's talk about your diabetes. I think you see here on 500 of Metformin, are you taking that as well, daily?\n[patient]  Yes.\n[doctor]  Okay, and your blood sugars, how have they been?\n[patient]  Since I don't take insulin, I don't check it every day. When I have checked it, it's usually running somewhere between 80 to 100.\n[doctor]  Okay, yeah, that's really good, yeah. So that's pretty good. So what we're gonna do, we're gonna get a 1C just to see you know that range and its possibility, we can we can you know lower that metform and dosage, but we will do that after your visit then we will take a look at that. So let me go ahead and we'll do that quick exam of your elbow. But first I want to make sure you're not having any chest pain or anything like that.\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  No belly pain.\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  All right, so listen to your lungs. So your lungs are clear, bilaterally listened to your heart. So your heart exam, you do still have that grade 2 out of 6 systolic ejection murmur, but we know it about that before. So let me take a look at your elbow. So when I press right here on the back of your elbow, is that painful.\n[patient]  Yes.\n[doctor]  Alright, so when I have you, you flex and extend it, it's painful does that does that hurt.\n[patient]  Yes, it does.\n[doctor]  Alright, so your right elbow exam shows you have pain to palpation of the electron on area of the posterior elbow. You do have mild pain with flexion and extension, but you do have also normal range of motion at that elbow. So we did do an x-ray before you came in and luckily nothing's broken. No fracture, no bony abnormality. So it's a normal x-ray, which is really good. So let me just talk to you a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so you have a elbow contusion. I believe your son did. Hit you with the lacrosse stick and it caused that pain. I see some swelling, little inflammation there. As well, you have a little bit of a bruise. I think that's what happens. So for that I know you're having some pain. I'm going to prescribe you 800 milligrams of ibuprofen. You can take that twice a day and that should help with some of that swelling. And pain, I also want you to ice it three times a day for 20 minutes at a time that should also help with the swelling and pain. And just for the time being for the next couple of weeks, just you know maybe you know not play lacrosse with your son just to help that heal then you can get back on the field.

Any other you know family members that that you remember that may have that problem?\n[patient]  Why don't really think? So I don't really talk to my parents too much.\n[doctor]  I know.\n[patient]  But I have a pretty good relationship with my grandparents.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  You know, and I remember talking to my grandmother and my grandfather both, and they don't they said that when they were young they didn't have anything like that. So I had mine checked last year and the doctor said it was a little borderline.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  But it wasn't anything to be worried about that time. It kind of just blew it off. Just told me to watch what I was eating. And now they say it's really hot. And I don't understand what's going on.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right, okay. Well, we'll we'll we'll take a look at that. Okay. Now tell me have you had any issues you know with growing growing up bones or feeling okay? You feel like you're growing okay.\n[patient]  I guess so I mean when I met with my doctor I they talked about making health goals and making sure that that I feel okay and I decided about two years ago that I don't feel much like a girl I said more just kind of non-gender and that's how I've been living\n[doctor]  Yeah\n[patient]  But I mean I thought I was healthy.\n[doctor]  Yeah, okay, well, you know, we can get you there too.

And he was only like 44-45.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  Did they think that he had a heart attack?\n[doctor]  Okay, well, I'm sorry to hear that okay. So that's that's helpful information though. Okay, let's go ahead and do physical exam on you there. Julie, I'm going to go ahead and take a look at your vital signs. Looks like your blood pressure looks good. So that's good. Now in your heart exam, I don't appreciate any murmur rubs or gallops on your lung exam. Your lungs are clear on your eye exam. I don't appreciate any zentomas and also on your neck exam. Here there is no thyroid megaly. So now on your abdominal exam, I don't appreciate any hepatomegaly or splenomegaly. Why can I see these today? So I reviewed the results of your cholesterol level and it was elevated at 2 10. So that's high. So let me go ahead and tell you about my plan. So for your problem of elevated cholesterol, what we want to do is you know the American Academy of Pediatrics actually recommends that all children be screen screened once you know they become between ages and 9 and 11 and then again between ages 17 and 20. So that's why you were screened. Okay, so we do we yes. So we do this because studies have shown a link between high cholesterol and premature heart attacks. So I want to go ahead and order full cholesterol panel. There could be other reasons that could be causing the high cholesterol. But I'll go ahead also and check some glucose a complete metabolic panel some thyroid studies and liver panels and I want to perform a genetic testing to see if this problem is familial or this is a secondary. So we're also going to go ahead. I want to follow up in a follow up with a well balanced diet. So including a variety of foods that are lower in saturated fat and sugars. So I want you to follow that and I want you to meet a nutritionist and so who can give you information about what kind of foods to eat? Okay.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  All right, now I do want you to continue to be active and exercise, so that's great especially that you know your bike riding, so you keep that up, that's a great thing, and you're doing well with that, so keep that up for you okay. And then I want to follow up with another cholesterol level in three to six months after you've met with a nutritionist, and then, and they've you know instituted those dietary changes.\n[patient]  Okay, it sounds good.\n[doctor]  Okay, good well take care, Julie, I'll talk to you soon.\n[patient]  Alright, thanks document.\n[doctor]  Thank you bye.",

How would you describe it?\n[patient]  I would say it's dull, it's kind of like a pressure.\n[doctor]  Okay, and does it go anywhere or radiate any place?\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  Okay, alright, but no chest pain right now, no shortness of breath, no sweats, or claminess, or anything like that right now.\n[patient]  Nothing right now.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right. Well, certainly you know I looked at your EKG that did we did in the office. When you came in the EKG, I don't see any signs of a heart attack or anything like that. So I mean, we should definitely talk about the plan for this chest pain in a few minutes. But right now the good news is I don't see any signs of a heart attack or anything like that. So let's talk a little bit about your other conditions since you are here today. How are you doing with your diabetes? I know we have you on that foreman. And we talked about last time about you know improving your diet and exercise. I'm glad you're exercising, but I'm so sorry to hear about the chest pain. So tell me about how is that going.\n[patient]  Yeah, I mean I think my blood sugars have been a little higher because I haven't been able to be active and I'm trying with the diet You know I do love sodas, so I'm really trying strengthos\n[doctor]  Yeah, I am addicted to diet coke myself. So I hear you on that one. And we had checked your hemoglobin, a 1C last time it was, you know, 7. Which is pretty good. It's not, you know, it could be better, but it's not, it's not bad. And we talked about sending you to ophthalmology also for an eye exam. Have you seen ophthalmology in the last few months or last before I saw you?\n[patient]  I had an appointment in two weeks, it was a long waiting.\n[doctor]  Okay, got it. And any nausea vomiting or diarrhea or anything like that with your diabetes or any side effects from your medications that met foreman.\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right, good. And I saw also there was a record in your, I was looking at your record before previously, before I walked and you also had, we've been checking your blood pressure. But, but I think you've been into several other clinicians and they had documented high blood pressure. Have you noticed any findings with that? Or have you know, have anybody talked about high blood pressure with you or mentioned that? Because we don't have it in our system here. Yet, but I did add it in today, but we don't. Have you on any medications yet for that?\n[patient]  No, I mean, I don't know. Doc, no one told me about high blood pressure. Do I have high blood pressure?\n[doctor]  Well, I think the last time you were in the clinic and one of the clinics said the referrals the blood pressure was elevated, so they had mentioned that I noticed a trend in your blood pressure. It's been running on a little bit on the high side. We haven't really diagnosed you with that yet, but I think we are something that we should definitely consider looking at your trend of your blood pressure readings over the last, you know, a few years.\n[patient]  Okay, do you think that could be causing me my chest pain?\n[doctor]  It certainly could be contributing to that. It certainly could be a factor that we need to look at so.\n[patient]  Someone had told me before.\n[doctor]  Yummy too, but we can definitely get you started on some monitoring devices for that. And also maybe start you on some diet control things that we can do to help with the blood pressure. And maybe start you on some blood pressure medications if we need to okay.\n[patient]  Okay sounds good.\n[doctor]  So let me examine you Elizabeth for a second for the because we're running out of time here for a second. So I'm going to go ahead and do my exam. We got taught just in my magical exam and I'm going to go ahead and verbalize some of my findings just so I can get it documented in my note. Okay. And I'll explain things as we go along. So there is no JVD. There is no swelling in your neck. There's no carotid roots. You're long exam is clear. I don't hear any crackles or a ronky or hard exam. You do have a two over six. It's a stalacic ejection murmur. You had that in the past. Otherwise, it's regular rate and rhythm. Your pulses are equal. Your belly exam is nice and soft. You're no tenderness. No guarding. No masses that I can feel on your belly and your back exam is fine. Your extremity exam. You have a little bit of swelling in your lower legs. One plus non-pitting edema or swelling in the in your ankle area. Here, no calf tenderness. So what does all this mean? I'll explain that in a second. So basically your exam is pretty normal except for you have a little bit of swelling in your legs. So you know what this chest pain, I'm a little bit. So the first diagnosis that we talk about is this chest pain I'm worried about my suspicion is you have something called unstable in China, especially considering your history of diabetes and the suspected history of high blood pressure and your family history of heart disease in the past as well. I'm going to go ahead and refer you to cardiology. I reviewed your EKG today. So that looks normal. So that's good. No other signs of a heart attack. But I am worried that you may have some sort of a blockage going on that's causing this chest pain. I'm going to go ahead and start you on some aspirin daily. I'm also going to give you a prescription just a baby aspirin. You can take 81 milligrams once a day. And also I'm going to give you a prescription for nitroglycerin. It's a little pill you split underneath your tongue. You have this chest pain if it doesn't go away. After one or two pills, I want you to go to the hospital call. 9-1-1 and go to the hospital. But we will try to get you into cardiology the next week and get you set up for some sort of a stress test to look at your heart. Okay, any questions about that?\n[patient]  So anytime I have a chest pain, even if I'm just like walking I have to take that pill.\n[doctor]  Yeah, if you stop walking the chest pain goes away, you don't have to take the pill, but if you are walking or you stop and the chest pain does not go away, I would take the pill and see if it goes away if it is not.\n[patient]  How long do I wait to see if it goes away?\n[doctor]  about five minutes so you can take it up to three pills every five minutes. And if it doesn't go away then I would you know go to the hospital and get this checked out because I worry about with this chest pain that you're having making sure it doesn't lead to a heart attack. Those chest pain could be a you know AA sign that you may be having some less blood flow to your heart and we need to get that checked out pretty quickly.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Alright.\n[patient]  MM\n[doctor]  And for the second problem, the diabetes, you know, I think you're doing fairly well, continue with your eye-off-themology appointment you have for your eye exam for the diabetic retinopathy. Continue the metformin 500 milligrams twice a day. I'm going to order another hemoglobin A1c today. And I'm going to have you come back in about two weeks and we can see if we need to make any adjustments continue to try to stay away. From you know that the pop and the sweet things and once we have your heart, take in care of or make sure your heart is okay, you can and we can hopefully resolve this chest pain that you're having get back to your exercise regimen. Okay, any questions about that?\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  Okay, and for the third diagnosis, the high blood pressure, you do have a trend I've noticed in your chart that your blood pressure has been running a little bit high, several other people have documented. As well, I'm going to go ahead and start you on some hydrochlorothiazide. It's a pretty low dose medication to help you with your blood pressure plus. It'll also help with you some of the swelling you have in your feet. I'm going to have you use a blood pressure cuff at home and enter your findings at Epic MyCard. And I'll get a reading of those as well. And then what when you come back in two weeks will keep a log of your blood pressure daily in the morning when you wake up and see how things are going. And then if we need to make any adjustments to the medications we can but especially considering your history and the chest pain and the diabetes and the swelling, I think starting this hydrochlorothiazide is probably a good idea.\n[patient]  Okay, are there any side effects with this medication?\n[doctor]  Yeah, it can cause, sometimes it can cause a little bit of make you go to the bathroom, a little bit more often in the evening. But generally, most people don't have a whole lot of side effects. I'll give you a hand out of the side effects. But sometimes you can have a cross-reaction with some other medications like sulfamedications. But generally, most people tolerate this pretty well.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  All right, any other questions we got?\n[patient]  That's it.\n[doctor]  Alright well great seeing you thanks for coming in today.\n[patient]  Thank you appreciate it.",

Chest pain.\n- Medical Reasoning: Considering her history of diabetes, possible history of hypertension, and family history of heart disease, I suspect her chest pain is likely unstable angina. Her recent EKG was unremarkable and there are no other signs of heart attack, but I am worried she may have some sort of a blockage causing her pain.\n- Patient Education and Counseling: We discussed proper protocol for sublingual nitroglycerin for chest pain. I advised her to go to the emergency department if the medication is not effective after approximately 5 minutes.\n- Medical Treatment: We will have her start a regimen of baby aspirin at 81 mg daily, for which I have sent in a prescription today. I also sent a prescription for nitroglycerin up to 3 tablets every 5 minutes as needed. Finally, I am going to have her follow up with cardiology for further evaluation.\n\n2.

This should help us determine if any adjustments need to be made to her new medications. We discussed the possible side effects of hydrochlorothiazide how this will hopefully reduce some of her swelling seen on physical exam. All of her questions were answered.\n- Medical Treatment: I'm going to have her start hydrochlorothiazide at a low dose.\n\nPatient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nThe patient will follow up in 2 weeks.",

            "src": "[doctor]  Hey, Sophia, how are you doing today?\n[patient]  I've been better my primary care, Dr. Wantamita C.U. because of this knee pain that I've been having for about six months now.\n[doctor]  Okay, do you remember what caused the pain initially?\n[patient]  You know, I really can't recall any specific event that caused the pain.\n[doctor]  Alright, well, can you describe the pain for me?\n[patient]  Yeah, so it's like a deep, achy pain that I feel like it's behind my kneecaps. And sometimes I can even hear what seems like some creaking in my knees.\n[doctor]  All right, now tell me what type of activities makes that pain worse.\n[patient]  So I feel like the pain gets worse anytime. I'm like getting from like a seated position to standing. So I work from home. Some of my desk a lot. So anytime I get up I have some pain or after watching TV or even like going up and downstairs it's really painful.\n[doctor]  Okay, and does anything make the pain feel better?\n[patient]  Usually after I rest it for some time, it does help with the pain.\n[doctor]  Okay, now you did mention earlier that you have tried some things in the past can you tell me what they were.\n[patient]  Yes, when it first started hurting, I was putting ice on it. And I even got like some ace bandage like wrapping from the pharmacy. I do take ibuprofen or a leaf sometimes, but I try to avoid really taking any medications.\n[doctor]  Okay, and tell me what is your day like?\n[patient]  Well, I try to be as active as I can I actually love to run and I would run like five to six miles a day, but now I mean honestly, I can't even get a half a mile and my leg will start hurting my knee will start hurting.\n[doctor]  Okay, that's definitely a decrease in your mileage. There were have you been running lately like do you run outside or on a treadmill or?\n[patient]  Yeah, I know I will do the treadmill during the winter, but I just love being outdoors and running.\n[doctor]  Yeah, yeah, there are some really nice senior routes here in Boston, isn't there like?\n[patient]  There are.\n[doctor]  So many new places there's some right by the harbor that I've done some runs there before too. It's pretty nice. Well, I mean the Boston Marathon. What can you say, right?\n[patient]  Right, exactly, exactly know it's very nice.\n[doctor]  Well, okay, well, hopefully that we get you feeling better, so you can start running again more then. Five miles, but tell me though, have you noticed any swelling or redness in your knees?\n[patient]  No, not really.\n[doctor]  Okay, and have you ever injured your knees before?\n[patient]  No, I've been pretty good. I actually have never broken a bone. Actually, no, I'm going to change that. Actually, I did break my arm when I was in sixth grade, but nothing since then.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  Bye.\n[doctor]  Okay, and it's just your arm, right not not your knee.\n[patient]  Right?\n[doctor]  Okay, well, all right. Well, let's go ahead and do a quick physical exam on you. Here, let me look at your vital signs. Okay. I reviewed your vitals. They, they overall, they look good. Take a listen to your heart real quick. All right. And your heart exam. I hear regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs. And on your musculoskeletal exam, I have seen you and walk around here. And you do have normal gate. All right. Now I'm going to have you do some movements on your legs here. Okay.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  All right, good your strength is three out of five for abduction of legs bilaterally, and the remainder of muscle strength for your lower extremities are five out of five. So that's good. Let me take a look at your knee now on your knee exam. There is no overlying erythema that's redness or echinosis, and that's bruising or any warmth of the skin appreciated. There is no effusion. Let me go ahead and feel around here. Does that hurt right here? How does that feel?\n[patient]  It does.\n[doctor]  Sorry, so there is tenderness to palpation of the bilateral redinacular redinaculum, and there is positive patellar grine test all right. And can you are you able to squat for me?\n[patient]  I can but that hurts.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right. So you're definitely having some knee pain with squatting, and I'm just going to maneuver your leg just a little bit here real quick. Okay. So lock my anterior and posterior drawer and McMurray tests are all negative bilaterally. So that's good there. Okay. Now your neuroexamptella and Achilles reflexes are symmetrical. All right. So now I did review the results of your x-ray and both of your knees, which shows no fractures or osteoarthritis. So let me go ahead and tell you about my assessment and plan. So for your problem of bilateral knee pain based on what you told me your exam and reviewing your MRI, your symptoms are consistent with patella femoral pain syndrome. And this is a very common condition that we see that causes knee pain especially in active young people. So this condition has to do with the way your knee cap, which is your patella, how that moves along the groove of your thigh or thigh bone, which is the femur now for the pain you may continue taking ibuprofen or anti-inflammatory as needed to help with the pain. But I'm also going to recommend physical therapy where where they will show you a number of lower extremity exercises. And this will help increase your lower extremities, strength, your mobility and correct any incorrect running mechanics that you may have. So do you have any questions for me about that?\n[patient]  while I'll be able to run anytime soon.\n[doctor]  Well, that is a goal of treatment and to get you back and running again, now you will have to take and take it easy from running for now, but we will continue to assess your progress with each visit okay.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Alright, anything else.\n[patient]  No, I think that's it.\n[doctor]  Okay, well very good while I will be following up with you soon, and again just take it easy for now from the running okay.\n[patient]  Okay, thank you.\n[doctor]  Bye.\n[patient]  Bye.",

Payne, could you tell me like how you've been doing what's going on?\n[patient]  Yeah, I have this real bad low back pain. It started a couple of weeks ago. I was lifting something and I just felt a pop and I don't know what's going on.\n[doctor]  Okay, and so you were like moving. What were you moving exactly when you say lifting?\n[patient]  I was lifting a box of books.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  Yeah.\n[doctor]  Alright, did we use proper lifting technique?

And how is positioning for you does any sitting in any particular position hurt more or hurt less?\n[patient]  No sitting is usually okay for me.\n[doctor]  Don't I'm okay?

Either I'm working through some things in my head to make sure that I give you the best care that we need right on making a plan, as we move along you mentioned that the pain has been getting worse have you done anything or tried anything that's worked in the past.\n[patient]  I try to take some ibuprofen and Tylenol.\n[doctor]  Hmm.\n[patient]  But that sometimes helps.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right, and has anyone discuss the option of like, just no has anyone discuss surgery with you?\n[patient]  No, this is the first time I'm talking about it.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right, that's good. So what is your like, how what is your activity level right now that I know that you know in a lintic weightlifter with books, what else do you do to like exercise?\n[patient]  You know, I try to exercise a few times a week, but I'm pretty inconsistent. I have a sedentary job.\n[doctor]  Okay, alright, and has this like pain started to like affect you like in your job or anything like that?\n[patient]  Not my job, but I feel like I don't want to be as active as I was previously.\n[doctor]  Alright, so do you have any family members that have spine conditions?\n[patient]  Yeah, my dad is back pain.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right, and then do you smoke?\n[patient]  I don't smoke.\n[doctor]  Okay, awesome alright. So sorry one question did you have a history of playing sports?\n[patient]  Yes.\n[doctor]  Okay, what did you play?\n[patient]  soccer\n[doctor]  Okay, what position?\n[patient]  I played midfield.\n[doctor]  Okay, the people who hide in the back that's fine, I was centered forward, fine, no baby. Do you have a team that you wrote for?\n[patient]  You know I'm a Tatinum Hotspur fan.\n[doctor]  They have the best colors not going to lie, but I grew up Monu so sorry.\n[patient]  Well, I won't fault you for that.\n[doctor]  Thanks, okay. So if you don't mind, I'm gonna go ahead and do my physical exam. I'm gonna call out my findings just to have them recorded. And if you have any questions, please feel free to stop me and let me know, okay?\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Alright, so looking at your vitals, your blood pressure, seems alright, we are in like the 130 over 70 range that's perfectly fine your respiratory rate. I have you at an 18 again, pretty normal. When I listen here to your heart, you have a regular rate. And rhythm, I don't appreciate any murmurs, rubs, or gallops that means your heart sounds great on your respiratory exam, your lung sound, clear to osculation bilaterally on your. Musculoskeletal back exam, as I'm looking here, I don't. Notice any overlying redness or bruising on the skin when I push here on the midline of your back, does it hurt?\n[patient]  Yes.\n[doctor]  Okay, so there is midline tenderness at the L4 L5 disc space with right-sided lumbar pair of vertebral tenderness. Alright, so are you able to bend forward?\n[patient]  Yes.\n[doctor]  Alright, and are you able to bend backward?\n[patient]  Yes.\n[doctor]  Alright, do either of those actions cause you pain.\n[patient]  bending forward\n[doctor]  Okay, so pain with lumbar flexion and so I'm going to have you lie down and we're going to do I'm sorry, okay, and then I see that a supine straight like test is positive. All right, so for your neurological exam you said that you are experiencing pain radiating down, radiating down your left leg correct.\n[patient]  Yes.\n[doctor]  All right, when I touch, are there any like decreased sensation?\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right, so patella and Achilles reflexes are symmetrical, all right. So I received before you came in here, we got an MRI. And so in reviewing your results, it does show a disc desiccation, a disc bulge with paracentral disc herniation resulting in moderate right neuro-feraminal. I don't like this word neuro-feraminal stenosis. What those complicated words is that I just said is that it seems that you have AA, herniated disc with nerve impingement. So let's talk about my assessment and plan all right. Your symptoms are in line with I'm sorry you have lumbar back pain at the L4 L5 disc space due to a herniated disc with ridiculous apathy. This means that one of your discs that sits between your vertebrae like the bones in your spine is bulging out and the bulge is pinching on some nerves. So that's why you're feeling that pain like radiating down your leg. I'm going to recommend something a spinal injection with a strong end said and called the I'm sorry and a corticosteroid. I'm just going to inject it into the lumbar spine under fluoroscopy, which you can think of like an x-ray to localize the exact area of your pain. This should help with the inflammation that's causing your pain. I know that sounds a bit scary at this is a typical procedure that I do all the time. It's an office and we can get you scheduled today if you would like. So what questions do you have right now?\n[patient]  Is that something that we can do today?\n[doctor]  Yeah, I think I have time in my schedule to get a done today, just you know I'm here for you right now.\n[patient]  All right.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  Are there any complications with this?\n[doctor]  There are, sorry, yeah, you're right, there are risks associated with this kind of injection, just like any procedure, but we aim to minimize them. And my mom, when she comes in, we will give you some paperwork with explanations and any and hopefully answer most of the questions that you have. If after reading that you have any more questions, please feel free to stop us.

            "src": "[doctor]  Angela, good to see you today. So I'm writing here in my notes that you're coming and you had some left knee pain. So how did you hurt your knee?\n[patient]  Yeah, so I hurt my knee the other day when I was running around with my niece. She is learning how to take off the training wheels for her bike.\n[doctor]  Hmm.\n[patient]  And I fell and I think I twisted my knee in some kind of funky way.\n[doctor]  Okay, that's not good how old are your knees.\n[patient]  She's 5 and perfect.\n[doctor]  Well, that's good that you're trying to help her with the learning how to ride a bike.\n[patient]  Yeah.\n[doctor]  That sounds fun, but I'm sad as you hurt your knee doing it. So for your knee pain, are you able to bear weight on that leg the left leg?\n[patient]  While I've been limping ever since, and it really hasn't gotten better, so I thought it was maybe time to come see you because it happened about a week ago.\n[doctor]  Yeah, yeah, it's definitely a good time to come see me, so what part of your knee would you say it hurts?\n[patient]  Honestly, it's been hurting on both sides more so on the inside than the outside.\n[doctor]  So, okay, so more in the medial aspect, less on the lateral, okay, that makes sense. And you said did you hear a pop when you when you twisted it?\n[patient]  Yeah, I did.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right, so how would you rate your pain with your knee out of out of one to ten?\n[patient]  It started off as like a four, but I think it's getting worse and it's starting like it's like a throbbing kind of pain, yeah.\n[doctor]  Alright, and have you taken anything for the pain?\n[patient]  Yeah, so I like a ulcer not too long ago. So my doctor told me that I couldn't take any like kind of adveau or ibuprofen.\n[doctor]  Hmm.\n[patient]  So I've been taking some Tylenol and I wrapped it with Kinneziology tape. Are you familiar with that?\n[doctor]  Yep, yeah, I'm familiar.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Alright, and has the Has the IBi Profin been helping you at all?\n[patient]  I can't take ibuprofen.\n[doctor]  I mean I'm sorry the Tylenol.\n[patient]  No, it's okay, but the Tylenol helps like a little bit, but you know, like it's like a time limit right, so by the time, and I'm not supposed to take it like more than like every like four hours or something like that, but by hour two, like it hurts again.\n[doctor]  Okay, yet that yeah, you can't take too much of that Tylenol because it'll mess up your liver definitely.\n[patient]  Right?\n[doctor]  Alright, so go ahead and do a quick exam on your knee here. So when I press here, does that hurt?\n[patient]  You like when you press on the inside that hurts a lot?\n[doctor]  Okay, all right, I'm going to do a couple of other maneuvers here for your knee. So on your left knee exam, I do appreciate some edema. You also have some effusion, some fluid in the knee. You have moderate range of motion. So you're able to move it a little bit, but not all the way. I also see you have some pain on flexion and extension of the knee, even negative lockments test and a negative valgus and baris test as well. So all that to say is I don't think anything is as torn in your knee based on the your physical exam. So we did do a x-ray of your left knee and luckily it was normal. So there is no fractures, no bony abnormalities. So everything is good there. So let me talk to you a little bit about my assessment and plan for your knee okay.\n[patient]  Yeah.\n[doctor]  All right, so for your left knee pain, I believe you have an MCL strain or a medial collateral ligament that's the inside of your knee, I think when you were running with your knee, she had somehow twisted it. And so you strain that ligament there. So for that, what I want to do, I'm going to give you some pain medication that's not an N-side. So I will put you on some tram at all. You can take 50 milligrams. You can do that twice a day. And then you can take that Tylenol as needed for breakthrough. Pain all right. I'm going to put you in a knee immobilizer, leg knee immobilizer. And you can wear that for the next week. I just want to keep the knee for moving so it can heal a little bit and reduce some of the inflammation that you're seeing here. And I also want you to ice it. And you can do that three or four times a day for 20, 30 minutes at a time. And that should help some of that swelling as well. And I know I know your niece is going to be upset, but I just don't want you to be running. Probably for the next three weeks, with her just to help us get time to let allow the knee to heal. So how does that sound?\n[patient]  That's alright, how long do you think it'll be before I can run or something like that?\n[doctor]  Hmm, I think you'll be back to normal in about a month, the strain doesn't seem too bad, but we just need to get you off of the knee, so we can allow it to heal. I mean, once we do that, you know along with you know the icing, the mobilization, and you're taking the medication, I think you'll be good to go in a month. If you do feel like you're getting a little bit worse, please feel free to call the office, and we can get you in and possibly do more imaging such as an MRI to you notice see if it's anything. Worst, but I don't think it is, but just let us know how you feel in a couple of days.\n[patient]  Okay, all right, thanks.\n[doctor]  All right, any other questions?\n[patient]  No, that's it.\n[doctor]  Alright, great thanks!",
            "tgt": "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nAngela Powell is a pleasant 81-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of left knee pain. The onset of her pain began 1 week ago, when she was running around with her niece and fell. At the time of the injury, she heard a pop and believes that she twisted her knee. She reports that she has been limping since the injury. The patient locates her pain to the medial and lateral aspects of her knee. She rates her pain level as a 4 out of 10, however this is increasing. Her pain is described as a throbbing pain. The patient has been taking Tylenol, which has provided mild and temporary relief, as well as wrapping her knee with kinesiology tape. She states that she is unable to take ibuprofen secondary to an ulcer.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nMSK: Examination of the left knee: Edema and effusion noted. Moderate ROM. Pain with flexion and extension of the knee. Negative Lachman's. Negative valgus and varus stress test.\n\nRESULTS\n\n4 views of the left knee were taken. These reveal no evidence of any fractures or dislocations. No other abnormalities are noted.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nLeft knee pain, possible MCL strain.\n\nPLAN\n\nAfter reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have discussed with the patient that her x-rays did not reveal any signs of a tear. I have recommended that we treat the patient conservatively. The plan is to place the patient in a knee immobilizer to provide increased support for the next week. I have also prescribed the patient tramadol 50 mg to treat her pain. She can take Tylenol as needed for breakthrough pain. I have also advised her to ice her left knee 3 to 4 times a day for 20 to 30 minutes at a time. I have advised her to refrain from running for the next 3 weeks. If her pain does not improve with the immobilizer, I will recommend obtaining an MRI.\n",
