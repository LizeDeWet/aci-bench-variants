How have you been doing?\n[patient]  Same I guess. Pretty good.\n[doctor]  Okay, so you got my letter last time on the results. Your sugars are not very well controlled.\n[patient]  Yeah, I got them.\n[doctor]  Okay, so did you increase your glimpy ride?\n[patient]  Did I increase it?\n[doctor]  Yeah.\n[patient]  I'm still taking the 2 milligrams.\n[doctor]  Yeah, so we want you to, as the letter said, from the last time, when your A1c was 9.9, we wanted you to increase it to 4 milligrams twice a day, so let's start that.\n[patient]  Okay, sure. So you want me to take two of the pills now twice a day?\n[doctor]  Yes. Uh, how much of it do you have?\n[patient]  Why just filled it?\n[doctor]  Okay, good. So yeah, you can take two of them twice a day of what you have. The new prescription will be for 4 milligrams twice a day.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Great. And are you trying to eat healthier? Less sugars, less carbohydrates?\n[patient]  Oh well.\n[doctor]  Not really?\n[patient]  Well, I haven't had any pasta. I just don't really like it, so we don't have any in the house. We don't often have bread, and if we do, we buy wheat bread.\n[doctor]  Okay, but even the wheat bread, try to cut down on the number of slices you eat per day.\n[patient]  I just usually have two in the morning. I don't care for sandwiches much. Maybe peanut butter sandwiches once in a while.\n[doctor]  Yeah.\n[patient]  a hardly drink, drink any sodas.\n[doctor]  Well, that's great.\n[patient]  I drink club soda.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  Seltzer water. That's what I prefer. So that's my water. I don't drink regular water.\n[doctor]  Okay, that's fine. How about your eye exams? Are they up to date?\n[patient]  Yep, I've just got new glasses.\n[doctor]  Okay. Who do you go see?\n[patient]  I go to Liberty Road, the group up there.\n[doctor]  Okay, the optimum optometrist, right?\n[patient]  They keep changing doctors each time I go.\n[doctor]  A new dock each time?\n[patient]  Yeah, I got a really nice one I used to see a year ago.\n[doctor]  Was that Dr. Sanchez?\n[patient]  Yeah.\n[doctor]  Okay, and you saw him not too long ago?\n[patient]  Yeah, I just got my prescription from him. Well, see, I had the iodine for my eyes.\n[doctor]  Cataracts, yep, okay.\n[patient]  So he did that and then I had to wait for a month to get healed up and then he wrote my prescription.\n[doctor]  Perfect. And then you've got the high blood pressure.\n[patient]  Yeah, a couple of weeks ago, it was 116 on the dot.\n[doctor]  Okay, well, we will recheck it. You're on a combination of medications. You are on the Met Met, Metaprolol, 50 milligrams once a day. You're on the Lycinaprol with hydrochlorothiazide at 20, with 25 milligrams once a day, and you're on the M-Loadipine, 10 milligrams once a day. Are you taking all of those?\n[patient]  Well, yeah.\n[doctor]  Perfect. And then you've got the high cholesterol and the vascular disease in your legs. You're on Adder Vastatin. Are you tolerating it okay?\n[patient]  Yeah, but honestly my feet feel like hell.\n[doctor]  Yeah.\n[patient]  All the time, my legs are bugging me. I can't do much walking.\n[doctor]  Okay. Yeah, the feed I think is what we call peripheral neuropathy.\n[patient]  Also, I have the paint up to my hip.\n[doctor]  Okay, you have pain in the hips and upper legs?\n[patient]  Yeah, all of it.\n[doctor]  Okay, so those do seem relatively stable, right? And are you trying to get the walking in?\n[patient]  Yeah.\n[doctor]  Okay. And you're smoking still?\n[patient]  Yeah, still smoking.\n[doctor]  not ready to quit\n[patient]  No, not really.\n[doctor]  It's a bad combination.\n[patient]  I know. I'll think about it.\n[doctor]  Okay, now let's do my review of systems. You're not having any headaches or dizziness.\n[patient]  headaches or dizziness, no.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  Nothing, feeling totally normal.\n[doctor]  Good, good. And the vision is better with the cataract surgery? That's been good.\n[patient]  Yeah, not happy with this lens. It's kind of funny. The other one is good.\n[doctor]  Hmm, sometimes they can go in and clean up the eye with laser, but we'll see what they say.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Okay, no shortness of breath or coughing.\n[patient]  I've been coughing here lately because I've been congested.\n[doctor]  What does it look like when it comes up?\n[patient]  It's relatively clear.\n[doctor]  No fever, chills, no shortness of breath?\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  Okay. No chest pains or pressure or tightness.\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  nausea, vomiting, GI symptoms?\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  Okay. Ping okay?\n[patient]  Not good. It's, you know, I'm old. It takes me a little more time.\n[doctor]  slower stream but stable.\n[patient]  Yes, but I do pee.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  Several times per day.\n[doctor]  Hmm. How many times do you have to get up at night?\n[patient]  Not too bad, just once in a while.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  Then I have to pee by morning. I do tend to drink my drinks in the evening.\n[doctor]  Okay. Alright, let's have a look at you.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Physical exam. Carotids are normal. Pulse is no bits. Heart exam. Rhythm is regular, normal rate. S1 and S2 are crisp. I do not hear any murmurs today, okay. Have you leaned forward for me? Take some deep breaths in and out. Okay, lungs are clear. I don't hear any rasps or wheezing today.\n[patient]  My coffin got better this morning.\n[doctor]  You cleared out the lungs? Alright, let me take a look at your feet.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Okay. Extremities are without edema. Pulses are palpable on the Dorsalus-Petus posterior tibial. She has thicken nails.\n[patient]  Yeah.\n[doctor]  Yeah, mildly dry skin. No skin breakdown. Oh, let me know if you can feel this.\n[patient]  Okay, I close my eyes. Yeah, yeah, okay.\n[doctor]  mildly decrease sensation in the tips of the first and second toes. Okay, we're done with your exam.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Okay, so again, try to keep the feet moisturized.\n[patient]  Yeah.\n[doctor]  You do have a little bit of peryphi peripheral neuropathy. There is a medication we can use if they get really bad, but you're already on so many medications.\n[patient]  My girl that I talk to and stuff, she uses on her feet. She really likes it. It's like a foot scrub or some type of cream. I put it on when I think of it after the shower, so I could get my own instead.\n[doctor]  That sounds good. So for now, your sugars, we're going to check your, we're going to recheck your blood work today, but the sugars last time we checked, the A1c, your blood sugar average was above 9. I really want you to increase the glimpy ride. So the ones you have at home, the 2 milligram, take two of them twice a day.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Okay, watch for low sugars, weak, shaky, sweaty. If that happens, let us know, and I don't expect it to.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Okay, the new prescription that I'm going to write is going to be for the for milligram pill. So when you get the new one, just one pill twice a day. Also, continue the metformin, okay? Blood pressure. When I rechecked it, I got 140 over 60s. So the numbers at home are better. So we're going to continue the combination of medications. We'll check kidney function today.\n[doctor]  For your cholesterol though, you're on the high dose of adervastatin or lipitor to protect the arteries, so we really want to keep you on that.\n[patient]  Yeah, no problem.\n[doctor]  I want you to quit smoking, but we've had this battle before.\n[patient]  Yeah.\n[doctor]  Hmm, and then we will leave everything else the same. We'll get the labs today and we'll see you back here in four months. Sound good?\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Great. Have a good day, ma'am. Take care of yourself.\n[patient]  Thank you. You too.\n[doctor]  Bye!",

She denies increasing glimepiride to 4 mg twice a day as advised but confirms she is compliant with 2 mg twice a day. She mostly denies reducing sugar and carbohydrate intake, although she opts for wheat bread, she does not have pasta at home, and she does not drink much soda and instead drinks club soda or seltzer water. She reports that her diabetic eye exams are up to date and she follows with Dr. Sanchez at Optimum Optometrists. She recently underwent cataract surgery and received a new prescription for her glasses, noting improvement in her vision to one eye and displeasure with the lens in her other eye.\n\nShe confirms compliancy with her blood pressure medications of metoprolol 50 mg daily, lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide 20/25 mg daily, and amlodipine 10 mg daily. The patient intermittently completes at home blood pressure checks and reported seeing a systolic BP of 116 a few weeks ago. She is also compliant with her atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia and reports tolerating it well.\n\nThe patient is still experiencing bilateral hip, thigh, and foot pain related to peripheral neuropathy, noting her mobility is limited but she is walking as tolerated.\n\nMs. Martin does continue to smoke cigarettes and denies interest in cessation, although she agreed to begin thinking about it.\n\nShe is currently experiencing a productive cough with clear sputum that she attributes to her recent congestion.\n\nThe patient is also experiencing a slower urine stream, but it appears stable, and she contributes her urinary symptoms to aging. She also has nocturia on occasion which she contributes to her increased fluid intake in the evenings.\n\nPAST HISTORY\n\nMedical\nType 2 diabetes mellitus.\nHypertension.\nHyperlipidemia.\nPeripheral vascular disease with neuropathy.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nCurrent tobacco smoker.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS\n\nMetoprolol 50 mg tablet.

I counselled patient on the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia, although I don\u2019t think she is at a great risk of hypoglycemia. There will be no change to her metformin dose. I counselled the patient on limiting her carbohydrate intake to support improved glycemia. We will recheck her Hemoglobin A1c and complete a kidney function test today.\n\nPeripheral vascular disease\nI counselled patient on improving frequency of moisturizing her feet. Improved glycemia would also benefit her neuropathy. If symptoms worsen, we will consider medication to control symptoms, but not at this time due to the patient has already reached polypharmacy.\n\nHypertension\nBlood pressure appears to be well controlled based on checks completed at home.

Patient is a 60-year-old, right-handed male, referred today for evaluation of numbness and tingling.\n[doctor]  Hello, Mr. Cook. How are you doing this morning?\n[patient]  Hi, Dr. Martinez. This weekend was a bit rough. I've had this numbness and tingling for a few weeks now.\n[doctor]  So it's in both of your hands.\n[patient]  Yes, ever since my car wreck last December when I broke them. Well, once they healed, I mean I noticed it more, the tingling and the numbness.\n[doctor]  And you still wear the splint only on the right wrist?\n[patient]  No, I also wear the left sometimes. The ride is just worse, but the splint helps. Both have really gotten worse over the last month. When I broke them, my right wrist was definitely in worse shape. I've also been having some S-mild stiffness in my neck too. I hit my head during the accident and they told me it was a contusion.\n[doctor]  And where would you say the tingling and numbness is?\n[patient]  On this side, it goes from here and here up to about here. On the other side, it's from here to here.\n[doctor]  I see. So on the right side you're pointing from the middle and ring finger all the way up the form. And on the left the symptoms extend from the pinky and ring finger. And is there any pain or just tingling and numbness?\n[patient]  Eh, it's mainly just sore. Sometimes they throb, but overall, they feel weak or too, especially when I'm using them. The tingling happens more when they hurt, but when it goes away, the tingling is dull.\n[doctor]  And when do you feel these symptoms?\n[patient]  Well, really I guess, just more so at night, and they come and go throughout the day.\n[doctor]  Okay, and do you experience any loss of sensation in your hands or fingers?\n[patient]  Like feeling something? No, not that I can really think of. Though, in general, they may be less sensitive than they should be, but I can still feel. They also gave me some nerve pain medicine, but I haven't been taking it like I should.\n[doctor]  And are you still on the car egg for hypertension and the lexapro for anxiety?\n[patient]  Yes, I'm still taking those. I had pre-diabetes too, but I got it under control by changing my diet.\n[doctor]  And no history of thyroid issues, correct?\n[patient]  Nope.\n[doctor]  Alright, thank you, Mr. Cook. Okay, first we'll go over your review of systems. Correct me if I'm wrong in any of this.\n[doctor]  Constitutional, you have fatigue and weight gain, GI, you have excessive appetite and bloating, eyes have floaters, cardiovascular shows shortness of breath and leg swelling, endocrine, you're always hungry, skin, you have some nail bed changes, dryness, itching, musculoskeletal, you have gout and muscle pain, and the remainder of the review of systems is negative.\n[patient]  Yep, that's all correct.\n[doctor]  All right, we're going to go ahead and do the neurologic examination. Let's look at the right hand first. Can you feel this?\n[patient]  Yeah, but a little less on these two fingers.\n[doctor]  Sensation is normal, except pin prick sensation diminished in third and fourth fingers on the right.\n[doctor]  and how about on the left?\n[patient]  Um, yeah, but these two a little less.\n[doctor]  Sensation is decreased in the fourth and fifth fingers on the left.\n[doctor]  Okay, let's test your reflexes now. Reflexes are 1 plus and symmetric, 2 plus knees. Toes are down going bilaterally.\n[doctor]  Alright, I'm going to tap on your right wrist. Do you feel anything?\n[patient]  Yeah, it feels like a zing at my wrist and something into my elbow too.\n[doctor]  and how about the left side?\n[patient]  Yeah, same on that side too.\n[doctor]  to null-sign positive at both wrists and both elbows. Rest of exam is normal.\n[doctor]  Alright, so what I am seeing today is bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome or potentially this could also be bilateral cubital tunnel syndrome. However, your symptom presentation suggests car bilateral carpal syndrome as the nerve in your wrists are aggravated by your past trauma. This is causing the pain and tingling you were describing to me.\n[patient]  Okay, so how do we make it better?\n[doctor]  First, I want to determine exactly where the nerve irritation is coming from. We'll need to schedule you for a nerve test, which is called an EMG test. They will measure the responsiveness of your nerves to truly pinpoint where you're having your issues.\n[patient]  That sounds fine to me.\n[doctor]  Great! After the tests are complete, you can return here for follow-up visit. If you're still having symptoms, we can consider a referral to our hand clinic, possibly for injections or carpal tunnel release essay surgery. You could also refer. We could also refer you to an orthopedist for the same treatment.\n[patient]  Sound good doc.\n[doctor]  Alright, keep wearing your splints and I will see you after those studies.\n[patient]  Thank you.",

All right, any difficulty with swallowing? Feels like food or liquids kind of get stuck.\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  Okay, that's good. Any abdominal pain?\n[patient]  No, not really.\n[doctor]  nausea or vomiting, changes in bowel movements.\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  constipation, diarrhea, rectal bleeding.\n[patient]  Nope.\n[doctor]  Okay, very good. And how long have you had this problem?\n[patient]  I've had acid reflux since I was around 12, but it has gotten worse over the past few years.\n[doctor]  Okay. And how long have you been on the Omeppersol?\n[patient]  On the way, it is now I think about a year.\n[doctor]  Okay. Do you find that it's done anything for you in the past?\n[patient]  I mean, I could tell it's help because some days I'll be fine. And then some days I eat something and it feels terrible.\n[doctor]  Are there any things that make your symptoms worse that you can pinpoint, like food choices or stress?\n[patient]  Sure, probably stress and food choices sometimes.\n[doctor]  Okay. What things bother you?\n[patient]  Spicy foods. So I try not to eat them too often, but sometimes even drinking a soda can cause it.\n[doctor]  We do know that caffeine and caffeinated beverages will do that even sodas. Even just the carbonation can cause that. How about tomato based products or citrus products?\n[patient]  Yeah, sometimes, but I still eat them.\n[doctor]  Okay, it's reassuring that you aren't having any difficulty swallowing now. How's your weight been? Pretty stable?\n[patient]  I'd say pretty stable, although I haven't had much of an appetite for the past two months. I have been under a lot of work stress.\n[doctor]  What do you do for work?\n[patient]  I'm a paralegal.\n[doctor]  Okay. And any family history of GI issues?\n[patient]  um... my grandmother had a soft agio cancer\n[doctor]  on your mom or dad's side.\n[patient]  Mom's side and my mom had some issues like acid reflux and she was taking some medication that coats the lining of your stomach.\n[doctor]  Okay. Have you ever had an upper endoscopy?\n[patient]  I think maybe when I was younger.\n[doctor]  But none the last 10 years?\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  Have you ever tried any medication other than Omebrizol?\n[patient]  Um, at one point I was on a mepazol and rented a T9. It did help. But other than that, those are the only medications I have taken.\n[doctor]  Okay, have a seat here and let me listen to your heart and lungs and then we can talk about a plan for you.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  So, normal physical exam per my new patient template, except for well-heeled abdominal surgical scars noted. What's this surgical scar here on your abdomen from?\n[patient]  I always forget about that surgery. I had it when I was a baby. My mom said my intestines were twisted. So I had to have surgery when I was around one month old.\n[doctor]  HM, gotcha. Okay, so let's talk about what you have going on. From what you've told me, it sounds like you've had a several-year history of GERD, which is the medical term for acid reflux. And recently, your symptoms have been poorly controlled with the Omepprazole, 40 milligrams twice daily. You've been having heartburn despite taking this medication, correct?\n[patient]  Yes.\n[doctor]  And you've identified trigger foods like spicy foods, carbonated bev, beverages, citrus, and tomato based foods, but you haven't cut these foods out of your diet completely yet. So the first thing I'd try is changing your diet because these foods can exacerbate your gird, even though you're taking the PPI.\n[patient]  Okay, yeah, I could definitely do a better job of avoiding those foods.\n[doctor]  Great! So stress is another trigger that we need to address. High stress can cause worsening of your symptoms.\n[patient]  Yeah, stress and anxiety are definitely big problems for me.\n[doctor]  So working on that may help with your GERD. Additionally, we can consider trying a different PPI since the only one you've tried up to this point is Omeppersol. If you're okay with this, we can switch your Omeppersol to Nexium.\n[patient]  That's fine with me. I'm definitely open to trying whatever.\n[doctor]  Perfect. I will send a prescription for next-sem 40 milligrams twice daily to your pharmacy on file. I'll also recommend that you have a procedure called an EGD or upper endoscopy to look for potential causes of the gird. We'd sedate you and then pass a small camera through your mouth, down your throat, through your stomach, and end in the small intestines. We'd look for any ulcers or signs of precancerous or cancerous conditions that we can take biopsies at the same time if we see anything.\n[patient]  Okay, can I schedule that today?\n[doctor]  Yeah, you can get scheduled at checkout desk. I'll have you follow up with me in the office for the EGD, so we can discuss the results and talk about how you're doing with the dietary, stress, and medication changes. How does all of that sound?\n[patient]  That sounds good.\n[doctor]  Perfect. I will walk you to the checkout desk. Be sure to call my office and let me know if anything changes or if you have problems before your eGD and follow up appointment.\n[doctor]  Please insert the procedure paragraph in the plan. I suspect that she likely has girded with underlying functional etiology as well. reassuringly, she has no unintentional weight loss and denies any dysphagia. If her EGD is normal and her symptoms purse, persist despite a trial of nexium, we can consider a trial of prognics and obtain a pH impedance study. This will allow us to rule out abnormal acid reflux exposure and to decipher between a functional etiology and hypersensitivity.",

She was referred by her primary care physician, Dr. Scott.\n\nThe patient reports severe acid reflux that has increased in severity in recent years. She explains that she has struggled with acid reflux since approximately age 12 and she describes a burning sensation in her chest that travels up her esophagus. She denies any dysphagia, abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, changes in bowel movements, constipation, diarrhea, and rectal bleeding. She also denies any unintentional weight loss, although she admits to having a poor appetite due to her being under immense stress for the past 2 months. She has identified triggers for her symptoms, including stress, spicy foods, soda, and citrus or tomato-based products. She admits that she does still eat her trigger foods sometimes despite the exacerbation of her symptoms.\n\nMs. King has been taking omeprazole 40 mg twice daily for approximately 1 year. She believes that the use of omeprazole provides some relief of her symptoms as there are some days when she is asymptomatic. The only other medication she has tried is ranitidine which she took concurrently with omeprazole and she believes this helped.

            "src": "[doctor]  Next patient is Michelle King. Date of birth, May 7, 1982. Please use talk template. She was admitted to District Regional Hospital on June 29, 2021, and was discharged on July 2, 2021. The patient is a 39-year-old female with history of quadriplegia due to a prior spinal cord injury. She was experiencing increasing concerns for spasms and lightheadedness, significant constipation, and reported diapheresis. She was evaluated in the emergency department where she was a febrile and had significantly elevated white blood cell count of 23,000. There were concerns for ongoing urinary tract infection, but she was treated with four antibiotic therapy. She had label blood pressure, headache, and vomiting. In the end, she slowly improved. She does have a superpubic catheter. Researchers were obtained and reviewed. She was eventually discharged after clinical improvement of her symptoms. She presents today to follow up regarding these concerns. Hi, Michelle. How are you doing?\n[patient]  Not too bad in yourself.\n[doctor]  I'm good. Thanks. So, it looks like you had an infection, right?\n[patient]  Yeah, but you know, I really don't think it was a UTI.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  I told them when I went to the ER is that your phone?\n[doctor]  It is yeah. It listens to you and me and it does all of my documentation. It's pretty good stuff. Tell me what's going on.\n[patient]  It is in my humble opinion that I was just constipated and that was what was causing my blood pressure to be so high. And I hardly pooped when I was there. Then when I got home, I had a massive poop and I felt much better. I told them that when I was admitted and they did x-rays and everything, but they said no, as they didn't think that wasn't. That was it. But you know, I felt so much better when I got home and finally pooped.\n[doctor]  Okay, and the white cell count was the only thing that I think they were kind of concerned about because it was a little high.\n[patient]  So I wondered if automatic disreflexia can affect the white count.\n[doctor]  Typically it doesn't.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  But I mean when I looked at the urine cultures that they checked, the cultures are not very impressive.\n[patient]  Yeah, that's what they said.\n[doctor]  And when I go back and look, sometimes your white count is just elevated a little bit, and last year it was normal so...\n[patient]  HM\n[doctor]  But in saying that, you know, inflammation can do that. So, yeah, you could be backed up and inflamed.\n[patient]  Yeah.\n[doctor]  They didn't do a cat scan. They just didn't X-ray. But you feel like you're back to your normal self now?\n[patient]  Yeah, I mean, I went in because I knew my blood pressure was out of control.\n[doctor]  Yeah.\n[patient]  It was giving me a headache and making me throw up. And I know, at that point, I'm at the loss of what I can do at home.\n[doctor]  Yeah, it was good that you went in.\n[patient]  So I went in and they made me feel better and then I went home as you know.\n[doctor]  Well, maybe that's all it was.\n[patient]  Yeah.\n[doctor]  So you're doing good otherwise.\n[patient]  Yes, I am.\n[doctor]  Good. Let me take a quick listen to you.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  All right, go ahead and take a few deep breaths and breathe normally. Now take several deep breaths and two more. Okay, good. You can relax. Any pain or discomfort anywhere.\n[patient]  Nope.\n[doctor]  Great! So, here are my thoughts.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  You may recall it was extremely hot during that period leading up to you going to the hospital. I don't know if you were inside for the most part.\n[patient]  Yeah, it was pretty hot wasn't it? And I go out a bit, but I do tend to stay in more when it's hot.\n[doctor]  Okay. Well, if you do get dehydrated, even just a little bit, it can lead to further or worsening constipation issues.\n[patient]  MM\n[doctor]  I've had a lot of patients over the last couple of weeks coming in with just weird stuff, and I blame that a little bit on how hot and humid it was the last two weeks of June. So what I would do is wait a couple of weeks, and then if you could come back in, and we could do some complete blood work, including your white blood cells, and a full panel of cholesterol since it's been a while.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  and it should normalize, but it's too soon to do it now. But maybe if I put some labs and you could come in two to three weeks...\n[patient]  Sure, I can do that.\n[doctor]  Great! So that appointment will let us kill a bird. Two birds with one stone since you're due to get blood work anyways for cholesterol.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  And then I just wanted to make sure that the white count is okay, because if it remains elevated then, that means there's something else going on with your bowels.\n[patient]  MM\n[doctor]  I don't think that's what we'll find, but we'll see.\n[patient]  I mean, I knew going in that I hadn't had a regular bowel movement in a while, even though I drink the mirror-lacks every day.\n[doctor]  Yeah.\n[patient]  Why don't go? I double up on that.\n[doctor]  Have I ever given you lactilus? It would be a medicine you use in conjunction with Mirolax, sort of a rescue type thing.\n[patient]  Is it the stuff that comes in a bottle?\n[doctor]  Yes.\n[patient]  Then yes, I have it. It takes about two days to work and then it's a brutal two days.\n[doctor]  Got it. Yeah, it can be a little rough, but it works.\n[patient]  Yeah.\n[doctor]  All right, so we have our plan. Any questions?\n[patient]  Yeah, well, I would like to talk to you about COVID if we can.\n[doctor]  Sure. So, where are you at when it comes to the vaccine?\n[patient]  I'm unvaccinated.\n[doctor]  So, what are your concerns about the vaccine?\n[patient]  Well, we don't know the side effects.\n[doctor]  Correct, we don't.\n[patient]  It's too soon to tell the side effects, and I'm hearing more and more reports of people getting what's now termed as vaccine injury.\n[doctor]  Right.\n[patient]  which I had never heard of before. I don't know if it's a new term or not, but my take on the whole thing is that I'm young and healthy enough to beat it. Even if my respiratory is limited, I also take a lot of vitamin C.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  I also take multivitamins and I'm closely monitored. So I guess I don't feel as though I really the vaccine.\n[doctor]  Well, my thoughts are that you actually should be vaccinated. I think you are high risk. If you get COVID, it's not going to be good for you.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  And I think it's safe. I mean, I understand and hear you. All of these stories out there about this, regarding the vaccine. But I've seen all the bad things that could happen from COVID. People have died in my practice. And I don't disagree that if you got COVID you'd probably be okay.\n[patient]  Yeah.\n[doctor]  But I would consider you as someone that would make me a little bit concerned. I have had healthy people die from COVID.\n[patient]  MM\n[doctor]  I've had some people get really, really sick from it. So personally, I believe that this vaccine is completely safe. I really think that.\n[patient]  All of them.\n[doctor]  Yeah, I do, I do. I think there are side effects from all vaccines, so you have to go back and think about it. Do you get flu shot every year?\n[patient]  No, I don't.\n[doctor]  Right, well, it's hard for me to convince you because you're making a consistent viewpoint.\n[patient]  Well, I'm open-minded to this.\n[doctor]  To me, it's, you know, a lot of the stuff out there is fear and most of us health providers have gotten the vaccine. We've seen what the virus can do. I also have gotten all of my kids vaccinated.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  So I'm not concerned about the side effects of this. I don't think it does anything. And we have vaccinated 50% of the country.\n[patient]  MM\n[doctor]  The ear is full of these vaccines.\n[patient]  I understand.\n[doctor]  So there are definitely potential side effects to the vaccine. I mean, there's guia bar and all these things that could happen from the vaccine, but they're just very rare. My thing for you is I'm not convinced that there's alternative stuff or even the treatment we have, like the monoclonal antibodies that will give help, but it's just my opinion.\n[patient]  Well, that's what I'm here for.\n[doctor]  Yeah, right now the numbers are low. Even with the delta variant when it starts mutating, it's actually good because it becomes more contagious but less deadly.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  So that's what's going to happen with COVID. That's what's M.O. most of the science supports, and this is how most pandemics end, is that the virus starts losing its potency.\n[patient]  Sure.\n[doctor]  But think about it. And if you have any more questions, you can certainly let me know, okay?\n[patient]  \uc624 mirror\n[doctor]  Alright, anything else we can discuss today?\n[patient]  Nope, I think I'm all set. Thank you.\n[doctor]  You're welcome. So we'll see you in two to three weeks. Have a good rest of your day.\n[patient]  Thanks you too.\n[doctor]  Next line heading will be acute to chronic constipation. She believes her hospitalization was more likely due to her dysreflexia from her quadriplegia that typically occurs. She did have a lot of vital signs changes, including blood pressure fluctuations. The patient feels like she has a good bowel regimen, including taking the mirrorlax regularly as a primary treatment for constipation issues, as well as lactolose for severe constipation. She feels like this was less likely a true urinary tract infection, and was just related to her constipation. However, we did have a good discussion regarding her leukocytosis.\n[doctor]  I would recommend just in the next three or four weeks to come back in for some updated fasting labs, and we'll repeat the CBC just to make sure her white blood cells tend downward. Next line and heading will be quadriplegia. Next line and heading will be COVID vaccine status. Again, she's hesitant. We had a good discussion, and I recommended that the only true preventative mechanism for COVID is the vaccine. I do not believe that supplements are necessarily going to help stave this off. I would be concerned if she doesn't get the vaccine, and I would consider her at high risk based on her quadriplegia status. She does not want to get COVID. However, she needs to make these decisions. She is somewhat homeopathic.",

Uh, what did you do last night?\n[patient]  I watched my face with the benzal peroxide. I put the tre-tre-tre-trononon cream. That's such a- sorry. I don't know how to say that for night time and the sunscreen moisture stuff again.\n[doctor]  All right, all right. Now have you had any redness, peeling, dryness or irritation with the use of these medications at all?\n[patient]  Nope. Not all.\n[doctor]  Excellent, excellent.

I think that what I have using on your face is a 4-5%. Usually the back and chest can handle a little something stronger. That's the only thing I would think about changing. Otherwise, I think this looks great.\n[patient]  Sound good.\n[doctor]  All right, uh, do you have any questions for me?\n[patient]  um, edanche.

Any problems?\n[patient]  Now no problems, just still the numbers on this side.\n[doctor]  Okay, that area of numbness will get smaller as the nerves that innervate the skin across the knee heal.\n[patient]  Right? Okay.\n[doctor]  So let me take a look at your right knee.\n[patient]  Sure.\n[doctor]  Alright, and relax for me. Good. Alright and bend. Good. That looks good. Um, the incision looks nice.\n[patient]  MM\n[doctor]  Let's look at your X-rays. They look good. So here's what you got going on in there. Uh, it looks good. Everything's lined up nicely. Um, that's looking at it from the front. And this is looking at it from the side. And then this was underneath your kneecap. But we didn't do anything there. But things looks great.\n[patient]  Okay, I'm so happy with how the surgery went. I have no pain.\n[doctor]  Yeah, you know, you're still early in your recovery, so I expect you to get even better than what you are now. So keep doing your point to work on your strength, range of motion, and endurance.\n[patient]  Okay, we'll do.\n[doctor]  You're probably still going to have aches and pains occasionally. I usually tell people it's two or three months before you feel like you're back to yourself again, so you're doing really well.\n[patient]  Okay, that's really good to know. Thank you.\n[doctor]  Yeah, let's plan to talk again in six weeks. So if you stop at the desk on your way out today, they're going to get you set up for a telemedicine visit. And that visit will just be to check in and see how you're doing and make sure things are progressing okay.\n[patient]  Sure, okay. And can I ask you about work before I go?\n[doctor]  Sure.\n[patient]  Well, as you know, I work for UPS and I'm not able to go back yet because of going up and down steps with the position I have. However, they're asking me to come back to work where I can sit for the shift with brakes.\n[doctor]  Okay, I don't want you lifting greater than 5 or 10 pounds and no standing or sitting longer than a half an hour. Usually that means you can't do a UPS job.\n[patient]  Alright, so would you write a note to excuse me for another six weeks?\n[doctor]  Sure, I'll have my nurse and a give it to you.\n[patient]  That's great. Thank you.\n[doctor]  Okay, so we'll talk again in six weeks and we can discuss your job again at that time.\n[patient]  Sound good.\n[doctor]  Yeah, those are the types of jobs that take a good three months until you're kind of ready to get back to doing that kind of labor intensive work.\n[patient]  Okay, and driving now.\n[doctor]  We have plenty of data that says normal reflex time is returned at six weeks, and then your return to driving is determined by when you're ready and feel safe to be driving.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Yeah, so hang tight. Anna will bring that note back into you, and we'll talk in six weeks.\n[patient]  Alright, that sounds good.\n[doctor]  But keep working hard on point in the meantime though.\n[patient]  I definitely will. Thank you.\n[doctor]  Alright, have a good rest of your day.\n[patient]  You as well.\n[doctor]  Okay, this is a six week post-op meeting exam for her. Her gate was entailed with a slight length and decreased velocity. She's not using an assistive device. Right knee-focused exam has a healed surgical scar, mild swelling, tenderness, tenderness.\n[doctor]  On the area of the incision, range of motion is 0 to 120 degrees. Everything else normal.

            "src": "[doctor]  Okay, next patient is Ashley James, date of birth December 27th 2006. Ashley is a 14 year old female, who was previously healthy, now here for evaluation of abnormal renal ultrasound with an atrophic right kidney. Hi, good afternoon, Ashley. How are you doing?\n[patient]  I'm doing okay. How are you?\n[doctor]  I'm doing well. Thanks so much for asking. I'm Dr. Rogers. I'm one of your kidney doctors, and you guys must be mom and dad.\n[patient]  Yes, that's correct.\n[doctor]  Great. Well, all right. It's so nice to meet all of you. I wish it was under better circumstances, but we're going to figure it all out here today. Speaking of that, let's go ahead and review some of your past medical history, and then I'll complete an exam of her heart and lungs and kind of move from there. Would that be all right with you, Ashley?\n[patient]  Yeah, that sounds good.\n[doctor]  Okay, so as I understand it Ashley was found to have a small kind of a small kidney on one side. Tell me about when that was. I do also have records of everything, but I just like to hear the story of how it was found out and what you're doing that got us here today.\n[patient]  Sure. So Ashley came home one day sick out of nowhere, rubbing her stomach, and she said it was hurting on her right side. And it was so bad that she was bent over in pain.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  We automatically thought appendix.\n[doctor]  Sure, that makes a lot of sense.\n[patient]  We took her to her doctor. They treated her for a stomach virus. They get her fluids and sent her back home, and the next day she was twice as bad as the first day.\n[doctor]  Goodness. Okay. Then what happened?\n[patient]  Yeah. So I took her back again and they did more testing. I think they did an ultrasound or something, and that's where they found that one kidney was bigger.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  Um, then at that time they told us to follow up with our primary the next day, which we did. Um, but he was heading out on vacation, so he only saw her for a brief 10 minutes, and then we were out the door. So she was still throwing up, in a lot of pain, so I took work off to help her.\n[doctor]  Wow. Okay.\n[patient]  Uh, we took her down to Jacksonville, where they did see her and basically told us the same thing, that they didn't think one of her kidneys was working at all. They called it a trophic and that it was a lot smaller than the other one.\n[doctor]  All right, why? Then, then what happened?\n[patient]  Yeah. Then, um, they found cysts or something on her kidney and ovaries and maybe some other places. Her lymph nodes were swollen and they found some infection. Um, they told us to follow up with her doctor, which we figured since she was still sick.\n[doctor]  Okay, and then when you follow it up with your doctor, what happened then?\n[patient]  Yeah. It didn't seem to be getting any better within a day or two, so we followed back up with her doctor, who was, of course, still out of town with no one to see her in his place. So we ended up coming to Atlanta. We stayed here for about four days. Um, they did see her and treated her.\n[doctor]  Okay. I am so sorry for all of that back and forth, but glad to know that there was some light at the end of that tunnel.\n[patient]  Thank you. And then after they saw her, she did seem to get a little better. She hasn't had any more throwing up or anything since, but she still complains about a lot of pain in her stomach.\n[doctor]  Is it? Ok\n[patient]  Yeah. And she mentions burning too, especially when she eats and stuff like that.\n[doctor]  All right, why? Okay. Well, that was a really good review. So, Ashley, before all of this, would you say that all in all, you are a pretty healthy child?\n[patient]  She is, yeah. Before that, she was completely fine. Uh, they said they think at some point she had a severe infection that might have affected her kidney.\n[doctor]  Got you. Okay.\n[patient]  So one other thing, too, when she was four years old she was in the hospital three or four times, sometimes for three days at a time. I don't think they did any tests to see what the infection was or even where it was coming from. They just gave her fluids and antibiotic and they would send us home.\n[doctor]  Hmm, okay.\n[patient]  Yeah. And so a week or two later, she would have a fever and symptoms and basically the same thing. We went through that for a couple of months, and then it just stopped. So she had no problems since, but the doctor suspects that she's had kidney problems since then. So we just want to see if she's all right or if she, if it needs to be taken out maybe. We want to do whatever needs to be done.\n[doctor]  Yes, absolutely. It sounds like this road has been very much so rough to navigate to, so we'll get you through for that. Um, is Ashley taking any medications daily right now?\n[patient]  Only PEP said.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  Yeah. So she takes 40 milligrams of pepsidae and then also takes claritin for allergies.\n[doctor]  All right, why? And any difficulties with your pregnancy with her or during delivery?\n[patient]  No. Um, renal disease does run in my family, though. My dad, aunt, and my cousins all have issues with their kidneys. I have their paperwork right here for you with their diagnoses.\n[doctor]  Great. I will definitely review that over. Any other family history to be aware of?\n[patient]  Yes. My mom had breast cancer too.\n[doctor]  Okay, great. Alright, why? So just stay over a quick review. It does look like your father had a kidney transplant. Is that correct?\n[patient]  Yes, that is correct. He did.\n[doctor]  Okay, so obstructive neuropathy. It sounds like he was born with it and something made it so he couldn't urinate correctly. Does that sound right?\n[patient]  Yes, and they didn't catch it in time.\n[doctor]  I'm so sorry to hear that.\n[patient]  Yeah. He actually died at 47 of a massive heart attack.\n[doctor]  My goodness. Wow. I am so sorry to hear that. But thank you so much for, you know, all of these bits and pieces really helped me to a story together for Ashley so we can get her the best care.\n[patient]  You're welcome.\n[doctor]  Okay, so you said her aunt also has had kidney disease?\n[patient]  Yes. Well, it was my dad's sister, so her great aunt.\n[doctor]  Okay, and okay. I'm looking here. It looks like, do you know what the name of diagnosis? It doesn't seem to be mentioned.\n[patient]  Um, this is what she sent me, and stage renal disease. Chronic kidney disease stage 5, diabetes, hypertension, that's all I have, uh, to work on for her.\n[doctor]  Okay, and that's okay. Let me see. That is all when she was an adult when all of that happened.\n[patient]  Correct. Yep.\n[doctor]  All right, why? Okay. And it also looks like Ashley has seen a GI and a geneticist where they didn't find anything sick, clinically significant mutations on the panel that they did.\n[patient]  Yes.\n[doctor]  Okay, so that's all good. So Ashley, a few questions for you if that's all right. How are you feeling right now?\n[patient]  I'm not feeling too bad. My stomach just hurts just a little bit. It's burning a little bit.\n[doctor]  Okay. And any pain when you go pee?\n[patient]  Sometimes it's just hard to start, sometimes.\n[doctor]  Okay. And any blood in your pee?\n[patient]  No, not that I'm not interested.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  She does complain that it burns when she peas when she drinks certain drinks, um, like soda. So she'll only drink gatorade or water.\n[doctor]  Okay, yeah. So we do see that some people are very sensitive when the drink certain items, especially the carbonation. It can make it burn a little bit when they urinate. Okay, so a lot of different pictures of our kidneys here, and we'll review all of that here in a moment.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  All right, why? But before we review that, I want to look through a quick exam and just see how things are doing. You'll hear me speak aloud the exam just to make sure I'm getting everything documented.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  All right, why? Please use my physical exam template. So, Ashley, I'm going to listen to your lungs and heart if you'll just breathe normally for me. Okay?\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Good. Lungs and heart sound great. All right, why? So your physical exam, you know, everything we see up here is, you know, you're a well-appearing female, alert and oriented, sitting comfortably on my chair today, I hope, with not acute distress, exam, otherwise with norm within normal limits. Okay. So where does that all leave us? The good news is that her kidney functions do look good as, as does her blood pressure. We'll want to keep on eye on both of those things as she is at a higher risk for developing high blood pressure and something that we call protonuria, which is where your kidneys don't work as well as they should, and we end up seeing protein in your pee.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  or excuse me her pee. Her right kidney is a little bit smaller, which is making her left kidney work harder, possibly causing the left to peer bigger. And it's something that we want to keep an eye on, but nothing for us to do with anything today.\n[patient]  Okay. Thank you.\n[doctor]  I also recommend that on an annual basis, we do kind of the following things. So I want to have an ultrasound to monitor the size of her kidneys and their overall function, complete a urinalysis to continue to make sure that protein and blood are not in her, in her pee, and do a blood pressure check. Additionally, let's avoid non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines like ibuprofen and optus Tylenol instead.\n[patient]  Okay. That sounds good.\n[doctor]  Okay, and does Ashley play any sports?\n[patient]  Yes. She is active in softball and she wants to join the drill team over the summer.\n[doctor]  How fun! I used to play softball back in the day. Um, so it'll be very important that during those activities she stays well hydrated. I really want to avoid dehydration, as it puts tremendous strain on her kidneys. So, I'm going to recommend at least two liters per day of water.\n[patient]  Okay. Great. We will work on that.\n[doctor]  Okay, I also recommended a healthy diet and continue her active lifestyle. This will help keep her and her kidneys healthier as an adult. So if we can start those behaviors early, we'll be in a good space as she progresses.\n[patient]  We can do that. We already do try to eat. Uh, very well.\n[doctor]  Good. Good. So for her next appointment, she can either meet with her primary care physician or an adult nephrologist closer to you guys at home. You don't have come all the way out here.\n[patient]  Okay. That sounds great.\n[doctor]  Okay, that was a lot. Do we need any additional questions clarified or anything? You can always give us or your primary a call if you think of anything or if, certainly, if symptoms worse.\n[patient]  No. I don't have any additional questions, and I'll definitely give you a phone call if we do. And thank you so much. This was so helpful.\n[doctor]  Awesome. Well, thank you guys for making the trip. And Ashley, it was really nice to meet you. Mom, dad, you as well. And I hope you guys take care.\n[patient]  You too.\n[doctor]  All right, why? Past medical history, review of patient's grandfather's record. We see he had posterior urethral bowel's valves and obstructive norinoropathy. He developed chronic kidney disease and was on dial, was dialysis dependent. He had a renal transplant which subsequently failed, died of dialysis in his 40s. Wait, is that right?\n[patient]  Now that you've started, it does. I don't understand the he and less they were giving, the grandfather's record. But did you want to do this on your own this recording?\n[doctor]  Yeah, that's yeah, that'll work because I'm gonna have to drop for this. But I think we're good for everything else.\n[patient]  and he did die in his 40s. That's what it said in the note earlier.\n[doctor]  Okay. Yeah, he died in his 40s, but I thought it was from a massive heart attack. Died at 47 of a massive heart.\n[patient]  He died. It's saying that it meant it means he died on Jaya like he was he was um utilizing dialysis.\n[doctor]  Not because of it. Okay.\n[patient]  Yeah.\n[doctor]  I see what you're saying.\n[patient]  Yeah.\n[doctor]  Got it. Cool. I'm gonna stop.",
            "tgt": "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nEvaluation of abnormal renal ultrasound with atrophic right kidney.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nNext patient Ashley James is a 14-year-old female, previously healthy, who is here for evaluation of abnormal renal ultrasound with atrophic right kidney.\n\nThe father details a history of the patient coming home sick one day with extreme right-sided abdominal pain. Her parents brought her for evaluation, and they treated her for a stomach virus and administered fluids prior to sending her home. The next day, the patient's pain was more severe. The patient returned to the doctor's office and an ultrasound and additional testing was performed which revealed left kidney hypertrophy. At that time, they were encouraged to follow-up with her primary care physician. The patient was seen briefly by her physician the next day, which was insignificant. Ashley was still experiencing stomach pain and vomiting, her father brought her to another facility in Jacksonville. At that location, the patient's family received information that her right kidney was nonfunctioning, atrophic, and smaller than her left kidney. Additionally, cysts on her kidneys, ovaries, and other locations were found. Her lymph nodes were swollen, and she had \"a lot of infections\". The patient was sent back to follow-up with her primary care physician. The patient was unable to follow back up with her primary care physician as he was still out of town. The patient came to Atlanta, remained here for 4 days, was evaluated and treated with subsequent improvement of her symptoms. She has not vomited since.\n\nPrior to her current medical complaints, the patient was healthy. The etiology of her kidney issues is believed to have been caused by some severe infection the patient experienced, possibly as a child.\n\nWhen the patient was 4 years old, she was hospitalized 3 or 4 times, for up to 2-3 days each time. She received fluids and antibiotics, and then discharged. Her father reports that no workup was ever performed to rule out infections during these hospitalizations. A week or 2 post-discharge the fever and symptoms would return. This kept recurring for approximately 2 months and then it spontaneously resolved.\n\nThe patient is still experiencing some stomach burning. She reports hesitancy while urinating and she states she has to wait for her urinary flow to commence. She endorses occasional dysuria. Ashley denies hematuria. Some beverages are associated with dysuria, thus the patient drinks mainly water, Gatorade and V8 juice.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nThe patient plays on softball team and is interested in joining a drill team over the summer.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY\n\nPaternal Grandfather: Deceased approximately 47. Myocardial Infarction. Posterior Urethral Valves. Obstructive Neuropathy. End Stage Chronic Kidney Disease was Dialysis dependent. Failed Renal Transplant.\nPaternal Great Aunt: End Stage Chronic Kidney Disease is Dialysis dependent. Type II Diabetes. Hypertension.\n\nNo family history of polycystic kidney disease.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS\n\nPepcid 40 mg once daily.\nClaritin as needed for allergies.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nConstitutional\nWell-appearing female adolescent, sitting comfortably on the exam table in no acute distress.\n\nNeurological\nAlert.\n\nRESULTS\n\nAbdominal ultrasound, 03/22/2021.\nCT abdomen and pelvis, 03/22/2021.\nCMP, 03/22/2021.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\n\u2022 Renal hypoplasia.\nAshley is a 14-year-old female who presents today for evaluation of abnormal renal ultrasound with atrophic right kidney. She has right-sided renal hypoplasia with a small atrophic right kidney discovered incidentally on imaging for abdominal pain. Imaging shows compensatory hypertrophy of her left kidney. Otherwise, she shows no sequelae of chronic kidney disease and enjoys normal blood pressure. Her urinalysis is without sediment. She has normal kidney function with creatinine of 0.62, which equates to an estimated GFR of greater than 90 mL/min per 1.73 m\u00b2, and normal serum electrolytes and acid base status. Ashley is at higher risk of hypertension and proteinuria, which will need to be followed annually.\n\nPLAN\n\nYearly ultrasound to monitor the hypertrophic left kidney and atrophic right kidney. Also, on an annual basis I recommend completion of a urinalysis to assess for proteinuria and blood pressure checks. The patient should avoid use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications and use Tylenol for pain and fever. It is also recommended that she stay well hydrated, avoiding dehydration, especially while participating in sports, by consuming 2 L of water per day. I counseled the patient and family about the importance of a healthy diet and remaining active to avoid future comorbidities that may put her at increased risk for chronic kidney disease as in adult.\n\nThe patient does not need to follow up with a pediatric nephrologist but can instead follow up with her primary care physician or an adult nephrologist closer to home.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nSchedule follow up appointment with local adult nephrologist or primary care physician.",
