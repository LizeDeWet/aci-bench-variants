Let me do a quick physical exam on your back here if you bend forward. Does that hurt?\n[patient]  Not right now, but normally it would.\n[doctor]  Okay, so no pain with flexion. How about if you stand back up?\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  Okay, no pain with extension. Either does it hurt while you're just standing here.\n[patient]  Yes.\n[doctor]  Okay, so pain when you're weight bearing does a hurt when I push right here on the left side.\n[patient]  Yes.\n[doctor]  Pain with palpation to the left side around the L5, how about on the right side?\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  No pain with palpation to the right side. Okay, I'm just going to push down on your feet. Can you push back up on my hands?\n[patient]  Yes.\n[doctor]  Alright, Dorsiflexion is normal looks like that you have normal range of motion so that's good any pain down your legs.\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  Great no nerve pain, all right? So we took an X-ray. When you came in, it looks like you don't have any fractures or anything on the spinal bone that's good. You can see where you had surgery. It looks like everything is healed properly there. So that's good news. So what I think you did is you have a muscle pull there from having a misalignment in your spine. So what I'm going to do is I'll prescribe some physical therapy for you. You have great physical therapy here at the VA. So you can just come right to our physical therapist and that should help have you have you been there before.\n[patient]  Yes.\n[doctor]  How do you feel about it?\n[patient]  I really go to the dentist.\n[doctor]  Got it okay, so I'm also going to prescribe you some Meloxicam instead of the ibuprofen that might help a little bit more with some of the pain management.\n[patient]  Is there any chance I can get some vikin?\n[doctor]  Let me check your record quick for for pain management. It's kind of a strong drug for vikiden and we don't really like to prescribe that unless it's totally necessary. So why don't we start with the moloxic am? And I also write a referral to pain management and they can talk to you a little bit about some of your pain and maybe not using narcotics to manage it.\n[patient]  How about some Demarol?\n[doctor]  I'm sure I'll prescribe Demarol.\n[patient]  Thank you.\n[doctor]  Yeah, you're welcome, any other problems going on today you want to talk about.\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  Alright, well, it was nice to see you today.\n[patient]  It's always nice to see you as well.\n[doctor]  Alright.",

Other than spontaneous flare-ups, his pain is worsened with excessive spinal flexion. Stretching and ibuprofen 800 mg daily are helpful, but he denies having tried icing the area.\n\nSURGICAL HISTORY\n\nThe patient is status post lumbar microdiscectomy performed in 11/2020.\n\nMEDICATIONS\n\nThe patient reports that, prior to his microdiscectomy in 2020, he was taking high-dose gabapentin for severe nerve pain through his back and lower extremities. He is currently taking ibuprofen 800 mg daily.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nMusculoskeletal: Reports left-sided low back pain.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nMSK: Examination of the lumbar spine: No pain with flexion or extension. Pain with weight-bearing. Pain with palpation on the left side around L5. No pain with palpation on the right side. Dorsiflexion is normal. Normal range of motion. No nerve pain in his lower extremities.\n\nRESULTS\n\nX-ray images of the lumbar spine were obtained and reviewed in office today. These reveal no evidence of fracture or other abnormalities in the spine or vertebrae. His previous surgical site is visible and appears to have healed properly.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nLow back pain, left side.\n\nPLAN\n\nAfter reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I believe his symptoms are related to a muscle strain due to spinal misalignment. I recommend that we treat the patient conservatively with formal physical therapy and meloxicam. The patient requested a prescription for Vicodin and Demerol. I explained that Vicodin is a strong medication for this issue and that I would need to refer him to pain management for that, but I did provide him with a prescription for Demerol.",

Yeah, yeah, I was because we don't we don't do the intro anymore. I was just going with that year coming in with sudden visual distortion and blurring a vision. So I'll just you know, I'll just say I'll just go ahead and go into this technician part. So it looks like the technician notice that you've been having a decrease in vision when reading and straight lines and your door frames have been looking crooked to you.

Do you have the script or know what it just talks?\n[patient]  But it's not presenting like how you're reading it, like how you're talking about it. Is it kind of what I'm saying? Because after that I'm supposed to say, yeah, whenever I take my husband out to a nice restaurant, I have trouble adjusting to those dim lights. But I'm not really getting the question of like, so it's causing it, or where do you have this happening stuff like that? So I'm a little confused.\n[doctor]  Okay, I mean I can just straight out follow the script just so we can kind of get it rolling. So, so I said so high so it looks like the technician notice that you've been having a decrease in vision when reading and straight lines in your door frames have been looking crooked to you.\n[patient]  Yeah, and whenever I take my husband out to a nice restaurant, I have trouble adjusting to those dim lights.\n[doctor]  Okay, so do you have a favorite restaurant you like to go to?\n[patient]  I do McDonald's is one of my favorite here in Arlington.\n[doctor]  That sounds good. What what do you what's your favorite there?\n[patient]  They have a great eggplant parma john one of my favorite. So I just go ahead and go with that.\n[doctor]  That sounds really nice very good.\n[patient]  It's just...\n[doctor]  Yeah, okay. Well, so it looks like you're still smoking a pack of cigarettes a day.\n[patient]  Yes, I try to stop smoking every now and then, but still been hard to totally stop.\n[doctor]  Okay, and how is your blood pressure been doing? Are you keeping up with your medication?\n[patient]  I take my blood pressure when I can remember to do so.\n[doctor]  Okay, yeah, it's really important to keep up with your blood pressure check that regularly. I'm totally going off script and you know might want to keep a log of that as well and check your blood pressures regularly. So, okay, well let me do it just a quick exam of your eyes if you can take off your glasses and just rest your chin on the chin rest okay. So the anterior segment examination reveals posterior chamber interocular lens is in. Both eyes right eye the cornea is clear no and the eye style cup to disc is. Two funnest examination of the right eye shows the retina to be attached 360 degrees without any tears or holes or P changes in the phobia posterior segment exam shows Ducin in the macular thickening of the retina presence of sub retinal fluid and exudates accumulation positive for hemorrhage left eye the cornea is clear no and the eye cup to disc is. Three or P changes in the phobia no hemorrhage or sub retinal fluid retina is attached okay. So I reviewed the results of your diagnostic tests so for the so it shows Ducin deposit and the retinal pigment epithelium sub retinal fluid accumulation coroidal neovascular membrane can be visualized fluorescine angiography reveals focal areas of leakage in the right eye consistent with neurovascular age related macular degeneration. So the diagnostic tests and the eye exam are really indicative of. Neovascular age related macular degeneration so this is advanced to a stage that usually leads to more severe vision loss and it really happens when those abnormal blood vessels start to grow beneath the retina and they will leak fluid and blood and hence the name wet AMD and can create a large blind spot in the center of the visual field and this is really with the most common cause for severe loss of vision so my plan is to give you an injection of Lucenne's once a month it's injected into the vitrious portion of the eye after it's been numbed and injections are given regularly over a period of time it may slow the rate of vision decline or stop further vision loss but however the disease and loss it may also progress despite treatment do you have any questions\n[patient]  I do not know that sound great.\n[doctor]  Okay.",

How are you doing?\n[patient]  I'm thankful to be alive, but definitely struggling and definitely scary time for me.\n[doctor]  Yeah, you know I'm I'm glad that we went ahead and sent you to the emergency room. Now I know that you were in the hospital for about 48 hours. How are you feeling since you've been home? You've been home a couple of weeks now. How are you doing?\n[patient]  Yeah, they told me to really take it easy. So I just been doing very light work. I don't really do much outside of just sitting around and taking my medication, but I would say I'm doing okay. I feel like I have a little, I don't feel perfect, but I feel better than you know I did.\n[doctor]  Okay, and have you had any more of that chest pain since they put that stand in or is that completely gone?\n[patient]  I have not had any chest pain since Noah Louis knows sore right after surgery, but that doing much better now.\n[doctor]  Okay, and I know that they went through your wrist for the cardiac catheterization. How is your wrist doing?\n[patient]  It's good I you know is red for a while, but it seems to be healing and I think there's no infection.\n[doctor]  Okay, and you're right-handed correct.\n[patient]  Correct yes right-handed.\n[doctor]  Okay, alright, and any shortness of breath when you walk around or move anything like that.\n[patient]  Yeah, I would say, you know, I've been trying to keep my mind. I'm not doing a lot of exercise, but I will say that when I go up and downstairs, you know, I do feel like I have shortness of breath.\n[doctor]  Okay, now I know they put you on that medication, the brilinta, are you you're taking it correct?\n[patient]  Yes, I take it twice a day every 12 hours.\n[doctor]  Okay great, and you're still taking your aspirin correct.\n[patient]  I take the baby aspirin at night. Is that okay?\n[doctor]  Yeah, that's perfect as long as you take it once a day, and you're able to afford the Berlinta, any issues with costs with that.\n[patient]  Now I so far so good.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right, so it's really going to be really important for you to go ahead and continue to take these medications to prevent that stent from clogging again. Okay, or prevent that stent from closing because we don't want you to have another heart attack.\n[patient]  Okay, yeah.\n[doctor]  Okay, and how about watching your diet or are you able to watch your salt intake? I know that you really like to good pizza every now and again are you.\n[patient]  Yeah, I have eaten pizza a few times what I'm trying to do is really be diligent and eat well throughout the week. And then I have had pizza a few times on the weekends is that okay.\n[doctor]  You can have a piece here, and there you know the pumping function of your heart was pretty normal when I saw from the hospital your rejection fraction. That's the pumping function of your heart was at about 50%, which is, you know, low normal, but not bad, so that's good. So, okay, just I would just watch your salt intake, okay.\n[patient]  Okay, yeah I've been eating a lot of vegetables and in chicken without salt on it.\n[doctor]  Okay great, and then you know I am I'm glad that you're taking it easy now or mind me this might cause you some anxiety where the Denver Denver Nuggets swept or did they end up winning are they still in the NBA playoffs. I forget I know that you're a Denver Nuggets fan.\n[patient]  I am yeah, they they're not sweep they were down three games, but they wanted the last one. So there's a chance for it come back, but they they play again tomorrow.\n[doctor]  Okay, yeah, I'm a self-expand and and we just swept the Brooklyn net so I was really excited about that\n[patient]  Congrats that that's always good to sweep the nuts no one no one likes them.\n[doctor]  No one likes them. Okay. Well, let's I want to just go ahead and do a quick physical exam. I'm just going to be calling out some of my exam findings and I'll let you know what that means when I'm done. Okay. So looking at your blood pressure here in the office, your blood pressure looks good. It's about 127 over 60, which is pretty good on your neck exam. I don't appreciate any jugular venous distension. There is no carotid roots on your heart exam. I do appreciate a slight three out of six systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base on your lung exam. Your lungs are nice and clear to osculation bilaterally. And on your musculoskeletal exam, your right radial artery cardiac cathocyte is clean dry. And intact, there is no hematoma and there is a palpable radial pulse. Now, what does that mean? Betty, so all of that means is that you know you have a little bit of a heart murmur after having the heart attack, but I looked on the echocardiogram and it showed that you know you do have mild. My troll regurgitation, which is just, you know, a little floppy valve, which is as fine as we'll just keep an eye on that. And then everything else for the most part looks good. So let's just talk a little bit about my assessment and plan, okay. So for your first problem of your inferior myocardial myocardial infarction, I want to go ahead and continue with your aspirin, continue on your brilinta, you're going to stay on the brilinta for at least one year and aspirin, you're going to take lifelong until I tell you to. Okay, I want to go ahead and have you continue on the Crestor 40 milligrams once a day. And I'm going to go ahead and put in another echocardiogram for about six months. Okay, do you have any questions about that?\n[patient]  Yet do you think I can know that sounds good I have one other more question though.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  Do you think that I can swim again? I'm misswimming.\n[doctor]  Yes, so at this point you're out like two weeks and your cath side is looks good so you can go ahead and then resume swimming now with that being said, I would want you to just do a few laps here and there I do want to enroll you into cardiac rehab that's going to give you a bit more confidence to go back to exercising and they also give a lot of dietary education and counseling in cardiac rehab. Does that sounds like something that you can do?\n[patient]  Yeah, I think I have to.\n[doctor]  Okay, I agree. Alright, I also want you to go ahead and continue with your Toprol 50 milligrams once a day. And I'm going to go ahead and order some liver function studies and a lipid panel to follow up with the next time we meet. And I want to see you again in probably six weeks. Okay.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Okay, any questions?\n[patient]  No, I think that's a thank you very much.\n[doctor]  Okay, take care bye.",

And you know, like he went down, so I went down, I hit it on the curb like it's really kind of it was sore, I gave, I took some ibuprofen, and I like washed it out and put a bandaid on it, but it's just been like kind of hurting every day since then, so I scheduled an appointment.\n[patient]  Okay, is it getting better getting worse or just kind of lingering on?\n[doctor]  It's just holding on and I tried taking medication, right? I took some ibuprofen and it was fine. It just like it keeps coming back and I read on the label and not supposed to take that stuff for more than two weeks, right?\n[patient]  Well, all it all, depends everyone's different we'll get to that.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  And he was not bothering you at all before this normal name.\n[doctor]  Yep.\n[patient]  Never okay. Alright, what do you do for living?\n[doctor]  While I work in a children's hospital so I like play around, I am I'm a baby rocker professionally. I go into like the niggus and I rock some of the babies.\n[patient]  Gotcha, what do you do outside of outside of work is biking kind of your thing.\n[doctor]  No, that was his thing, and I think that's why we fell I shouldn't trust him, but most of the time I go on walks with my dog.\n[patient]  Okay, we broke up with him already, you're.\n[doctor]  No, I didn't know that Ne injury was a reason too, but now that you've told me maybe we should talk about that.\n[patient]  We'll talk about that later too.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  Alright, so let's take a peek at your knee here.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  You're going to stick it through the screen or how you're going to do this alright.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  Alright then.\n[doctor]  I'm just going to grab your leg, we're just going to take it through, just let it relax. I'm just going to take it through a little range of motion. I'm going to kind of poke around all different places you tell me where it hurts okay.\n[patient]  Okay, okay.\n[doctor]  Alright now I'm poking, I'm poking, I'm poking so on the inside part here.\n[patient]  Is this where hurts?\n[doctor]  Yeah, like when you touch it, it really hurts.\n[patient]  Right there okay tell me what's worse here or here.\n[doctor]  on the inside.\n[patient]  Okay, so medial joint line tenderness.\n[doctor]  Hmm.\n[patient]  P.S. Berza, Nontender, Epicondyle, Nontender back of our knee nice and soft any pain back here.\n[doctor]  No, I don't think so.\n[patient]  Okay, Poppleyill Space is non-tender how about over on this side.\n[doctor]  No, okay, lateral side, non-tender skin. She has got about a dime size little abrasions. Dry looks about a week-week old right over the medial patella. Everything else looks good. No scars, okay. How about can you straighten it out all the way? I can, but sometimes it like hurts a little bit like it almost like it clicks.\n[patient]  Yep, that's good though, full full extension. How far can you bend it?\n[doctor]  all the way back.\n[patient]  Okay, let's see.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  Good good and how about the other side? Let me see the left knee. Can you bend that one all the way back too?\n[doctor]  Yeah, that's fine.\n[patient]  Okay, full, full symmetric flexion, no no deformities go ahead and just let it relax.\n[doctor]  MMHM Valgus stress medial collateral ligament intact lateral collateral ligament intact okay. So little kind of little laxity posterior. Draw, let me see the other, let me see the other knee.\n[patient]  and Mimumya so that that feels pretty much normal. So she's got about a 1 plus posterior drawer anterior drawer negative lockman, negative good? Let's go ahead and just kind of bend it straight in for me.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  Good patella patella tracks. Fine, no crepidus. All right, let's go back to this medial side of your tender right there. Is that right?\n[doctor]  Yeah\n[patient]  It's tender on a medial joint line, but actually negative, McMurray negative lateral side, negative, McMurray good. So pretty stable, you feel like you're kind of shifting back a little bit on this side compared to the other side. Does it feel unstable when you walk? Does it feel like it shifts?\n[doctor]  Yes, sometimes.\n[patient]  What's the worst thing that you can do that you don't like about that knee? Is it walking, standing, sitting, still, getting up from a chair in, and out of the car, what don't you like?\n[doctor]  Walking up a hill like any kind of incline really hurts.\n[patient]  Yeah, and you're just your week, or is it?\n[doctor]  Hmm.\n[patient]  You actually know.\n[doctor]  Yet hurts no.\n[patient]  What about you? I mean, are you real weak?\n[doctor]  No, I would say I'm pretty strong.\n[patient]  Did you go to the gym?\n[doctor]  I go to the gym, but I swim so the...\n[patient]  Okay, I can't treat people like you, you, you, you need to work harder. I quit complaining, okay.\n[doctor]  Yes sir, work harder okay.\n[patient]  Do-do-you-play sports in college or high school?\n[doctor]  I did in high school.\n[patient]  Yeah, so in you and you still doing anything athletic now other than just rocking kids.\n[doctor]  No.\n[patient]  Just kind of your thinking walking the dog.\n[doctor]  Yeah rocking kids and walking dogs and going on the occasional swim.\n[patient]  on the occasional swim. All right, how have you been swimming since you hurt your knee?\n[doctor]  No, no, I haven't, would you recommend that.\n[patient]  While I'm not sure yet, it's because we might have to do surgery on your knee here and take that leg off.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  It's pretty bad.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  We'll get to that too.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  So did you already have x-rays of this knee today?\n[doctor]  Yes.\n[patient]  Okay, do I go into that too?\n[doctor]  Yeah\n[patient]  Look at the x-rays, do you? Or just stop here, you can okay, okay. And so, what would happen now? You would you could pause it.\n[patient]  You're only cup of this.\n[doctor]  Let's take a look at your pictures here. And all right, so this looks pretty just looking at it. It looks pretty normal, looks pretty healthy. You can see how I all the edges of the bones here look pretty good. I don't see any bone spurs of that. I don't see anything broken. Everything looked looks pretty good kneecaps tracking good. You can see the space here. There's no real space there. That's actually cartilage. So that looks pretty healthy. And you can see the other side looks. Both both look the same. So X. Raise, look, I don't see anything obvious on that. But looking at your knee here, you may have hit that tibia bone and kind of push that bone back. It feels to me like you may very well have sprained your or injured your posterior cruciate ligament. That's what it's feeling like.\n[patient]  Hmm.\n[doctor]  I'm not going to know that for sure, or if there is other things going on in there. But I think getting an MRI scan to look at what you may have done inside there, I'm pretty suspicious though that you may have injured that ligament. If that's the only thing you did very rarely, is this going to need surgery, okay? So this may be something we want to get you into a brace here, get you into some therapy and get all your motion back and get your strength back. And then maybe check it back in a few weeks and see because a lot of times those ligaments can tighten back up.\n[patient]  It's it's odd for just an isolated posterior ligament to need surgery.\n[doctor]  Hmm.\n[patient]  But if there's other things going on, I can't tell you for sure that you didn't injure a meniscus too, or maybe chip some cartilage when that bone shifted. So let's get an MRI scan to look at that. If that comes back with just a ligament, like I'm suspecting hopefully, this is something we can treat with some therapy and some bracing for a while and get this thing back to normal, if after that couple months later or so you still have instability and still bothering you, then it's possible we may have to do some surgery to fix that ligament.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  Does that make sense?\n[doctor]  Yeah, yeah, so in the meantime though, do you want me to still keep taking the ibuprofen? Yeah, I think that's fine for a short, if it's helping the big thing right now, is we want to get your strength back and your motion back get rid of the swelling that we still see here.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  So that will help with that. Ice ice packs a few times a day. You can take the ibuprofen up to three times a day. And I'll look all we'll look at the dose here. There are some other medicines we can try that maybe don't have to take so often that may be easier.\n[patient]  MM\n[doctor]  So I can even send in a prescription for you for something that maybe just twice a day a little easier for you to take without skipping doses.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Okay, you can just take it with breakfast and dinner.\n[patient]  MM\n[doctor]  We'll try and see if it works better if your IB Profen works better though go ahead and just go back to that but we can try this other prescription first.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  It's not very expensive and I can just call it into your pharmacy.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  And then we can get the brace fitted to you today. We are not going to look at a big, big custom kind of expensive brace. We will just put because it may just be temporary.\n[patient]  MMMM\n[doctor]  And then I will get you a referral to physical therapy, something that you can do close to home or close to work.\n[patient]  And then maybe I could see you back here in maybe four to six weeks and recheck this.\n[doctor]  Okay, how often am I going to have to go to physical therapy?\n[patient]  I'm going to kind of leave that up to you in the therapist I would start with a couple visits. And then we'll just really see how you progress. And what you could do at home, if what if you have access to some equipment or things that we need to do. But I want you to go, you know, at least a few times. So somebody can kind of keep an eye on you, make sure you're doing the exercises right.\n[doctor]  Okay, already think that sounds good.\n[patient]  Did you get to do you select you last night?\n[doctor]  I did.\n[patient]  Yeah, what do you think? What do you roof for?\n[doctor]  I so, I am a little heartbroken right now I was for the rockets and the way that these nets are crushing them. It's just it's just painful.\n[patient]  Are you serious?\n[doctor]  Yeah\n[patient]  Rockets!\n[doctor]  I live in Dallas, yes.\n[patient]  Yeah, that's not that's not my problem, but you have not do you not watch the balls.\n[doctor]  No, no.\n[patient]  My gosh, all right, we're gonna have to work on you.\n[doctor]  Okay, thanks.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Bye.\n[patient]  You got four to six weeks to get your attitude straight. We'll talk about this later, okay?\n[doctor]  Yes sir.\n[patient]  Alright, very good any questions at all.\n[doctor]  No.\n[patient]  Okay, so.",
            "tgt": "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nBeverly Howard is a pleasant 33-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right knee pain.\n\nThe patient reports that she fell off of a tandem bicycle and struck her right knee on a curb approximately 2 weeks ago. After the injury, she took ibuprofen and treated the wound, but the pain has persisted. She localizes her pain to the medial aspect of the knee. She also reports occasional clicking with full extension of the knee, as well as occasional instability with ambulation. The patient states that her pain is the worst when ambulating up an incline. She denies any previous right knee issues. She enjoys walking her dogs and swimming but has not done this since her injury.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nThe patient works in a Children's Hospital.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nMusculoskeletal: Reports right knee pain, clicking, and instability.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nSKIN: Warm, dry and intact\nMSK: \nExamination of the right knee: Tenderness along the medial joint line. Pes bursa is nontender. The epicondyle and posterior aspect of her knee are soft. Popliteal space is nontender. The lateral aspect of her knee is nontender. There is a dime-sized abrasion that is dry and appears to be 1 week old, over the medial patella. No scars. Full extension. Full symmetric flexion. No deformity. Valgus stress of the medial and lateral collateral ligament are intact. Laxity with posterior drawer testing. 1+ posterior drawer test. Negative Lachman test. Patella tracks fine. No crepitus. Negative McMurray test.\nExamination of the left knee: Full symmetric flexion. No deformity. Valgus stress of the medial collateral ligament is intact. Lateral collateral ligament is intact.\n\nRESULTS\n\n4 views of the right knee were taken. These reveal no evidence of any fractures or dislocations. Joint space is well preserved. No other abnormalities are noted.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nRight knee pain, possible posterior cruciate ligament sprain.\n\nPLAN\n\nAfter reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, we had a lengthy discussion in regard to her current symptoms. I explained that her x-rays did not reveal any signs of a fracture. I recommend we obtain an MRI of the right knee to evaluate for a possible posterior cruciate ligament injury. In the meantime, I have recommended that the patient be placed in a brace to provide increased support. I have also recommended that the patient attend formal physical therapy to work on her range of motion and strengthening. I advised her to ice her right knee a few times a day to reduce the swelling. She can continue taking her ibuprofen if she finds this helpful, but I am also going to send in a prescription medication she can take less frequently. The patient will follow up with me in 4 to 6 weeks to check on her progress.\n\nORDERS\n\nMRI, right knee\nPrescription medication",

            "src": "[doctor]  So, hi Zachary, good to see you today. So I'm looking at my notes I see coming in with some right elbow pain. And you also have a past medical history of hypertension diabetes. We're going to check on those. So can you tell me what happened to your elbow?\n[patient]  I just woke up one day it was hurting.\n[doctor]  It was hurting okay how long ago would you say that was?\n[patient]  Since...\n[doctor]  Since yesterday, alright.\n[patient]  It's actually my left elbow, my left arm.\n[doctor]  Okay, they must have written that down wrong, so it is your left arm. Are you right-handed or left-handed?\n[patient]  Right-handed.\n[doctor]  Okay, so do you think you might have slept on it wrong or anything like that or what?\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  So, what part of your elbow would you say hurts?\n[patient]  from my elbow all the way up to the to the neck.\n[doctor]  elbow up to the neck. All right, is it your entire elbow or or would you say a individual part of it is painful?\n[patient]  Just from the elbow up to the neck all the way up the arm.\n[doctor]  all the way up the arm alright.\n[patient]  or all the way down the arm to the elbow.\n[doctor]  Okay, and what would you describe the pain as is it like a stabbing pain? Is it numb what's going on?\n[patient]  kind of a archinist, archinist heaviness.\n[doctor]  Autiness, okay. Did you do anything yesterday that you think might have caused the pain?\n[patient]  to suggest a usual day of working around the house.\n[doctor]  Okay, do you remember? I know sometimes, dude, chores you end up lifting heavy things. Do you remember doing that?\n[patient]  No, no, nothing, nothing really unusual, you know, mode grass, and that's about it.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right, have you taken anything for the pain yet?\n[patient]  Some motoring.\n[doctor]  Okay, and would you say that worked for you?\n[patient]  Not really still kind of comes and goes and aches.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right. So we'll take a look at your arm there because it's like your entire left arm up from your shoulder to your elbow does hurt and a second we'll do an exam of that. So I see you're also coming and we're going to check on your hypertension and you came in today your blood pressure is a little bit high. It was 150 over 90. I don't think we talked last time about us getting you a blood pressure cuff. So you could take those and keep track and and and and let us know so what. Have your blood pressures been running lately?\n[patient]  125 over 72.\n[doctor]  Okay, that's not.\n[patient]  Average.\n[doctor]  That's not too bad, you might have a little white coat syndrome you see me today, because it's a little bit high today, so you're on that too. Five of Norvask have you been taking that?\n[patient]  Yes.\n[doctor]  Okay, that's good. How about your diet? How is that going? I know you were having a little trouble before your sod intake was a little bit high.\n[patient]  I think I'm doing okay so.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  I'm doing okay.\n[doctor]  Alright, so as far as your diabetes, your last time you came, and let's say look at your A1C result, it was a 7. Two you were on the 500 of metformin, so what have your blood sugars been running?\n[patient]  I don't really check them.\n[doctor]  You don't check them okay, so yeah, we can get a glucose test today. And just check those because that's something we want to do every day, just to make sure you're eating the correct amount and that your sugars are in range to make sure that and also to make sure that our medication is the right amount as well. So we'll do that that glucose test at the end of your visit and we could see if we can adjust your medication or not so. Let's go ahead and do a physical exam on you. So I just want to double check, make sure are you having any chest pain.\n[patient]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, on and off. So it kind of comes with elbow pain or pain.\n[doctor]  Okay, comes with elbow pain, arm pain.\n[patient]  Chest pain.\n[doctor]  Chest pain.\n[patient]  It kinda goes up my neck sometimes too.\n[doctor]  Up your neck alright.\n[patient]  Yet that whole side just takes comes and goes.\n[doctor]  Comes and goes all right how often is that chest pain happening to you? You said it's not constant.\n[patient]  It just started yesterday.\n[doctor]  Okay, so every hour, every 15 minutes, would you say?\n[patient]  I don't know, mostly I had to stop mowing grass the other day, it bothered me a little bit. But other than that, it just kinda comes and goes, I guess, a few times a day.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right, have you had any shortness of breath?\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  No, okay, just the chest pain alright.\n[patient]  Yeah.\n[doctor]  So I'm going to listen to your heart here and it it just seemed like I do hear a slight murmur with your heart here and I don't think we've heard that before so I think I'm going to get an EKG as well because I'm concerned you might be having like a mild heart attack. So because you have the pain all the way up your elbow that go into your neck and your chest pain as well I don't think it's its musculoskeletal pain because you said you hadn't done anything with it so far so what I want to do is and let's talk a little bit about my assessment plan here so I do think that you or you do have that chest pain. I'm concerned that you know you might be having a mild heart attack. I'm going to get EKG for that we're also going to get you some aspirin is a nitroglycerin just to see if it helps with that pain as far as your for your diabetes. I want you we're going to get that pioct glucose and we'll keep you on B5. 100 of metformin for now and then for your hypertension wheel. Keep you on that too. 5 of of norvask but I think our most immediate issue is these the chest pain and so we'll do the EKG and depending upon those results we'll call 911 because we really need to get you to the hospital if that is the case so how does that sound.\n[patient]  I don't know why I was talking to my brother and he's a he is a hard doctor and he kind of thought maybe it wasn't the heart but.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  He thought maybe I had he thought maybe I had something joby had you know they took joby to the hospital.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  So you heard you heard that did you?\n[doctor]  I didn't hear about that no.\n[patient]  Yeah, he he he he he couldn't stop there.\n[doctor]  Okay, could stop doing what?\n[patient]  You can't start pooping.\n[doctor]  Now while you're I didn't hear about Joe biting and and his his not ability his ability did not stop pooping probably had a diarrhea I'm not sure I didn't hear about that but most of the time\n[patient]  No, it could have stopped pooping rushing.\n[doctor]  could not poop and you said pooping.\n[patient]  Yeah, I know.\n[doctor]  It couldn't stop pooping, yeah, I mean that that might cause like anxiety or something like that you know we can't stop putting his, his, his in charge of my United States, but right now I'm really, you know me, I'm concerned about your heart. So I do want to get the EKG just to make sure you know it'll be wouldn't be good if we didn't get that you know in the case that you leave here something terrible happened. And, and I wouldn't want that to happen on my watch so.\n[patient]  Right?\n[doctor]  We'll definitely get those tests.\n[patient]  appreciate it.\n[doctor]  Yeah, no problem. We'll get those tests and my nurse will come in and we'll take it from there. Does that sound good?\n[patient]  Okay, all right. Thank you so much.\n[doctor]  Alright, thanks.\n[patient]  Yeah.",

It's nice to see you again. Listen, I'm sorry, you're not feeling well. And you've got abdominal pain, like, to talk about that in some detail with you. But, hey, I want to use this new cool app that's going to help me focus on you a bit more in this visit wood that'd be okay with you.\n[patient]  Sure, that's fine.\n[doctor]  Okay, great. So, so, Karen, tell me about your abdominal pain, what's been happening.\n[patient]  Well, it started about 10 days ago, with just some mild discomfort in on my right side, and it seems to be getting worse over the last couple of days, especially.\n[doctor]  Okay, and how bad would you say the pain is like it's a zero to ten on a scale today?\n[patient]  Yeah, it waxes and wanes and severity. It's in general probably around a four or five. But sometimes it gets up as high as a seven or eight.\n[doctor]  Okay, is there anything that you notice that makes that pain worse or better like rest or movement or eating or anything else?\n[patient]  It's usually a little worse after a meal.\n[doctor]  I'm okay.\n[patient]  In a morning before I've eaten, it's not too bad, but during the day after a meal it gets worse.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right. And do you notice that pain radiates anywhere or moves you know anywhere?\n[patient]  It's pretty low it might radiate a little bit to the left, but otherwise it's pretty localized to the right side.\n[doctor]  Okay, and have you had any nausea or vomiting along with the pain?\n[patient]  I've had some nausea and a little bit of heartburn but no vomiting.\n[doctor]  Okay, and this is this is this is worse with you said worse worse with meals and is there anything else anything else that that makes it worse\n[patient]  It is a little tender if I press on it, and certain positions seem to make a little worse when I'm most when it's the highest.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  Pain.\n[doctor]  Okay, sure any pain with urination or any blood in your urine.\n[patient]  No no urinary symptoms.\n[doctor]  Okay, and how about any diarrhea and any of that are blood in your stool now?\n[patient]  No change in bowels.\n[doctor]  Okay, alright, and so would you say that your appetite has been normal or decreased or any different?\n[patient]  Well, since I'm a little nauseated, I'm not quite as hungry and I feel just kind of a little overall, a little more fatigued over the last week.\n[doctor]  Okay, okay, you didn't overeat, you know, during the Super Bowl last weekend, did you that was I know probably lots of junk food floating around if your house is anything like mine?\n[patient]  Well, once the packers are out of the playoffs, I don't watch the Super Bowl, so nothing I haven't eaten anything unusual.\n[doctor]  Okay, well that's good, that's good. And no, no travel. I know you're a big, big travel travel fan. You know, I remember you telling me about your trip to Europe last summer. That sounded amazing. Have you been traveling outside of the country again recently?\n[patient]  not recently just back to Wisconsin, but no unusual travel or other exposures.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right, great. And okay, so tell me about your migraines. How have they been? Are you still taking the Sumatriptin you know as needed? When when you developed migraine, you have had a migraine recently.\n[patient]  I have not usually their responsive to just X-Cedron migraine. I use the Sumatriptin when I need to if it if it doesn't respond to the over-the-counter analgesic.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  So\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  It's been a day been pretty rare.\n[doctor]  Okay, okay, great. Yeah, you've learned a lot about it and the treatments, including the terminal gzic and all of that that's pretty impressive you've been through the ringer, I think with with those so okay. And so you're taking accedrine when you get a migraine and then sort of would you say maybe for breakthrough migraines or worse migraines you take a sumatriptin occasionally.\n[patient]  Yeah.\n[doctor]  Okay, got it. And how about your blood pressure? How has that been running at home? Are you checking your blood pressures daily still? And how, how, how have your blood pressures been?\n[patient]  I have not been checking them daily. I probably check it about two or three times a week.\n[doctor]  Hmm.\n[patient]  And the pretty good the upper number is usually around in the 120s or low 130s and the lower number usually in the 70s.\n[doctor]  Okay, okay not too bad. It does look like you're a little bit elevated today. I may be I'm just making you nervous though, so I hope not so are you. But you're still on my Sinoprol 20 milligrams per day correct? It looks like you might be running low. Do you need a refill of that?\n[patient]  Yeah, actually I was going to ask you about that if I could get a refill that would be great.\n[doctor]  Sure we can do that, and so okay, but you're still taking that 20 milligrams per day correct.\n[patient]  Correct.\n[doctor]  Okay, and all right, fair enough. So let's go ahead and examine you now. Karen's so on your physical exam, pretty normal and unremarkable. For the most part on your on your heart exam, I do hear that grade three out of six systolic ejection murmur that you've still got that's unchanged from prior exam. That just means I hear some heart. Sounds you know as I'm listening to your heart there. I'm not too concerned about that. We'll watch that. Otherwise, normal cardiovascular exam and then you're your abdominal exam, gastrointestinal exam. If you have some tenderness in the right upper quadrant, I would say mild to moderate tenderness. And now if you take a deep breath, does that? And I press here, does that hurt you?\n[patient]  Yes.\n[doctor]  Okay, yeah, you have, I would call, an equivocal Murphy's sign in the right upper quadrant on your abdominal examination as well. The rest of your abdomen is soft and no significant tenderness. You have no tenderness in the right lower quadrant with deep palpation and you have no CVA tenderness on your back exam as well. And so we will talk about about that. I am a little bit concerned about the tenderness that I find on your abdominal exam. The remainder of your exam Karen is pretty normal and unremarkable. And so that's good. Let's, let's talk about my assessment and your plan. So first of all, for your first problem of abdominal pain, you do seem to have acute abdominal pain with right upper quadrant tenderness that I'm concerned. Maybe a sign of some gallstones or possibly even an infection in your gallbladder. So I'm going to order some blood tests and an ultrasound today. I'm going to order a CBC-KEM-12. Your analysis, a pregnancy test, and also right upper quadrant ultrasound. And so we, well, we will get those tests done right away. I'm going to keep you here. We'll see how those look. Fortunately, we've got the facilities for those. And if we need to send you to the emergency department based on those results, we will I don't want you to eat anything right now. Okay. In case we find something that might require surgery, all right, unlikely. But it's possible. And then okay, you know Karen, I meant to ask you on your history one thing by chance. Have you had a fever along with this abdominal pain?\n[patient]  I've had some chills, but no documented fevers.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right, all right, good, yeah, I see you don't have a fever today, so that's that's good. And so right now for your second problem, the migraine headaches, you do have a history of chronic migraines and you have occasional bouts of of migraines, nothing recent. So let's continue the et cetera and as needed over the counter for treatment there. And then also the sumatriptin as needed for breakthrough migraine pain. And I would just encourage you to continue to avoid alcohol, benches and caffeine. And try to get enough sleep and all of that's easier said than done I know so. But that seems to be helping you now for your third problem of hypertension, your blood pressure seems to be under adequate control. So that's good. We'll continue you on the lysinoprol 20 milligrams per day. And I will write you a refill prescription for that. And send that to the pharmacy. Please continue to check your blood pressures daily. So Karen, how does that all sound for a plan? Any other questions for me?\n[patient]  I actually do need to refill my sumatriptin as well.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right, sure you know problem. So for your migraines, the migraine problem, I'm also going to write you that that refill prescription for Sumatriptin and anything else you can think of.\n[patient]  Know the plan sounds good.\n[doctor]  All right, sounds good. We'll see you back in about four weeks or so. And actually, I am going to follow up on your results today before I let you go, but I'll check on those and then we'll see how how you do and hopefully be able to get you home today. So we'll go from there. I'll see you shortly.\n[patient]  Thank you.",

I was around my sister and she has been sick with the same kind of symptoms. And so this cough has just started off with like a gradual cough. And now I've just been coughing up some green flem here.\n[doctor]  Okay, okay. So you started having some mucus with it.\n[patient]  Yes.\n[doctor]  Okay, and how about any other symptoms with your cough?\n[patient]  I'm having a little bit of a sore throat here, and then a little bit of some nasal congestion as well.\n[doctor]  Okay, okay. And how about any fevers?\n[patient]  I haven't had a fever yet.\n[doctor]  No fever, okay, and then any shortness of breath.\n[patient]  No shortness of breath.\n[doctor]  No shortness of breath, okay. And what have you been doing for your cough?\n[patient]  I've just been kind of drinking lots of water, taking some cough medication over the counter, and it seems like it's not really working.\n[doctor]  It's not helping okay, and tell me do you have any history of any seasonal allergies?\n[patient]  Right around springtime, I get a little bit of sneezing and the runny runny nose.\n[doctor]  Okay, okay. And then any how about any body aches for you?\n[patient]  No body aches.\n[doctor]  nausea or vomiting.\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right, so we will definitely examine you and talk more about that. And as far as your diabetes, how has everything been going with that checking your sugars, how has that been going?\n[patient]  I've been pretty good at checking my blood sugars they've been running around 120 range.\n[doctor]  Okay, okay, and I know them at Foreman is a we started you on a lower dose. It's the 500 milligrams. It's a new medication for you. You've been tolerating it, okay?\n[patient]  Yes, I haven't had any problems.\n[doctor]  Okay, good any diarrhea, sometimes patients will say that.\n[patient]  No diarrhea.\n[doctor]  No diarrhea, okay. And then how about as far as your blood pressure?\n[patient]  Blood pressure has been a little bit high I've noticed.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  kind of 140s the top number.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  And the lower numbers seems like it's been okay around 70s.\n[doctor]  70 okay so a bit high and the hydrochlorothia side. Have you been able to take that every day?\n[patient]  Yes, I've been taking it every day.\n[doctor]  Okay, and how about your diet, how's been thing as far as salty foods?\n[patient]  I've been trying to stay away from the salty foods, but sugar intake. I'm having a little bit of trouble with that.\n[doctor]  Okay, okay, but it seems like you've been making good progress and that could be difficult sometimes and you mentioned being around I think you said your sister a few days ago or a family member\n[patient]  Yeah, she was just kind of sick with similar symptoms, and I noticed I started to develop a little bit of a cough right after.\n[doctor]  After that, okay. And how is your family doing how is everyone doing other than that other than being sick for your sister? How is everyone going?\n[patient]  Everyone's doing great.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  working busy with life.\n[doctor]  Okay, and for you two were you on vacation last week and a lot of people had vacation last week.\n[patient]  Yes, I was on vacation last week actually.\n[doctor]  Okay, hopefully you weren't sick for too much of it.\n[patient]  Now I was feeling okay.\n[doctor]  Okay, okay.\n[patient]  Cut back and start feeling poorly.\n[doctor]  Sorry about that alright so what I'm going to do now is I'm going to go ahead and start your physical exam. I looking at your vitals vitals look overall pretty good. I do see your blood pressure is elevated at here. It's 144 over 72 otherwise everything else looks good. So let's check you out. So first starting I'm just going to check start with your sinuses and when I press here do you have any pain any tenderness when I do that?\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  No okay so no frontal sinus tenderness how about when I press on the on your cheeks here?\n[patient]  Maybe a little bit, just a little bit.\n[doctor]  on both sides.\n[patient]  Yes.\n[doctor]  Okay, so bilateral maxillary sinus tenderness, all right. And I'm just going to take a look at in your mouth if you can open up, okay? So I do see some do have some erythema of the farinx and the tonsils are symmetrical. I don't appreciate any exudates now. I'm just checking your neck and I do appreciate some anterior cervical adenopathy, all right. And I'm just going to take a listen to you, all right. So listening to your heart, so you have a nice regular rate and rhythm and you do still have that two out of six. Sistolic ejection murmur at the left base. Now I'm taking listen to your lungs and on your lungs exam, okay, your lungs are nice. And clear I don't appreciate any weasers, rals or ronky, all right. And just looking at your lower extremities, I don't appreciate any edema there. So let's talk about my assessment and plan. So for your first problem of the cough, so looking at your cough, it does seem like you have an upper respiratory infection. And so basically that's a virus most likely it's a virus that's causing your symptoms, especially being around someone else who has similar symptoms and seems like most likely they spread it to you. So I want you to continue with doing a lot of the time is just letting the virus run its course and taking things just to help with your symptoms. So drinking lots of fluids that's going to help you trying. I know you've been doing a cough medicine. You can even try another one you have to be careful with the blood pressure and diabetes. So you can try like a caricidine. HBP can help with the cough and lots of rest, okay, lots of rest now. We are in a current pandemic. And so something I can check for you, if you're okay with that is checking for COVID, if that's okay with you.\n[patient]  Yes, I'm okay with that.\n[doctor]  Okay, so we will check you for that today and see how you're doing with that. And then we will give you those results. Okay, any questions about that?\n[patient]  No questions.\n[doctor]  No, okay. So for problem number two, the type two diabetes. So we'll continue you on your metformin 500 milligrams daily or twice a day you had blood work at your last visit. So you'll be doing it your next visit for your hemoglobin A1C and that's the check the sugars on your red blood cells. So we do that about every three months. So at your next visit, we'll check that for you and then we will go from there. But it seems like you're doing well with that now as far as problem number three or high blood pressure. So your blood pressure is elevated here and it sounds like it's been you know creeping up just a little bit at home as well. You're on a very tiny dose of the hydrochlorothiazide. So what I would like to do is increase it to 25 milligrams once a day again. I would recommend that you take it in the morning just because you may have noticed it can make you urinate quite a bit and then I would love for you to just continue checking as you have been a few times a week just checking your blood pressure at different times of the day. So we can continue to see how you do with that okay.\n[patient]  Okay, all right, that sounds.\n[doctor]  All right, any questions for me?\n[patient]  No questions.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  Thank you.\n[doctor]  Thank you all right so at this point now I'm just going to press the\n[doctor]  I'm gone now.",

So I've been doing a lot with that.\n[doctor]  Wow, okay. And do you know if there was any direct or associated trauma that you can think of over the past three weeks like did you fall or hit your shoulder or anything?\n[patient]  No no trauma that I can think of it all.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  I don't remember hitting it either.\n[doctor]  Okay, now have you ever had pain in that shoulder before?\n[patient]  You know I'm active and we'll have aches and pains here and there, but nothing that some Tylenol can't take care of.\n[doctor]  Okay, and it's isolated to your left shoulder.\n[patient]  It is.\n[doctor]  Okay are you able to move that left arm for me?\n[patient]  You know, anytime I try reaching for something or lifting anything I have a lot of pain and I don't even try to raise my arm over my head because that's it really hurts.\n[doctor]  Okay, so now I want to talk a little bit more about that pain are you having pain all the time? Or does it wax? And when does it come and go?\n[patient]  It's all the time and if there's any pressure like when I try to sleep at night, I can't even lay on a side sleeper and I really give me a hard time because I'm so uncomfortable so the pain is always there.\n[doctor]  Okay, so you can't lay on your left side at all.\n[patient]  I can't.\n[doctor]  All right, now do you have that pain when you lay on your back as well or just on your left side?\n[patient]  I mean it's always there, but when I sleep directly on it the pain goes up.\n[doctor]  Okay now let's talk just briefly about your pain so if you haven't taken anything at all or have you been taking anything at all let's start with that have you been taking anything for the pain.\n[patient]  Yeah, I've been taking Tylenol and I'll take two extra strengths Tylenol every six to eight hours.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  It does help take the edge off.\n[doctor]  Okay, that's good now, without any Tylenol, what's your pain level?\n[patient]  Without any Tylenol I would say my pain is like a 3.\n[doctor]  Okay, and then with Tylenol with that.\n[patient]  I'm sorry I keep doing that without any Tylenol my pain is like a seven and with Tylenol it goes down to a two or three\n[doctor]  Okay, that's good, so the Tylenol really does help you. That's a good thing.\n[patient]  Yeah.\n[doctor]  So you talked about renovating your basement. Did you guys just move in? Or is it just time for a little house facelift?\n[patient]  Yeah, just time we've been living in this house for some time now, and you know what the pandemic we've been home, and so decided to do some work.\n[doctor]  Nice have you been into the new home depot that they just opened down the street here?\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  Yeah, it's nice my wife and I were there this weekend and they just opened two weeks ago, so everything's fully stocked. And if you guys are doing some renovations, you might run down there and you know save big money at Home Depot.\n[patient]  I definitely will check that out.\n[doctor]  So are you experiencing any numbness or tingling in your arm or hand?\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  Okay, so if you don't mind, I'd like to go ahead and do a quick physical exam. I've reviewed your vitals. Everything looks good there. And I'm going to do a focused exam of your left shoulder. Now you have limited active and passive range of motion. There is some tenderness of the greater tuberosity of the humerus. And there is no tenderness at the sternoclavicular or clavicular joints. And you have good hand grip bilaterally. Nurovascular exam of your left arm, your cap refill, is brisk in less than three. Seconds and motor and sensation is intact to light touch now for review of your x-ray of that left shoulder. The good news is I don't see any fracture or bony abnormality. So let me talk to you briefly about my assessment and plan okay. So for your first problem of left shoulder pain, your symptoms are most likely due to rotator cuff tendonopathy. This means that the tendons of the muscles of that left shoulder have been injured and the injury happened to the tendons that make up or attached to the shoulder muscles. I'm going to go ahead and order an MRI of your shoulder just to make sure nothing else is going on with that left shoulder. I'm also going to go ahead and refer you for physical therapy for approximately six to eight weeks okay. Now during that time I want you to continue to take Tylenol PRN. If your symptoms don't improve, we can then consider maybe like a steroid injection of that left shoulder which could hopefully get you some relief. Now, do you have any questions comments or concerns about our treatment plan?\n[patient]  Yeah, so I'm really active, so do you think that this pain will ever go away?\n[doctor]  I do believe that that pain is going to go away many of my patients are successful with point. So we are going to start with that take a conservative approach and see how you do.\n[patient]  Okay, all right.\n[doctor]  Alright, so I'm going to have the nurse come in and get you some paperwork and I'll see you in about two about two weeks.\n[patient]  All right, thank you.\n[doctor]  Thank you.",

She denies any known injury or trauma; however, she is very active and is currently renovating her basement. She denies any associated numbness or tingling as well. While movements such as reaching and lifting exacerbate her pain, full flexion of the shoulder is the most severe. Her pain is also exacerbated if she lays on her shoulder, which subsequently causes sleep disturbance due to her being uncomfortable. She typically takes Tylenol Extra Strength, 2 tablets every 6 to 8 hours, for aches and pains associated with her active lifestyle, and doing so reduces her shoulder pain to 2-3/10 on the pain scale. Without medication, she rates her pain as 7/10.\n\nMEDICAL HISTORY\n\nThe patient denies any previous trauma or injury to left shoulder.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nThe patient reports that she has a very active lifestyle.

And when I went up for a rebound and I came down and I felt like my knee just popped it started swelling and I could hardly walk when it happened.\n[doctor]  Okay playing basketball, how often do you play basketball?\n[patient]  first time in two years.\n[doctor]  First time in two years did you watch the game last night?\n[patient]  Yeah, unfortunately both teams didn't lose, so I was unhappy.\n[doctor]  You're going home who you're going for.\n[patient]  Neither.\n[doctor]  Neither while I was going for UNC, I'm kind of upset right now, but anyway, so you say you're playing basketball, you heard felt some knee or knee pop, what part of your knee would you say hurts?\n[patient]  It feels like it's on the inside of the knee.\n[doctor]  inside of your knee alright and are you able to bear weight on that leg Matthew?\n[patient]  I can now, but I'm favoring it for sure.\n[doctor]  Okay, so what type of pain would you describe as it is it stabbing is it?\n[patient]  It's real achy.\n[doctor]  real achy.\n[patient]  Since I slept overnight, the swelling has went down some.\n[doctor]  Okay, have you taken anything for the pain yet?\n[patient]  I tried some Tylenol yesterday.\n[doctor]  Alright, did that work for you?\n[patient]  A little.\n[doctor]  Little do you have any?\n[patient]  Being off of it helped more than anything.\n[doctor]  Yeah, I bet I bet I hurt my knee before too. And it's pretty painful on a scale of 1 to 10, what would you say your pain level is?\n[patient]  It's about a four right now.\n[doctor]  about a four, okay? So it's not too bad. All right, so we'll take a look at that knee in a second. So we're also here to check up on your hypertension and diabetes. So I'm looking here for your hypertension. You're taking five milligrams of norvask. So are you taking that daily?\n[patient]  Yes.\n[doctor]  Yes, great. I am so happy when my patients are compliant most of the times they don't take it as is often, but I'm really excited for that what have your blood pressure has been running. I think today.\n[patient]  You're about 140 over 80. It's a little bit high, but I know we talked about you getting a blood pressure cuff at home and taking those so I don't check it very often.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  But it's usually in the 140s to 150s range on that top number. And then that bottom number is usually around 80, and I read on the Google that that's OK. Is that OK?\n[doctor]  I mean it's not the best, right? It's we should be around 120 over 80, right?\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  You're a little bit elevated and we could talk about changing your medications to try to get that that down how about your diet house that going.\n[patient]  I eat anything I want.\n[doctor]  All right, well, we definitely got Tugot Tugot to get your diet a little bit better. I know after the pandemic a lot of people, you know, went crazy with the diet myself included, but I know we got to get you get back in because for your diabetes, I'm looking at your A1C and we checked it and it was a A7.2, which is not so good right now. So have you been taking, I think, your on Metformin 500 milligrams daily?\n[patient]  I do, but I got to take it sometimes it upsets my stomach. And so I just kind of skip it.\n[doctor]  Okay, so yeah, we definitely got to get you to take it. We could try something else just if you're having interaction with that medication. What about your blood sugars? Are they taking those daily?\n[patient]  Know every once in a while.\n[doctor]  Every once in a while, what have they been doing every once in a while when when you do take them?\n[patient]  probably about 150 or so.\n[doctor]  Okay, so we got to get those down too. So we will talk about getting you consult nutrition. Just try to get you a better diet. I think you know we want to get you off the medications totally, but you know we got to get you on the right track here. All right, so let me do a quick physical exam on you. I'm going to check your lungs, lungs sound, good check your heart. So listen to your heart. You still do have that grade two out of systolic ejection murmur. All right, but we knew about that already. You've had that for a couple of years. So I'm not really worried about that at this at this time. So let me take a look at your knee here. So when I press right here on the inside, the right knee is that painful.\n[patient]  L\n[doctor]  All right, and let me have you bend it straight and it's painful.\n[patient]  A little yes.\n[doctor]  A little bit, all right, I'm going to do a couple of maneuvers here. So your right knee exam shows that you do have pain to palpation of the medial aspect of that. Right knee also have some edema, some little bit of swelling, some echinosis. As well, you do have a negative varus and valgus test of my maneuvers. And you know, I do see a little bit of a swelling, swelling, little redness as well in that knee, so we did get an x-ray of your knee or right knee luckily, it was normal. So there's no fractures, no bony abnormalities, which is good. So you didn't break anything so based on my ear, based on your x-ray. And your exam you have a MCL, tear well, MCL strain, I apologize MCL. It's straight, I don't know if you have a tear. Yeah, we got Tadia, we had to have to do an MRI for that. But basically means you twisted your knee when you're playing basketball, right? And so that ligament is strained or torn just to have to get an MRI to determine if it is or not in the time being I want you to continue to take. That Tylenol just to help with that pain. I'm also going to prescribe you some maloxicam 15 milligrams just to help with the pain and swelling I'm going to put you in a neomobilizer. And I want you to stay off of that for the next couple of weeks. And we're going to get an MRI as well for that knee, how does that sound?\n[patient]  That's okay.\n[doctor]  All right, for your diabetes, I'm going to need you. We got to get you to start taking your blood sugars daily. We got to keep track of those. All right. So I want you to take those daily. We'll get a log book so you can keep track of those and bring those back. And we can determine how we adjust your medications for now. Also I'm going to give you a consult to nutrition to try to get your diet a little bit better. And then for your hypertension, I'm going to up your medication, up, up, up, up your norvasta. Five milligrams because your blood pressure is a little bit high. And hopefully we can a medication adjustment will lower it down to that 120 over 80, like we like we made all right. So I'm going to see you back in two weeks. Do you have any other questions?\n[patient]  Yes, so I heard strawberries can lower your blood pressures. Are you true to that?\n[doctor]  You know why I haven't heard that before you know.\n[patient]  You know, I know it's normally they say like the pumice granite seeds or antioxidants and in such, but the strawberries I haven't heard you could try it. If you want to actually know, I don't want you to eat too many strawberries because a lot of sugar in your in your.\n[doctor]  Your diabetes isn't going so low right now, so stay away from the strawberries, because that's a lot of sugar you'll need that.\n[patient]  Sure.\n[doctor]  Alright, so any other questions?\n[patient]  I think I'm okay right now.\n[doctor]  Alright, so my nurse will be in without appointment and we will see you in two weeks.",

So, hi there, Mr. Thompson. It's nice to see you again. Listen, I understand you're having some trouble with your blood pressure control. I would like to discuss that with you. But first, I want to ask you, I'd like to use this app, this new fancy app that's going to help me focus on you a bit. More in our conversation with that. Be okay with you.\n[patient]  Yes, that's fine.\n[doctor]  Okay, great. It's going to record our conversation. Okay, perfect. So, Jerry, tell me, Mr. Thompson, tell me about your blood pressure readings recently. I understand your concern about them. They have been up. They have been down what's going on and any other symptoms.\n[patient]  Normally my blood pressure has been very well controlled over about the last three to four weeks. There have been periods where I felt a little light-headed slight headache. And when I check my blood pressure, the upper number has been occasionally over 180, which is way past you know what any of the numbers have been in the past.\n[doctor]  Okay, okay, and okay. And yet, it is sound unusual for you. And so it's been high, but you've also felt light-headed at times have you checked your blood pressure when you were feeling light-headed was it was it low at those times or have you done that?\n[patient]  I've done it both when I felt fine, and then when I had the lightheaded episodes, actually it's been on the high side.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right, understood. And you haven't passed out or anything have you.\n[patient]  not recently.\n[doctor]  Okay, and have you had any chest pain or trouble breathing along with you know your elevated blood pressure?\n[patient]  Sometimes a little heaviness in my chest, but no, no, nothing sustained, and I don't have any respiratory or breathing difficulty.\n[doctor]  Okay, excellent. And how about any headaches or other neurologic symptoms like numbness or weakness or you know balance instability or anything like that?\n[patient]  Little unsteady when I get the dizziness and a slight headache when the blood pressure numbers have been a little higher.\n[doctor]  Okay, and when you say dizzy are you feeling lightheaded like you might pass out or you feeling that the world spinning around you or what?\n[patient]  Just a little fuzzy where you just feel more lightheaded.\n[doctor]  Okay, alright understood. And you've not had any fever or nausea vomiting anything like that have you or diarrhea.\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  Okay, and are you feeling any palpitations or your heart racing anything unusual there?\n[patient]  Not usually no.\n[doctor]  Okay, and are you still taking the lysinoprol 20 milligrams once per day? No, actually, I see we last visit we increased that to twice per day you're still taking that lysinoprol 20 milligrams twice per day.\n[patient]  Yes, I am.\n[doctor]  Okay, you are not missing doses or anything are you by chance?\n[patient]  Very rarely.\n[doctor]  Okay, great, great. You're still using that pillbox that we suggested. I think you had a pretty good system going there. Maybe, maybe you're using that app now to take to keep track of one when to take your medicine. Are you doing that?\n[patient]  Yes, yeah, I've used the pillbox and then tried the app. It was a little confusing but I'm pretty much on on track with staying on my medication schedule pretty accurately.\n[doctor]  That's great. I think I think I remember you saying it was tricky to get that app set up, but then your grandson helped you with it. And those kids amazing what they can do these days, right? Anything like that I always trust them. My kids before me. So, hey, by the way, how did he do in his softball or in his and his little league tournament last month? I think you said he had a big tournament coming up. How did that go?\n[patient]  They did great. They got all the way to the finals. And then the team, that the team that beat them was probably a little older, a little bit more seasoned, but they had a great time.\n[doctor]  Wow, wow, how fun, that's fantastic. Well, congrats, good stuff. All right, well, listen, so you're still taking your your license, April. How about for your hyperlipidemia, your your high cholesterol, there are you still taking that adrobastin?\n[patient]  Yes.\n[doctor]  Okay, excellent. And your osteoarthritis, I know you've been, you know, a golfer in the past. And you know you want to get out on the course. And things is that still under control. Are you able to get out and and and walk the full course and things still?\n[patient]  Most of the time you know there are times when the weather changes that I have to maybe play less play less or skip a day.\n[doctor]  Yeah, but you're still okay while you're still able to get out. And then you're kind of taking, I think you're taking some Tylenol for, you know, mild, mild pain. And changing your activity as needed is that right.\n[patient]  Correct.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right, good, good, okay. Well, listen, let's go ahead and examine you here, Jerry. So on your physical exam for the most part, it's pretty normal and unremarkable on your heart exam. You still have that grade three out of six systolic ejection murmur that's unchanged from your prior. And just means, yeah, I'm hearing some heart sounds from the valves that's not surprising. And I'm not concerned about it. We're just watching that one otherwise. On your your lung exam, you have some mild bivasiler. RALS, but no weasers or Ronkey and excellent air movement. And you have trace lower extremity edema on your extremity exam there bilaterally and otherwise really pretty normal exam. So let's let's talk about my assessment and your plan. All right, so first of all, for your first problem of your elevated blood pressure, I do think your blood pressure is a little bit out of control, meaning we need to make some adjustments I'm going to actually increase your lysinoprol to 60 milligrams twice per day. And I'm also going to add 25 milligrams per day of hydrochlorothiazide. And that should help even things out. I wanted to check your blood pressure measurements twice a day for me for the next two weeks. Then let's see you back in two weeks. And we'll check on how you're doing. And also for your second problem of hyperlipidemia, I want to keep you on the outer vastadine. I'm also going to send couple of blood tests. I'm going to send a cholesterol panel, also a CBC with differential and A comprehensive metabolic panel. And we'll check a your analysis as well. Look and see how your kidneys are doing there as well. And so we'll continue the current management with your outer vastadine there for your hyperlipidemia. Now for your third problem, osteoarthritis. I want you to continue to stay active as best you can don't overdo it, but walking and you know getting out golfing when you can that's great. You can take Tylenol for the pain if you have some mild some mild pain there. And yet otherwise, I think that cover it. I think the adjustments in your blood pressure medicine should help. And I want to see you back in four weeks. No, let's make two weeks and follow up. And otherwise any questions for me. How does that sound?\n[patient]  I don't think so anything that I need to do when the weather warms up as far as you know my fluids drinking liquids and things.\n[doctor]  Yeah, you know, be sure you're staying while hydrated, you know, six to eight glasses of water per day is a good good idea and you know, when it warms up, you're certainly going to prespy or more and lose, lose more fluid. So, so I would recommend that you continue to have, you know, a standard six to eight glasses of a fluid intake per day. But yeah, that you know that should do it and if you're feeling particularly dehydrated, you might want to increase that if you have an increased activity. Levels so, all right, any other questions for me?\n[patient]  How much beer should I drink?\n[doctor]  Probably not the best thing with you know with with your high blood pressure fluctuating the way it is. So not more than a couple drinks a week hate to tell you.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Alright, okay, great seeing you will see you back, see you in a couple of weeks you take care.",

So Donna tell me what's going on.\n[patient]  You'll lately I've just been having quite a bit of a headache and I mean every now and then I'll get it but lately it's just been getting worse and I've noticed that my blood pressure has been running high. I've been taking it maybe like once a week but the past three weeks it's been really high than usual so I was a little worried.\n[doctor]  Do you remember the numbers that you're getting on your blood pressure readings?\n[patient]  Yeah, so one of them was like 160 over 87 and then the last one was like 175 over 92.\n[doctor]  Okay, so it's really high I was looking back and it looks like your blood pressure was pretty normal last time we saw you is 124 over 82 have you been able to take your blood pressure medicine the lysin apparel that you've been prescribed.\n[patient]  I have, but sometimes I forget, I'm on embarrassed to tell you that. But yeah, sometimes I forget, I get busy like especially on the weekends I'm very good during the week, but on the weekends I tend to forget it, and that's when I'm most busy too.\n[doctor]  Yeah, well I'm also curious, you know you have diabetes, have you been checking your blood sugar?\n[patient]  Yeah, I have because I thought maybe you know that's why I'm getting the headaches. Maybe my sugar was too low or maybe too high, but my sugar has been okay. It's been running like 120 sometimes it does get down to like 100.\n[doctor]  Okay, and have you noticed are you urinating more than usual or anything like that?\n[patient]  Not really so much, it's been pretty much the same, but pretty normal.\n[doctor]  Okay, and when you get these headaches, what are you taking for them?\n[patient]  While I take my Tylenol hoping it'll just you know go away and then it does some just for a little bit but then it just goes throughout the day and I start to get them again.\n[doctor]  Okay, and when you first had the headaches, what would you rate the headache at zero? No pain. Ten the worst pain ever.\n[patient]  I would say when I first get them, it's about, I would say, a seven out of ten.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  Yeah.\n[doctor]  And then after you take the Tylenol, what does it go down to?\n[patient]  It goes down to probably about a 4 or maybe 5. I still feel it, I still feel annoying, but it's not as pounding as it normally would be.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  If I didn't take the Tylenol.\n[doctor]  Yeah, and have you ever had headaches like this before?\n[patient]  Not like this, you know, you know, sometimes I get migraine, but I know I never really take anything for it. That's like once a year or once or every two years, but not like not like this one headaches like this one.\n[doctor]  Okay, and have you had any congestion? Anything like that cough runny nose?\n[patient]  Yeah, I thought maybe because you know now it's spring time and I tend to get my allergies, but it's very different and I've not actually had any like runny nose or cough or congestion along with the headache.\n[doctor]  Okay, if you tap on your forehead, do you have any tenderness?\n[patient]  Right here.\n[doctor]  Yeah\n[patient]  Just a little not really too much.\n[doctor]  Okay, if you tap down here on these bones, your cheek bones, any tenderness there.\n[patient]  A little bit not as much as I guess if I tap up here.\n[doctor]  Okay, and then if you kind of push on your neck around here, any tenderness.\n[patient]  It's a little tender, but it's not it is a little bit I'd say.\n[doctor]  Okay, okay, so you don't have any frontal sinus tenderness, no maxillary sinus tenderness, it sounds like you don't have any lymphedentipathy, that would just be if your lymph nodes were tender. So yeah, you know, let's just talk about a few things that I want to do and then I want you to actually come in and be seen by Dr. Ruth. So first off your headache, I think taking Tylenol is great. You can keep taking that you know your lysiniprol. You're on 20 milligrams once a day, which is a medium dose. But I think we can increase that so for your hypertension and your headaches, I'm going to have you increase your lysiniprol to 40 milligrams once a day.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  And then I want you to keep checking your blood pressure. And I want to order some blood tests. I'd like to get some just normal blood work. We'll get a hemoglobin, a one-see-some laboratory test, things like that. And then for your diabetes, I'm going to have some diabetic education for you that I want you to be able to review. It sounds like your blood sugar has been running a little bit high. And after you get the blood tests, after that's all done. I want you to come into see me or Dr. Ruth in wheel. Just make sure that everything is okay, that we get your blood pressure under control. Any questions for me?\n[patient]  Now I mean I've been walking and I know I get the headaches, but is it alright if I still continue my walks?\n[doctor]  Yeah, that's great, I think exercise is wonderful for everything going on go ahead and walk still.\n[patient]  Okay great we'll do that thank you.\n[doctor]  You're welcome thanks so much Donna.",

So could you tell me what started what happened? Why do you think you are here?\n[patient]  Hi doctor, how are you?\n[doctor]  Hi, I'm great thanks for asking.\n[patient]  Well, so yeah, I just happened to have gone in for my regular visit and I just explained to my PCP that you know what I've been having some back pain. It's usually on the left and you know he asked some questions and he said I should come see you.\n[doctor]  Alright, yeah, back pain especially, like that like was it sharp could you tell me what kind of pain it was?\n[patient]  Well, yes, some days it was sharp some days, it wasn't some days, it moved some days, it doesn't, but it's mostly on the left.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  That's...\n[doctor]  Alright.\n[patient]  Yeah.\n[doctor]  Unloving the spectrum that we have right here, let's see if we can dig down and get some details while a couple of things I want to ask have you been a bit more tired than lately.\n[patient]  No, not recall.\n[doctor]  Alright, how about your appetite? Are you hungry or or not as hungry?\n[patient]  I would say about his that that's pretty much unchanged.\n[doctor]  Okay, your appetite is unchanged. All right, what about your water consumption?\n[patient]  I'm sorry what did you say?\n[doctor]  No, it's fine how about your water consumption.\n[patient]  Yes, but I've been drinking a lot more water and I do realize that I wake up sometimes during the night to you know you use the restroom to pee more than I normally do.\n[doctor]  Okay, so we have noticed an increase in your output. Okay. How do you have like any normal activities are you playing any sports?\n[patient]  Yeah, I ride a bike every so often.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  So good, yeah.\n[doctor]  Okay, and are you like watching any other sports like did you watch March Madness?\n[patient]  No sorry.\n[doctor]  Be still my heart okay that's fine I'll forgive you so.\n[patient]  Thank you.\n[doctor]  Okay, but how is school like are you like? Are things going well like are you enjoying like you're your time there?\n[patient]  Yes, school is actually going well down in good grades.\n[doctor]  Nice!\n[patient]  Although my physics teachers sucks cheese.\n[doctor]  They usually do anybody who chooses to engage in physics for the rest of their life. I question their choices. It's fine. Okay, but are you and your like while you're at school? Like has anybody been sick? I know like with you. No, COVID has been going around. But like have you noticed anybody like that sick all the time around you?\n[patient]  Sick all the time everybody is sick these days.\n[doctor]  Alright.\n[patient]  So\n[doctor]  But what about at home, how about your siblings are any of them sick?\n[patient]  Most of them are healthy. Yeah, most of them are healthy, although you know, I have a brother who smokes. I've told him not to smoke. He doesn't listen.\n[doctor]  Hmm.\n[patient]  House told not to smoke at the house, but you know anyway.\n[doctor]  Okay, so there is a smoker at home you know that does that does affect you so we might have to have a conversation with your brother and anybody else but it's good to know that people aren't sick I do see here though that you have kind of a history of recurrent strap like you seem to be having these sore throats a lot I think it says that you've had for in the last five months is that correct.\n[patient]  Yes, Strap and BFS, I'm not quite sure what it just seems to come on, you know, I get this sort of throat and fibroid, I'm told I have Strap.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  Sometimes you know my doctor knows what he is doing strep every day, strep every day. But anyway, if he says I have strep then, I have strep.\n[doctor]  I okay, I respect that. And I'm glad that you listened to him at the end of the day that's always a good thing, all right. So now that we've gotten like kind of a lot of the history out of the way, I do want to do my physical exam. Is that okay?\n[patient]  Sure.\n[doctor]  Alright, so when I look in your throat, like I'm not noticing any or a thema no swelling your tonsils are midline. So those look good when I'm feeling here on your neck. I'm not appreciating any like lymphedinopathy, no cervical adenopathy, and like I want to check those things because I just want to make sure I'm not seeing any physical signs of like any kind of strep right now, right? I don't want to make sure you're not having an infection when. I listen to your lungs. I don't appreciate any weasers. RAL's Ronkey. That means I'm not hearing funky sounds your heart sounds great no murmur no rub no gallop when I press on your back. Remember you told me you had that left back pain when I press on it as it hurt.\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  Okay, alright, great no tenderness on palpation when I press on your abdomen are you feeling any pain?\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  All right, no rebound, no guarding, that's great, okay. So based on my physical exam, we're going to have a couple conversations, one that's CT that you're your primary care doctor, the the one that you question is judgment. It is showing a couple things that we are a little concerned about. It could be that these recurrent strep episodes that you've been having it looks like they're like, potentially, that they are caused something called glomerular. Now, Fridus, right, there's just some swelling here. And we have to be careful of something like that, because it could lead to kidney disease, chronic kidney disease. And we want to make sure that we cut that off right. So the first thing is I'm going to refer you for your problem of glomerular on a Fridus. I'm going to refer you to an end I want them to look at you and maybe consider taking out your tonsils to see if that could help with some of the recurrent strep though that you're feeling, but I would like to leave that to them to make that decision for you. And me, we're going to do some more like confirmations, right? I'm going to order some labs. I want several a lipid panel, a UA, a CNP, a CBC, a vitamin D, and a TSH. All of these things will give me more information about kind of like what's happening in your body right now in terms of like your hormones and you know your iron levels. And to make sure that you are like getting all the nutrition that you need and that your body is operating appropriately, I know that that was a lot of words, but let me know what questions do you have about your care and your treatment?\n[patient]  How much are all these tests going to cost?\n[doctor]  They're going to be free 99 because your mom is paying for them.\n[patient]  Okay, that's good to know.\n[doctor]  Yes.\n[patient]  And when do I have to do those tests?\n[doctor]  I would prefer you to get them done as soon as possible. So when you walk out of this room, there is a blood lab right next door. I need you to go ahead and do some of those draws, some of them. I will need you to not have eaten. We are going to do them. It's called fasting. And you can make sure that you have an eaten when you do. But they will the lab text will know. So you'll be able to knock out most of those today.\n[patient]  Okay, and I'm not sure I will be able to do that today because I have a class right after this.\n[doctor]  Hmm.\n[patient]  and right after that I have to go to work.\n[doctor]  Hmm.\n[patient]  You know if I told you I'm about changing jobs did I?\n[doctor]  Know you didn't mention that, but one of the cool things about being a doctor is I can write you a note so you're gonna do it and then you can go to the class and we could figure it, but like it's really cool that you're changing jobs I'm happy for you. I hope you know that like it's always great to be able to make some income and make some decisions that means that you'll be able to start paying for your test sooner.\n[patient]  Well, yeah, this new job, there is no insurance in my old boss sucks. So I'm hoping I'll get a new boss and hopefully some free food with this UT, because it's had a restaurant. So we'll see how that goes.\n[doctor]  We might have to have a conversation about the free food at the restaurant if we don't get some of these infections under control because your salt intake is about to be very important okay.\n[patient]  Got it!\n[doctor]  Alright, okay, so do you have any more questions before I send my nursing?\n[patient]  Don't need to get shot today.\n[doctor]  No shots today just stopped.\n[patient]  Okay, and when do I have to come back for the results?\n[doctor]  I need you to come back in a week.\n[patient]  Okay, can we do that over the phone by the way?\n[doctor]  We could if if your results are normal, but if we need to have additional conversations, I'm going to need you to come back.\n[patient]  Excellent.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  Thank you very much.\n[doctor]  No problem.",

Now I know that you have a history of hypertension we kind of battled with that over the over the past year. Or so, how are you doing with that? Did you buy the blood pressure cuff that I asked you to?\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  No.\n[patient]  I don't check it at all.\n[doctor]  You don't check it at all, okay? That's okay. I looked at it here, we will talk about that in a minute. And are you taking the lysinopril? I think we have you on 20 milligrams a day.\n[patient]  I think that's what I'm taking.\n[doctor]  Okay, but you do take it.\n[patient]  It's a white pill.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right, yeah, I'm not really sure what it looks like, but okay, as long as you're taking it, so that's good. And how about your diet? Are you watching or are you watching your salt intake?\n[patient]  Not really, I just kind of feel the blood pressure medicine would do what's supposed to do.\n[doctor]  Okay, alright, alright, alright, well, what else is going on? Are you a sports fan? I was really sad to see that that Cincinnati ban gel has lost the Super Bowl, do you follow baseball? Or anything like that?\n[patient]  No, I wasn't too sad about that I'm a brown span.\n[doctor]  You're a brown span. Okay ya?\n[patient]  Now when you bring up sports though, you know I also have actually when I was coughing a couple earlier this today, I twisted my knee.\n[doctor]  You twisted your knee. How did you how did you do that?\n[patient]  I was coughing I fell down the stairs.\n[doctor]  You were coughing and you fell down the stairs today. Okay. All right, well, how many stairs did you fall down?\n[patient]  Man, it's like probably maybe it was 4 or 5.\n[doctor]  4 or 5 stairs.

Are you watching your sugar intake?\n[patient]  No, no, I don't even take my blood sugars either.\n[doctor]  Okay, are you taking what's that?\n[patient]  I'm a bad patient, I don't take my blood sugars.\n[doctor]  That's okay, you're not a bad patient, that's okay. It happens I know things you know you're busy, but you know we do what I do want you to stay healthy, you know you're a patient of mine. I want I want to continue to see you over a long period of time. So it's important for you to know what your diet you know because we can have some complications from diabetes like kidney dysfunction and I problems and things like that and I know that you are 74 and you know you haven't really had a lot of issues up until this point and you know so you have you know still a long life to live. So I would like to see you know try to you know monitor your diet and and your blood sugars are you taking the metformin.\n[patient]  Yeah, I think that's the big pill.\n[doctor]  Okay, I'm not really sure what it looks like, but you're supposed to be taking a thousand milligrams twice a day. Are you taking it twice a day?\n[patient]  Yeah, I'm taking my wife, putting in my box, I take something twice a day, I know that.\n[doctor]  Okay, how is your wife doing? She is a very lovely person. I remember seeing her at your last visit.\n[patient]  She's doing fine.\n[doctor]  She\n[patient]  As long as she stays on the other side of the house now.\n[doctor]  Yeah, I say the same thing to my husband. Okay, well, let's go ahead. I wanted you to just do a quick physical exam. So I'm going to be calling out some of my exam findings and I'm going to let you know what they mean when I'm done. Okay. So looking here at your vital signs, you know, you don't have a fever here in the office, which is good. Your temperature is 98 for on your blood pressure. It seems like you're doing a pretty good job monitoring your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is right where it should be. It's about 125 over 62, which is good. Your heart rate is nice and slow in the 80s and your oxygenation is fine. It's 97% on room air. So all of that is is really good now on your facial exam. I'm just pressing on your face here. Do you have any pain to palpation?\n[patient]  Just right underneath my eyes.\n[doctor]  on one on what side.\n[patient]  Actually both.\n[doctor]  Okay, okay, on on facial examination, the patient has pain to palpation of the bilateral maxillary sinuses on nasal exam. There are there is erythema and edema of the nasal terminates. Bylaterally with associated yellow discharge on throat exam, can you open up your mouth on your throat exam that the uvula is midline? There is no erythema or edema or exudate in the peritonsular space on neck examination. I do appreciate some bilateral cervical lymphedena pathae and on your lung exam there is course. Ronkey present bilaterally that clears with cough on your heart exam your heart is in a nice regular rate and rhythm I don't appreciate any murmur and on your right knee exam does it hurt when I press here?\n[patient]  Yep.\n[doctor]  Okay, there is pain to palpation on the right knee, and I'm just going to move it all around, does that hurt?\n[patient]  Little bit yeah.\n[doctor]  Okay, so there is decreased flexion and extension of the right knee. There is associated echinmosis to the right medial knee. There is no evidence of an effusion, okay? So, Billy, what does all of that mean that means that you just have signs of that you have a little bit of an upper respiratory infection that might have caused some congestion in your and your lungs, which we will talk about, okay? And then, and as far as your knee exam, it just shows that you do have some inflammation and some evidence that you had injured it earlier. So let's just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and my plan for you for all of these issues, okay? So for your first problem of your cough, you know I do believe that you just have AA viral syndrome at this time. You probably have some mild bronchitis. I really just want to go ahead and just you know, recommend some supportive care. You can continue to take over the counter medications we can. Prescribe why Phenyssin 600, 600 milligrams twice a day to help cough up some of that flim. And I don't think you need any antibiotics at this time. But certainly if your symptoms worsen, I want you to call me. And then we can go ahead and consider ordering a chest x-ray to make sure that you don't have any pneumonia. Okay, how does that sound?\n[patient]  That sounds good.\n[doctor]  Okay, so for your second problem of your right knee pain, I do believe you have AAA right medial collateral ligament strain from the fall this morning. And I really want to just go ahead and then I'll prescribe some molloxicam 15 milligrams once a day. And we can refer you to physical therapy to help strengthen those muscles around that area. And I'm going to go ahead and just order a right knee x-ray just to make sure that you did an injure. Any bones, although I don't think you did, but we'll just go ahead and order that right knee x-ray. How does that sound?\n[patient]  Okay, that sounds like good, good plan.\n[doctor]  Okay, and then for your third problem of your hypertension, let's just continue on the lysiniprol 20 milligrams a day. I want to go ahead and order a lipid panel to make sure everything is okay from that standpoint. And lastly, your fourth problem, your diabetes. I want to go ahead and order a hemoglobin A1C just to make sure we don't have to make any adjustments to your metformin. And I really want you to try to monitor your sugar intake and report your blood sugars to me through the patient portal. How does that sound?\n[patient]  Okay, I'll try that I try my best.\n[doctor]  Alright, that sounds good, I'll be in touch with you with those results, okay?\n[patient]  Okay, appreciate it.\n[doctor]  Alright take care bye.",

            "src": "[doctor]  All right, okay, Teresa. So I understand that you're having a bit of some headache here, and then your blood pressure has been running. Hi, can you tell me a little bit about what's happening?\n[patient]  Yeah, I've had blood high blood pressure for a long time, my provider gave me chlorothalodone. I don't really take it because it gives me a stomach ache. But yeah, I get headaches right here on the top of my head. They kind of come and go. Their throbbing Tylenol helps the headache.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right, and then so how long have you had this headache? Has this been recent or like acute or you've been having this for since you've had your blood pressures?\n[patient]  It's been on and off for about a month.\n[doctor]  A month, okay, all right? And then are you having any other kind of symptoms with that? Like are you having any kind of, you know, dizziness, lightheadedness, any nausea vomiting?\n[patient]  Yeah, sometimes I feel dizzy and my vision gets a little blurry.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right, how about like chest pain or shortness of breath? Are you experiencing any of that when you have these headaches in your blood pressure?\n[patient]  chest pain or shortness of breath.\n[doctor]  Okay, very good. All right. And then you said you were you've taken some Tylenol for that. And you said it did help a little bit or didn't sorry.\n[patient]  It does help.\n[doctor]  It does help good very good. So how often are you taking your medication? Are you taking that as prescribed like daily? It sounds like you missed a few times, but for the most part are you taking it.\n[patient]  Yeah, I forget a lot, so I probably take it like every other day.\n[doctor]  Okay, every other day, all right. And then are you also now, I know you also have some diabetes. So are you, how are you doing with that? One, are you pretty much taking your metform in every day?\n[patient]  I probably take it when I take my other medicine like every other day.\n[doctor]  Every other day, okay. So I do see that you know the nurse took your vital signs this morning that your blood pressure is running quite a bit high. It was like 172 over 98. So that's that's really a little higher than where we want it to be especially that you're on your medication. But what we're going to do is we're going to take I'm going to take a look at you real quick. And then we can discuss, you know, maybe there's some changes that we can do in terms of your current regimen. How about diet and you're have you been sticking with that low sodium diet at all?\n[patient]  No, I love McDonald's. I eat it all the time.\n[doctor]  I love McDonald's to my favorite as Big Mac. I don't know about you, but I got to have my Big Mac with those large fries Which you what's your favorite McDonald's treat there?\n[patient]  I need to think of what fully a fish I love flare fish.\n[doctor]  Well, at least you're eating the fish, but they can be very high in sodium, especially the fast foods. So we'll have to talk about maybe they can look at you know some some diet changes as well. So the other thing is for your for your blood sugar. Here I see that you know you're running a bit high as well. It looks like you're like you're about 170 this morning and III assume that you were fasting last night is that right? Okay, so that's that's a little higher than what we want. It's not. Bad. It's below 200, but it's getting kind of close to the borderline from where our limit is. So we'll take we take a look at that and also we'll figure out what we can do with that as well. All right, so at this point, how about are you? How is how is work? How is life? It's been good otherwise. How's the family?\n[patient]  They're good I did eat a lot of my kids Easter candy over the weekend, so maybe that's why my sugar is high.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right, great, all right, just just around Easter. Okay, not too much during the year, hopefully.\n[patient]  Yai try.\n[doctor]  Well, that's good. So let's go ahead and do a physical exam on you real quick here, okay? And so I'm looking at your vital signs. It looks like your blood pressure. I, we mentioned that today is pretty high your heart rate looks good. It's with it's within normal limits here. And then your oxygenation is fine. So you did mention you didn't have any shortness of breath. So that's good. So let me just feel around your neck real quick here. I don't appreciate any jugular venous distension on your neck exam. I know carotid brews. So that's good. Let me go ahead and listen to your lungs and your heart here real quick. All right. So on your consultation of your lungs, they're clear bilaterally on your heart exam. Though I do sense a two out of six histolic ejection murmur. Now that was also there last year. So it hasn't changed any. So we'll just keep monitoring that one. And then let me take a look at your extremities here real quick. Teresa. So let me look at your hands. You got a little bit of slight edema bilaterally on your upper extremities. But let me look at your legs here. Okay. So you have a one plus pitting edema here on your legs bilaterally. So that means you're retaining a lot of that salt that you're eating unfortunately. Okay. So so let me go ahead and tell you about my assessment and plan here. So definitely what you're experiencing is some uncontrolled hypertension. Now most of the time you know it's multifactorial. Right. It's your diet. It could be the medication regimen if you're not following that. And then it might be that we are going to need to change the medication around and also change your diet. But I would like to start with going ahead. And I want to continue your current medication regimen today. I do want to really encourage that you do take that every day maybe set a reminder like on your you know, do you use your iPhone a lot for your reminders and things maybe we can go ahead and do that. Get a reminder. Make sure that you take that every day. But with that, I would like to go ahead and also monitor your blood pressure. Let's do it three times a week. It can be much when we do it every day but maybe three times a week. Do you have a blood pressure monitor at home?\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  Okay, so I can recommend some really good ones nowadays that you can use at home, and they're not that expensive, and at least it'll give you some you know idea of what your blood pressure is running at. And then I want you to come back like in a month, because I want to go ahead and see how your blood pressure is doing now that you know you're you're taking your blood pressure medication. Every day the other thing is I do want to go ahead and have a nutritionist come and talk to you about you may. Maybe some dietary changes I'd like for you to start a diet, it's really to help you know a lot of reduce a lot of that sodium intake when you're when you're taking in your food. So a nutritionist is going to be able to help you figure out some foods that you know that you may like that you can actually use as an alternative besides the McDonald's, although you can have that once in a blue moon, but you know not not too often okay.\n[patient]  Okay sounds good.\n[doctor]  Great, and then for your diabetes, I want to go ahead and let's go ahead and increase your metformin to 1500 milligrams. I think all for that too, I want you to go ahead and continue taking your blood sugars to make sure, as you normally would to make sure that you know that change in medication is actually being effective. All right, do you have any other questions for me at this time?\n[patient]  Nope.\n[doctor]  Okay, great. Well, I'm going to have the nurse check you out and I'll have the scheduler schedule you. For a one month follow up, we'll take a look and see how you're doing from their seat if we have then we will move from there. Okay.\n[patient]  Sound good, thank you.\n[doctor]  Thanks Teresa.",

Is it throbbing?\n[patient]  It hurts pretty bad, it's it's sharp.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  Props sometimes.\n[doctor]  and does it radiate?\n[patient]  Sometimes it hurts more than others, and I'm not sure why.\n[doctor]  and does it radiate anywhere?\n[patient]  It goes down my leg, my left leg.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right.\n[patient]  Like my toes getting them a little sometimes.\n[doctor]  Wow, okay. And how about like, so whom is said it goes down your left leg, how about any like are you experiencing any loss of sensation in like the genital or rectal area?\n[patient]  I hope not.\n[doctor]  That's okay, I-I-it's gonna help me isolate like, what's what exactly is going on so please don't feel embarrassed to answer the questions do you have any weakness?\n[patient]  Yeah, sometimes I try to stand up and and then like I can't go get weak or if I'm standing up for too long.\n[doctor]  Okay, so would you would you say that there are certain positions that make you feel better or worse?\n[patient]  You like lying on my side? Makes me feel better.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  Yeah.\n[doctor]  And then you said that standing also makes it worse right.\n[patient]  if I stand for a while.\n[doctor]  Okay, and then have you experienced any loss of control of your bladder or your bowels?\n[patient]  Yeah, I pooped myself once.\n[doctor]  Okay so incontinence just once though like over the last two years, right? It's not like a consistent thing.\n[patient]  No, it's not consistent, I think I stood up for too long. I think I was drinking too.\n[doctor]  Okay, okay you mentioned earlier that you tried some things in the past like, what were they?\n[patient]  So I had a doc gave me some injections before I'm not sure what they were though.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right. And I see in your chart here that you had physical therapy. Did you feel that that was effective?\n[patient]  No, I feel like I could do them the same exercises at my house like they charge me and like it.\n[doctor]  Okay, but did the did the exercises help?\n[patient]  I mean, I guess a little.\n[doctor]  Okay, not as so not as effective as we would have liked. Did they put you on any pain medications?\n[patient]  You were just a white pill, I'm not sure what it was.\n[doctor]  Okay, don't worry. I think I can look that up in your chart. I just want to make sure that we have the story straight. All right So I know that you said that you mentioned that you played basketball you know before how how like what's your activity like now?\n[patient]  I'm in a city home all day.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  Watch TV.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  So not very active, I've gained about 80 pounds the past year.\n[doctor]  Okay, that's a pretty okay, that's a pretty significant weight gain. Well, I just have a few more questions, have you do know if any of your family members have spine conditions?\n[patient]  I think my fourth cousin has scoliosis.\n[doctor]  Okay, okay, but that's a little distant but anybody direct like sister brother mom dad.\n[patient]  I don't think so. I mean, I don't even my dad though.\n[doctor]  Okay, okay. And then do you have a personal history of smoking?\n[patient]  What type of smoking?\n[doctor]  Any smoke you don't have to tell me exactly, but...\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Have you smoked?\n[patient]  Next, maybe that I have it.\n[doctor]  Are you it's okay? I'm your doctor. I'm not here to judge you. I just want to make sure that I'm like you know when the conclusions that we come to and like my assessment and plan for you I need to know this information. So one more time do smoke or have you smoke before.\n[patient]  Okay, I smoked.\n[doctor]  Okay, that's fine how much and how often and what was it?\n[patient]  I'm not telling you all that I'm just telling you I smoked.\n[doctor]  Okay you have.\n[patient]  Too many questions are you the fit?\n[doctor]  I'm your doctor I have to.\n[patient]  Are you the fans you sound like the fans next question?\n[doctor]  I'm not an op-i promise alright that's fine, but let me know where you currently like smoking.\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  Okay, okay, I just have to ask, all right, so I do want to do a quick physical exam. I did review your vitals and like part of why I want to know about your smoking history is that you are stating kind of low like it looks like you might be in the 95%ile range. And so we might need to explore some things.\n[patient]  Send them off here.\n[doctor]  Pardon.\n[patient]  because I'm fat my cousin was fat too and and he gained a bunch of weight he he had to have oxygen.\n[doctor]  You know, honestly, there are a few other factors weight gain doesn't necessarily help your right, but like smoking has like a stronger impact. So, but it's okay. We can explore like you know other options here. I as I listen to your heart, you have a regular rate and rhythm. I don't appreciate any murmur on. So I'm going to go ahead and do a back exam. I don't notice any overlying airethema or echinosis on your skin. So no redness or bruising when I push here on your spine. Does that hurt? Okay. Okay. So there is midline tenderness on the L4 L5 disc space with right-sided lumbar pervertibral tenderness when you bend forward does it hurt?\n[patient]  It hurts.\n[doctor]  Okay, and when you bend backward does a hurt.\n[patient]  A little bit.\n[doctor]  Okay, so pain with lumbar flexion and extension alright and as I raise your leg does this hurt when I raise your leg up.\n[patient]  Stop.\n[doctor]  Okay, so supine straight leg test positive, alright, just a couple more things on neurological examination. There is decreased sensation to light touch at the right lateral thigh, at L4 dermatome patella, and Achilles reflexes are symmetrical. So I just wanted to make sure that I documented all of that in your chart, and in a you can ask me any questions, but I did look over the results of the...\n[patient]  What does that mean like a my die?\n[doctor]  No, no, no, you're not dying, but I think we have, I think I have a good idea of what's causing your back pain. So first, let's talk about the MRI that you had the results show a disc desiccation, a disc bulge with paris and pariscentral disc herniation resulting in moderate right for neural ferraminal stenosis. Okay.\n[patient]  That's a big word.\n[doctor]  Those are huge words, it's okay. So let me tell you what like, what all this means, and what we're going to do like for my assessment and plan. So for your problem of chronic lumbar back pain based on your symptoms or exam, and reviewing your MRI that's consistent with a herniated disc at the L4L5 with ridiculous opathy, what this means is that one of your discs that sits between your spinal vertebrae is bulging out and this bulges. Pinching on some nerves, that's why you feel the tingling in your leg. All right, so that it's also why you felt pain when I pushed on that area. So I'm going to recommend some a spinal injection with a strong anti-inflammatory medication called a corticosteroid. Right, I think you said that you had one before, but I think this is something.\n[patient]  I had to have someone hold me down, I don't like needles, so do you can take a pill I don't want that?\n[doctor]  We could, yeah, we could give you something to help calm down like the anxiety. I would just write you a prescription for one and you would take that maybe three hours before you came in for your appointment and then you should feel calm enough to be able to do the injection.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Alright.\n[patient]  Cigat pain pills too.\n[doctor]  Can you?\n[patient]  for pain.\n[doctor]  Can you get what now?\n[patient]  Pain pills.\n[doctor]  So once I inject the Codacoid steroid in the inner spine, it's going to happen under fluoroscopy, right? And it's going to be, it's just a type of like x-ray sorry to because I need to be very specific in where I do this injection. So I say this because you shouldn't need any more pain pills after we do this injection, it should help with the inflammation and directly target the bulge to help you out. So after this injection, give it maybe a day. And if you say that you're still experiencing pain, then we can talk about maybe giving you pain medication, but remember before you said it wasn't as effective. So I think the steroid shot is the best chance that we have.\n[patient]  I'd say it wasn't effective.\n[doctor]  Okay, sorry. I saw that they gave you strong pain meds, but remember you said the white one did you say it was effective?\n[patient]  Yeah, I said, I said the white ones I said they worked.\n[doctor]  Okay, I'm sorry. So all right. So maybe when let's okay. So what we're still going to do though, we're going to do the injection. And then if it still hurts after that, then we can explore that pain medication. I don't want you to have to consistently be on pain medication. It's not necessarily like a good long term solution. If after we monitor this, you still are experiencing pain. We are going to try the pain meds. However, I would maybe recommend surgery.\n[patient]  I don't want to know.\n[doctor]  Right, and so this is we're just going to try everything that we can before you know before we get to that place.\n[patient]  MM\n[doctor]  Do you have any questions?\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  Alright.\n[patient]  When it went, is it when, am I having this this? When do you want me to get this injection?\n[doctor]  Okay, so you're going to go to the front and schedule it. This is a very quick and common procedure. It should only take about an hour. We will need to do this note like, if this if this is successful, we would only maybe do this four times a year or so whenever at the front desk go ahead. And schedule, I think, that mine pretty available to be able to help you with this. I'll write any other questions.\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  Okay, thank you.",
            "tgt": "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nBack pain.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nSteven Reed is a pleasant 60-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for evaluation of back pain. The onset of his pain began 2 years ago after he fell and landed onto his back while playing basketball. His pain is rated at 7 out of 10 and is described a sharp with occasional throbbing. At times his pain will radiate down his left lower extremity. He also reports experiencing intermittent numbness in his toes. Prolonged standing exacerbates his pain and makes him feel weak. He is able to get some pain relief when laying on his side. In terms of his bowel and bladder habits, he reports 1 episode of incontinence over the last 2 years which he believes was due to prolonged standing and possible alcohol consumption. He other denies any other changes and denies loss of sensation in the genital or rectal area. He has tried an injection in the past, but notes that he does not like needles and had to be held down. Pain medication was tried but he is unable to recall the name of the medication. He also attended physical therapy with minimal relief. Currently he states that he is not very active and tends to watch tv all day. He has gained 80 lbs over the last year.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nPatient reports previously playing basketball, but he is now not very active and sits at home all day. He has a history of smoking, but denies smoking currently.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY\n\nPatient reports his 4th cousin has scoliosis.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nGenitourinary: Denies bowel or bladder changes.\nMusculoskeletal: Reports back pain.\n\nVITALS\n\nOxygen saturation is in 95 percentile range.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nCV: Regular rate and rhythm.

Midline tenderness along the L4-5 disc space with right-sided lumbar paravertebral tenderness. Pain with lumbar flexion and extension. Positive supine straight leg raise.\n\nRESULTS\n\nThe MRI of the lumbar spine was reviewed. This shows evidence of disc desiccation and a disc bulge with a paracentral disc herniation resulting in moderate right neural foraminal stenosis.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nChronic lumbar back pain.\n\nPLAN\n\nAfter reviewing the patient's examination and MRI findings today, I explained to the patient that he has a herniated disc at L4-5 with radiculopathy. We discussed the nature of the diagnosis as well as treatment options. I have recommended that we start with a spinal corticosteroid injection under fluoroscopy. The nature of the procedure was discussed. A prescription was given today to help with his anxiety during the injection as he states he does not tolerate needles. We also had a long discussion regarding pain medication. I advised him that we can do up to 4 injections per year and that we need to hold off on proceeding with pain medication until we assess his progress. I also explained to him that pain medication is not a long term solution and that if he remains symptomatic, it is possible surgery would be recommended.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nThe patient will return for follow-up after to assess his progress after his spinal injection.\n",

            "src": "[doctor]  Good morning Sharon, how you doing?\n[patient]  Hi, I'm OK today. I'm having some shoulder pain.\n[doctor]  I see that I see that here in the nurses' notes, it looks like you're having some right shoulder pain says, here that you guys have been remodeling your house. What do you do you remember? What you were doing when that right shoulder pain started?\n[patient]  Yeah, I was up on a ladder painting and kind of reaching out and felt took a fall and kind of brace myself, but I was painting.\n[doctor]  Okay, so it does sound like there might have been some direct trauma to that area now. It says here that this happened about three weeks ago, where you were able it sounds like you were able to get up and continue, but you were having some pain, did you take anything at that time to help with that shoulder pain?\n[patient]  Yeah, I iced the arm and then I also, I also took some advelle.\n[doctor]  Okay, now have you had any shoulder pain before that right shoulder or is this the first time or the first insult to that area?\n[patient]  First time.\n[doctor]  Okay, and now are you able to move that right arm for me?\n[patient]  Yes, I'm able to move, but I do have some pain lifting overhead raising my arm overhead.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right, now do you have pain all the time? Or does it come and go?\n[patient]  It is some pain is all the time, but it's some is intermittent.\n[doctor]  Okay, now, you mentioned that you had taken some ibuprofen for that pain now. Let's talk a little bit about your pain rating. Okay. Zero being none ten being the worst pain you've ever felt in your life. Can you rate your pain for me without any Tylenol or Advil? Or any unsaid, can you rate your pain for me?\n[patient]  about a six.\n[doctor]  Okay now when you take that medication can you rate your pain for me? What's that pain level get to?\n[patient]  It goes down to about a four.\n[doctor]  Okay, so it does help take the edge off of that pain and you're able to kind of move around a little bit then.\n[patient]  Yes.\n[doctor]  Okay, so the remodel told me a little bit about that my wife and I were working on our remodel and we went they just built the brand new lows here in town. Have you guys been there yet?\n[patient]  No, we have not.\n[doctor]  Well, I didn't know if you know this or not, but you can save big money there. That's the rumor.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  So yeah, we've been down there. We got some pain. We got went and got some samples. And then hey, while we were there, we ended up deciding to put down a bunch of flooring too. So I really recommend you guys if you get a chance to go over there and take a look at their sales and see if you can't finish your remodel project.\n[patient]  That sounds great. I'll have to take a look at the flooring as well.\n[doctor]  That sounds good. So now just out of curiosity are you experiencing any numbness or tingling in in your arm or hand?\n[patient]  I did when I initially heard it, but I'm not no longer having any numbness or tingling.\n[doctor]  Okay, so a little bit about my physical exam. I'm going to do a quick physical exam on you today. Now your vitals look good, but specifically on your right shoulder exam, you do have limited active and passive range of motion. And there is tenderness to the greater tuberosity of the humerus. Now there is no tenderness at your sternoclavicular joint, and you do have good strong bilateral hand grips, and on your neurovascular exam. Of your right arm, you do have brisk capillary refill of less than three seconds, and you do have equal and bilateral response to sensation and touch, which is good now taking a look at your x-ray that we did when you came in today good news is that right shoulder x-ray reveals no fracture or bony abnormality in K. So let me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan now are your symptoms are most likely due to rotator cuff tenopathy. I think that you've injured the tendons of the muscles that make up the shoulder so that I think that's why you are. Having that shoulder pain, I do want to order an MRI of that right shoulder just to make sure that nothing else is going on now. I'm going to refer you to physical therapy, and that's going to be about six to eight weeks now. My patients are very successful with their point. And let's see how you do before we make the decision that we would do additional treatments such as a steroid injection to that shoulder. I do want you to continue to take an N-set. If you can tolerate Tylenol, I want you to go ahead and take Tylenol for that pain. Do you have any questions, comments, or concerns about our treatment plan?\n[patient]  No, I think it sounds good. Can't wait to get some relief.\n[doctor]  Okay, so I know we ordered it for six to eight weeks, but I want to see you again in two weeks and we'll evaluate how you're doing and make some additional treatment plan at that at that time, okay.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Alright, sounds good. We will get the nurse come in and she will take care of you. And I will see you in two weeks.\n[patient]  Thank you.\n[doctor]  Thank you.",

            "src": "[doctor]  Good afternoon, Matthew. How are you?\n[patient]  I'm okay.\n[doctor]  It looks like here that you've been brought in for some vision changes, and looks like you're having trouble with your right, I can you tell me a little bit about what brought you in to see me today.\n[patient]  Yeah, you know, I started noticing my wife and I we we eat out almost every night and it's when especially when we go to fancy place\n[doctor]  Hmm.\n[patient]  I have trouble adjusting into that dark dim environment.\n[doctor]  Okay, and I reviewed my technicians' notes before I came in to see you. And it says, you know you've been having that decreased vision when you're reading especially in dark place like you just said. But it also mentions here that it looks like you told her that when you look at straight lines like in your door frame, it looks like things have been looking a little crooked to you how long has that been going on.\n[patient]  Well, you know it's been going on a little while probably getting worse over the last three to four months. And you know my office has paneling and you know how that paneling has that dark grooves in it those straight lines. Well, they always look wavy to me.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right, so it's been going on a few months. Now you mentioned that you and your wife go out to eat every night Have you tried the new the new Italian place over there on Main Street?\n[patient]  My gosh, yes, we were just there the other night down and it's down in the basement of that big building. Yeah, we went there the other night and I got to tell you it was like the soprano family was sitting across from us. There was this bunch of old guys that had bottles of a red wine all over the table and they were my gosh. It was so good and the food. I mean, I can't tell you how great the food was.\n[doctor]  It was.\n[patient]  It was just phenomenal.\n[doctor]  It was amazing my wife and I went over there the other day and when we walked down stairs it was like I was walking into a scene out of sopranos.\n[patient]  MM\n[doctor]  But the food was amazing. It was the best eggplant farmers, John, if I've ever had where really super excited about going back there here very, very soon.\n[patient]  Yeah, I had the bio-marsal and it was my gosh it was to die for.\n[doctor]  I'll have to get that next time I go so in reviewing your paperwork here it looks like you made mention that you smoke are you still smoking about a pack a day.\n[patient]  Yeah, I try to try to have done hypnosis, I've done lasages, I've done chewing gum, and I get real close. But you know, I'll just go out one evening without the wife, and the next thing I know, I'm, you know, buying a cigarette off of somebody. And it's really hard for me to get that stopped.\n[doctor]  Yeah, I appreciate that, but it's really going to be important that you try to either cut back or quit smoking altogether now that leads me into my next concern here. It looks like you have a history of high blood pressure, and I'm just wondering, are you taking your blood pressure medication as prescribed, and are you checking your blood pressures on a regular basis?\n[patient]  I'm glad you just mentioned that because I haven't taken my blood pressure pill for a while it's up in the cupboard and it's back in that corner and I just can't forget to take it.\n[doctor]  Okay, it's really going to be important that you take your medication for your blood pressure as prescribed I'd really like to see start doing that today and then let's let's go ahead and then let's set that that pill bottled down on the counter and see if that doesn't help you remember to take that blood pressure medicine. If it's okay with you I would like to do a quick physical exam on your eyes I'm going to go ahead and take off your glasses and put your chin here in the chin rest for me.\n[patient]  Okay, that's a bright light.\n[doctor]  Yeah, I'm sorry about that. It's just going to help me check the lenses in both of your eyes. So it looks like the anterior segment examination reveals posterior chamber interocular lenses in both eyes for the right eye. The cornea is clear known VP colcup to discus. Two funnest examination of the right, I shows the retina to be attached 360 degrees no holes or tears noted and RPE changes in the fovea. Now the posterior segment exam shows Drusin in the macular retinal thickening and presence of sub retinal fluid and exudate accumulation. And it is positive for a hemorrhage now for your left eye, the cornea is clear no NVI peculcup to discus. Three RPE changes in the fovea no hemorrhage noted or sub retinal fluid noted and the retina is attached appropriately now. I reviewed the results of your diagnostic exam. So the OTC exam shows those Drusin deposits under the RPE which is the retinal pigment epithelium and then the sub retinal fluid. So the SRF accumulation and coroidal neovascular membrane can also be visualized in that test now the fluorescene angiography. So the using the fluorescene there reveals that the focal area of the leakage in the right eye is consistent with neurovascular age related macular degeneration now for my impression and plan it looks like the diagnostic test and the eye exams are consistent with the neovascular age related macular degeneration also called wet macular degeneration now it's advanced to a stage that usually leads to more severe vision loss happening. Now this happens when those abnormal blood vessels start to grow beneath the retina what happens is they leak fluid and blood which is widespread called wet macular degeneration and what happens is secondary to that it creates a large blind spot in the center of your visual field that's why it kind of looks like you'll see a black dot in the center of your vision field now it is the most common cause of severe vision loss now the good news is we have a plan for you for this now once a month I want to give you an injection of lucent now it's going to be injected in the vitrious portion of the eye after we numb the eye so you're not going to feel any pain and those injections yet I know the one once I numb the eye you won't feel any pain in that injection at all patients report no pain at all for the actual injection.\n[patient]  Have you ever somebody stick a needle in your eye?\n[doctor]  Well...\n[patient]  Why me not not, you literally stick a needle in your eye.\n[doctor]  Yeah, literally yeah.\n[patient]  Yeah.\n[doctor]  The good news is injection given over time can slow the rate of the vision decline, and maybe even stop it, however. I also have to let you know that there could be a situation where you may still know to small amount of vision loss, but this is your best chance of maintaining that vision for as long as you can so I know I have given you a lot of information I want to pause here and see if you have any questions, comments or concerns before we get. You scheduled for that injection.\n[patient]  No, on my mean, as as long as you think it won't hurt a lot, that will be good.\n[doctor]  Okay, I think it's going to be our best plan to help slow this disease process.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Alright, so I'm going to have the nurse come in and get you prepped and we're going to go ahead and do the first injection today.\n[patient]  Okay, okay.\n[doctor]  Sounds good I'll be back in a couple of minutes.\n[patient]  Okay, thank you very much.\n[doctor]  Thank you.",

We discussed this happens when those abnormal blood vessels start to grow beneath the retina leaking fluid and blood. Secondary to that, it creates a large blind spot in the center of his visual field. He was advised that this is the most common cause of severe vision loss. I explained the treatment plan at length. He understands he is going to be injected in the vitreous portion of the eye after we numb the eye, so he is not going to feel any pain. I advised injections given over time can slow the rate of the vision decline and maybe even stop it. However, I also have to let him know that there could be a situation where he may still note a small amount of vision loss, but this is his best chance of maintaining that vision for as long as he can. Additionally, patient was counseled on the importance of taking his blood pressure medication. Questions were invited and answered today.\n- Medical Treatment: Lucentis injections once a month with his first being performed today.\n\nPatient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.",

            "src": "[doctor]  Okay, well, hi, Joe. I understand you've hurt your knee. How are you doing?\n[patient]  I'm doing okay, this feels, you know, definitely feels like it's swollen and kind of hurts me a little bit.\n[doctor]  So what did you do what happened?\n[patient]  I was skiing with some friends and I was going down, it was snowing pretty hard and I couldn't really see as as the two paths kind of come came together. And at the front, into the skis, I kind of dug into the snow and I ended up basically doing a car wool. But kind of like stopped halfway through and could feel a pop up on my right knee and then you know just pain right after that came about through the knee. So...\n[doctor]  Yeah, that sounds painful. And so when did this occur?\n[patient]  It occurred over the weekend on Saturday.\n[doctor]  and have you been able to walk at all at all or now?\n[patient]  a little bit, but it's definitely swollen and it's definitely painful.\n[doctor]  Okay, so what all have you been doing for the pain?\n[patient]  Just like taking some, you know, Advil, and then just icing, you know, icing on and off, you know, a little heat here. They're just trying to comfort, but that's about it.\n[doctor]  Have you ever had any type of injury to your knee before and it is the left or right knee?\n[patient]  It's the right knee, no, it's the first time I've had any knee injuries.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right. Let's see. Take anything for it. Okay. Well, let's see. Let's just do a quick physical exam here. So, so you're now your vitals. Those look all right. You're no fever. You're at 97. Nine-year heart rate is 64. Sounds healthy. Respirations are 16 blood pressure is 110 over 74. Your O2 sat looks good. You know, 98%. So look real healthy there. And so I'm just going to do a quick physical exam. So I do appreciate some edema and some echaimosus around surrounding your knee or right. You said right knee right.\n[patient]  Yeah.\n[doctor]  Okay, positive pain to palpation. And let's bring your leg out, are you having pain when with flexion or extension?\n[patient]  A little bit no not not crazy real pain, but there's definitely some pain there.\n[doctor]  Okay, pain with flexion and extension, and how about the range of motion having full range of motion here?\n[patient]  You have pretty much I can get the full range, just feels a little tight and will hurt.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right. And for diagnostics, so your X-ray, so there's no fracture appreciated, no bony abnormalities. So that looks all right. So let me tell you a little bit about my impression and plan with this. So you have a knee contusion. So for treatment, we need to rest that apply Ic-23 times a day. For 20 minutes at a time, take some NSADS or you know non-steroidal anti. Inflammum medications such as ibuprofen, every six to eight hours is needed. So I just want to really get some rest with that. If that doesn't improve, then we can go ahead and maybe come back in and we might do some physical therapy as well. I don't know. I'm not sure I like this one all that well. I need to have any questions on that.\n[patient]  No sounds very good.\n[doctor]  Okay, let's venture a little bit more because I need five minutes, so we're so where were you skiing at?\n[patient]  So I was actually up, we actually took a trip up north and I was in the I'm in Mount St. Helen in Washington So I was just walking in myself going out and stuff But it was a good trip but cut a little short because of that. Yeah, it was fun though. I like going out I like going to skiing so hopefully I can do some more\n[doctor]  Well, Washington sounds nice I haven't been there, but it sounds like it's pretty nice area to be in, and they have a lot of maple syrup, they're don't they produce a lot of maple syrup.\n[patient]  They do have a lot of maple syrup. And it's interesting that the winter actually isn't their busiest time for vacation or vacations. Or it's more into your spring and your fall with hikers. And all the outdoor activities, there's actually a very impulsive tourist during the summertime. Which I never knew. But one of the locals have told me that they do actually better business during the summer. So the hikers kayakers. And the maple syrup in the fall and everything so.\n[doctor]  That sounds good now. I also meant to ask you. So when you did this cartwheel through the air, did you have any other injuries to any other parts of your body, anything else that you're having any issues with?\n[patient]  My shoulder feels a little bruised.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  little bit but that's about it yeah just because I kind of landed on that lead shoulder when I fell\n[doctor]  Okay, let's take a quick look. Yeah, I do appreciate a little bit of bruising here. You're having any problem raising it up or or with movement with your range of motion.\n[patient]  Once I raise it up though, it is a little little tender. I can feel it being tender when I raise it up.\n[doctor]  Okay, we'll just go ahead and get an x-ray of that right shoulder too, just to be sure if you, because who knows, maybe you might have done something with that as well. So we'll go ahead and have my nurse take you to do that, and then we'll talk again, alright.\n[patient]  Sounds great.",

And so we are following up on your Neoadivant chemotherapy. So you can you tell me how you're doing today?\n[patient]  Yeah, you know what I'm doing okay? I have a little bit of some shortness of breath that I noticed over the weekend. And, you know, I might consider myself pretty active before this, I would walk my dog around the block. And now, I can't even walk you know down the street without being sure of breath.\n[doctor]  Okay, yeah, yeah, I mean that's definitely understandable. It says you had a 4.4 centimeter left upper lobe nodule in there, so it's kind of big. But that's understandable. And we're doing the chemo to try to reduce that that tumor that you do have, so how often do you normally run with your dogs?\n[patient]  I mean I would take them for I would normally take them for like my long walks every day. And just this weekend I could only walk down to the end of the street. I had to have my husband take the dog fit walk.\n[doctor]  Man, okay, what kind of dog do you have?\n[patient]  I have a doberman.\n[doctor]  Yeah, they are pretty active, that makes sense alright. So have you been coughing? Have you had any flim?\n[patient]  I've been having a dry cough no flam.\n[doctor]  Okay, have you noticed any fever?\n[patient]  No fever.\n[doctor]  No fever. Alright, what about any other symptoms like any body aches, any sore throat sinus pain?\n[patient]  Want me now that you mention it like every time I swallow it hurts, it doesn't feel like I have a cold because it hurts down here more in my chest, but every time I swallow it it's really painful.\n[doctor]  Okay, so when you are swallowing, I know some of my patients feel this, do you feel like the food is getting stuck?\n[patient]  Know the food is not getting stuck at just Hertz.\n[doctor]  Okay, what about when you're taking liquids are you able to take in both hydrocort liquids?\n[patient]  I mean, I definitely feel like over the weekend, I haven't been taking it as much, because it hurts so much, but I am able to, I am able to drink, and I've been taking insure, and things like that I had a milkshake.\n[doctor]  Okay, that's, that's, that's, that's good. Yeah, we, we definitely want you to take in as much liquid as possible best, especially since you're on the chemotherapy and the radiation, just so you won't get dehydrated, because that will make you feel a lot worse if you are dehydrated. Okay, so on on a mental emotional standpoint, I know you said you have your husband with you, how you doing with that you have the support that you need you need to speak to. Mido.\n[patient]  It's very helpful, you know, as you can understand. I'm just like devastated when I got this diagnosis. And I'm just trying to figure everything out. But he's very good, and my daughter is very helpful too. And I think for the most part, I'm very fortunate to have them.\n[doctor]  Okay, so how are you feeling on your chemo sear on a combination of sysplatin and a topicide you had your last dose a few days ago? Any nausea? Any fatigue from that?\n[patient]  I was a little nauseated and tired, but I took the zoo friend that you prescribed and that seemed to help and you know I got some rest it's it's been okay.\n[doctor]  Okay, that's good. So let me do a quick physical exam on you. Just going to check your vitals here. So your vitals are normal. Your pulse ox is okay. So everything's good with that. So I'm going to feel your neck on your neck exam. I don't appreciate any cervical lymphedena pathi, no subclivicular adenopathy, your heart exam, regular rate, and rhythm, no murmur, your lung exam. So I do notice some crackles in your lungs bilaterally. That's just a faint sound we hear when you take a deep breath. So that could mean you have some fluid in there. And that is to be expected due to your lung cancer diagnosis. So I'm going to look at your skin exam. So on your skin exam on your chest, I do see some erythema on the anterior aspect of your chest on the left side. And that could be due to that radiation. Sometimes patients do get a radiation burn. And it's it'll get better with time, especially once you're done with the radiation treatment and on your extremity. There is no lower extremity edema in your legs so prior to coming to see me, you did get a chest x-ray. It looks like you do have mild radiation humidis that means you have inflammation of your lungs due to the radiation. So let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you. So your first diagnosis, you know, is as the lung cancer. So we're going to continue you on that chemoregiment on that you do have continue on that that current radiation doses. I think you're on 45 grade. Yep, you're on that. And then when the when the regimens complete, we'll do some more testing. And hopefully we can see a resection of that tumor. So that has just gotten a little smaller and we can go inside and then take it out so for your second diagnosis, the radiation numinitis. I'm going to prescribe you a low-dose steroid prednisone 40 milligrams one tablet a day for five days. Have you been on a steroids before?\n[patient]  No, I've only ever heard bad things about them. They make people jittery and gain weight.\n[doctor]  I mean, and I for you, that's that's for patients that you know who are on them for a long period of time. Right? You're only going to be on it for five days that shouldn't affect you too bad. You might feel when you're coming off of it after the five days, a few muscle aches other than that you should be fine. You shouldn't really experience much weight gain other other than not not much at all since you're only on it for five days. So, but that's going to help you reduce some of the inflammation in your lungs help you breathe better. So we can continue the radiation treatment because we definitely need to do that because our most important thing right now is to try to decrease the size of that tumor okay. And then for your third issue the audiophagia, or it comes terms the painful swallowing right you said you had that from the from the radiation. So that's from the inflammation of your lungs that's kind of creeping up to your esophagus. That's why you're you're feeling that pain. So I'm going to prescribe you a lidocaine squishy and swallow you can do that four times a day. And so you'll do it and you'll be able to eat immediately afterwards because it would do some of that pain free from swallowing. And that will help you taking liquids and food because we definitely need you well off it and and hydrated while you're going through this cancer therapy okay.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Alright, so, do you have any questions for me?\n[patient]  No.\n[doctor]  All right, so we will get you those medications, those prescriptions, and then we will see you back in two weeks.\n[patient]  Okay, great. Thank you.\n[doctor]  Thanks.",

And you're my patient.\n[patient]  And I'm your patient, yeah.\n[doctor]  Yeah\n[patient]  I've been having pains, let's just say for the last two weeks.\n[doctor]  Okay.\n[patient]  It starts up in the right flank and radiates down to my groin and you know it's under control. But I have bouts where it kind of gets a little out of control.\n[doctor]  Okay, so is it a constant pain or does it come and go for you?\n[patient]  It comes and goes, it depends on how much I've been drinking, and you know what sort of activities I've been doing, but it's still there.\n[doctor]  Alright, so have you noticed any pain when you've been urinating?\n[patient]  Not really.\n[doctor]  Okay, have you noticed any blood in your urine?\n[patient]  No blood, I did have an episode where the pain radiated to one of my testicles which was kind of weird, but yet it sort of calmed down a little bit in that regards.\n[doctor]  Okay, have you taken anything for the pain?\n[patient]  You have been taking some ibuprofen and that kind of like calms it down a little bit, but it persists.\n[doctor]  Okay, and what would you say like your pain score is out of 10?\n[patient]  It's probably a 4 out of 10 when it gets a little more out of control for the most part. It's probably in the order of 1 or 2 out of 10.\n[doctor]  Okay, so it is it's it's not too bad.\n[patient]  It's a new onesia, but I know it's there it doesn't go away.\n[doctor]  Okay, yeah, yeah, a lot of my patients, you know, have that minor pain, so you.\n[patient]  I'm a horrible active by the way.\n[doctor]  No, yeah, that's totally fine. That's totally fine. You know, I'm just playing the doctor on TV. So good, good, all right. So have you had any other symptoms nausea vomiting, anything like that?\n[patient]  No nausea, no vomiting. I had some I felt like it might have been like chills, but no fever's nothing along those lines.\n[doctor]  Okay, that's good. Do you know anybody in your family that has had kidney stones in the past?\n[patient]  Ya all my family has had kidney stones in the past.\n[doctor]  Now, well, they didn't set you up good, did they?\n[patient]  Yeah, I guess I can blame them, but it's been an issue with the family for as long as I've been aware of.\n[doctor]  Okay, alright, and I'm reading here it looks like you've had them before as well, right?\n[patient]  I have you, I pass them by myself and I've had to have surgery a couple of times as well.\n[doctor]  Okay, so the ones that you passed by yourself, how many days would you say it would take to pass?\n[patient]  Usually within a week, I manage to get them out.\n[doctor]  Okay, alright, so you got anything fun planned for the weekend.\n[patient]  Just getting this pain under control.\n[doctor]  Okay, well that sounds like a good plan. We can definitely help you out with that alright. So I'm going to do a quick physical exam. On you looks like your blood pressure is a little bit elevated. And I think that's probably because you're in pain. And that's understandable. Everything else looks fine. So on pressing on your abdomen, does that hurt?\n[patient]  No, no, no pain.\n[doctor]  Alright so press here in the back and your CVA, does that back here in?\n[patient]  Yeah, it's a little tender, yeah, it's a little tender.\n[doctor]  Okay, so on your physical exam, there seems to be no tenderness to palpation of your abdomen. There is CVA tenderness on your right side here, and that's due to that kidney stone. So we did get a CT scan before you came in, so it does show that you have a stone measuring .5 centimeters in size located on the proximal right-your-reader. So that's that duct that passes from your kidney to your bladder. I don't see any evidence of high-flow nephrosis. So there is nothing obstructing causing swelling in your kidney, so that's good to hear. So I don't think you hopefully won't need any surgery for this one. So let's talk a bit a little bit about on my assessment and plan so you know you've done this a couple of times you have that kidney stone. So what I want you to do is just have you continue to push fluids, and hopefully we can pass the stone, your pain, your pain, you're doing okay right now, so I'm just going to continue you on that. I'd be profan, do you think that's that's working you said? For you.\n[patient]  So far so good, but since the weekend is coming around, I rather have something stronger if it's possible.\n[doctor]  Okay, so I can prescribe you some tramadol you know that should help 50 milligrams that should help you out if you do have any of that pain if you get any breakthrough pain from it you can take that ibuprofen it should help you know with everything and hopefully you can get through that weekend. I know you went to the your PCP prior to coming to see me did they give you a strainer.\n[patient]  They did, they did, yeah, and I bet I've been using that, but so far nothing.\n[doctor]  Okay, so continue to use the strainer whenever you urinate so hopefully we can catch the stone. I'm also going to order a BMPa uranalysis and urine culture. And based on what that shows, we can see if we need to put you on any antibiotics, I don't think you have an infection, but you know there is that possibility. And then I want to see you again in one to two weeks if you're still having symptoms. And if you know you still have the stone with you, we can talk about further treatment possible. Lithotrypsy, you know that's the shockwave treatment. I'm pretty sure you've had that prior too.\n[patient]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's what I want.\n[doctor]  What that is okay. So do you have any other questions for me?\n[patient]  No I'm Friend.\n[doctor]  Alright, so I'll see you again in two weeks. I'll have my nurse come in and bring you that prescription for the tram at all and I think we are all good.\n[patient]  Perfect, thank you.\n[doctor]  Alright, great.",

He also recalls one episode in which the pain radiated down into one of his testicles. Although his pain is intermittent depending on his fluid intake and activity level, he rates the pain as a 4/10 at its worst. Otherwise, the pain is a 1-2/10. He denies any pain with urination, hematuria, nausea, vomiting, or fevers, but recalls possibly having chills at one point. Over-the-counter ibuprofen provides partial relief of his pain.

Well, how long have you been having some shortness of breath?\n[patient]  It's been about a week.\n[doctor]  It's been about a week okay, now have you ever experienced these symptoms before?\n[patient]  Yeah, this happened about six months ago and I came in and they changed my lay six dose and I seem to get better.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right, so let's talk a little bit about that. Now I know that you have a history of coronary disease, you know, you had had a heart attack back in 2018, we put that stent in your right coronary artery. I know that the pumping function of your heart was a little low, you know, that what we call that ejection fraction was about 35 percent. Have you been watching your salt intake?\n[patient]  Yeah, but you know, it's been the holidays the last couple of weeks. And you know, we've had a bunch of family get together. So I don't think my diet has been everything it should have been.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right now have you noticed any swelling in your legs?\n[patient]  Yes, definitely.\n[doctor]  Okay, and are you taking the lasics?

So it's going to be important for you to continue to follow up with your kidney doctor now. Are you how are you doing staying away from things like Motrin? And Advel, I know that you had had some knee pain in the past. And you know how are you doing staying away from those medications?\n[patient]  Yeah, everybody is told me not to use it. So, I don't accept when I have pretty bad pain, I had an episode about a week ago, some pain in my feet, actually, and I had to take motion to get rid of it. So, yeah, I took motion for a while, and I stopped as quickly as I could.\n[doctor]  Okay, now are you able to take Tylenol? Do not feel any relief from Tylenol when you take it.\n[patient]  Yet Tylenol's lovely, it just is not very effective.\n[doctor]  Okay, alright, yeah, because I think we really want you to stay away from that those anti-inflammatories, because that can make your kidney function worse, and obviously, you know, we don't want to see you go on dialysis, or anything like that, so we'll have.\n[patient]  mean neither.\n[doctor]  Right, so we'll have to you know really work on that now. Tell me a little bit about are you watching the potassium and stuff in your diet?\n[patient]  Nobody's really talked to me about that so.\n[doctor]  Okay, yes, so you want.\n[patient]  I didn't know what high potassium foods are.\n[doctor]  Okay, I'm sorry I've never talked to you about that in the past, I that's my fault. So yeah, so you want to make sure you stay away from things like bananas, oranges, you know, potatoes have lots of potassium, that type of thing. And so you know because with your kidney function, you know that can cause your potassium levels to go up because you don't get rid of the potassium as you should you know.\n[patient]  Something to eat.\n[doctor]  What's that?\n[patient]  Is there anything left? Is there anything left over that I can't eat?\n[doctor]  So, yeah, you can eat you know how about this, how about we give you a a referral to a dietician, and they can help you with that.\n[patient]  Sounds good.\n[doctor]  Now are you watching the NBA playoff, should I, or should I not bring that up by, is that a sensitive subject? I mean, I'm a self-expand. And then we did sweep the nuts so.\n[patient]  You know what I mean? It's fan, and I couldn't sleep last night. But you know...\n[doctor]  Okay, well maybe we shouldn't talk about.\n[patient]  Kinda used to it, you know where they were the favorite to win and then like that.\n[doctor]  Yeah, I know. I will say I think Jason Tatum and Jalen Brown paid played phenomenally. So I do think that they help with the cell fix over the edge. So, but that's all we'll talk about. That's what's that.\n[patient]  I said, yet too bad they did.\n[doctor]  Yeah, all right. Well, I want to just go ahead and do a quick physical exam on you. Okay. So, you know, looking at your vital signs here in the office, you know, your blood pressure is about 135 over 80. So it's not too bad. And maybe like to see it a little bit lower. I'm just going to be calling out my physical exam findings. And I'm going to let you know what they mean when I'm done okay. So on your neck exam, I appreciate some jugular venous distension up to about 9 centimeters there. Are no carotid breads on your lung exam? I do appreciate by basil or crackles with occasional ronky that clears when you cough on your heart exam. I do appreciate a three out of six systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base. And on your lower extremity exam, I do appreciate one to two plus pitting edema bilaterally. So Frank, what does that mean? All that means is that you have findings on you that suggest that you're attaining fluid. Now we'll have to talk a little bit about how we're going to address that. Okay. So I want to just go over a little bit about my assessment and my plan for you. Okay. So for the for your first problem of your shortness of breath, I do believe you're having an acute heart failure exacerbation. So I want to go ahead and increase your lay six from 40 milligrams a day to 80 milligrams a day. And I want you to call me in two days. And let me know how your weight has been with increasing the diuretic now. If you start to have worsening shortness of breath before that I want you to call me we may have to admit you to the hospital for some intravenous diuretics. Okay. I also want to go ahead and just obtain.\n[patient]  Salt on Lasix all at once and I take it all at once or do I divide it up.\n[doctor]  How about you start taking the increased dose in the morning, and then we'll see how you do. And if necessary, I'll have to add a second dose in the afternoon that you can take around for a clock in the afternoon. I don't want you to take it too late at night because then you will be going to the bathroom all night okay.\n[patient]  That sounds correct.\n[doctor]  So I also want to go ahead and order a chest x-ray just to make sure that we are not missing anything else okay for your second problem of your coronary artery disease. You know it sounds like you're doing well except for this heart failure exacerbation. So I want to go ahead and order another echocardiogram to check out that heart murmur that I hear on your physical exam just to make sure that that's not getting any worse and to make sure that the pumping function of your heart is stable and I'm going to go ahead and call doctor white and let them know that I want you to be seen by them. Okay, okay. And then for your third problem of your stage, three chronic kidney disease, I want you to go ahead and try to know, don't please don't take any more motrin or advel, I do want you to try to stick with Tylenol and if you're still having a significant problem with some pain I want you to call me and we'll talk about some alternative medications that we can use or therapies. Okay, I will also want to go ahead and order a complete metabolic panel just to make sure that your kidney function is stable does that sound okay.\n[patient]  That sounds good. Do you have any idea what was going on with my foot pain before?\n[doctor]  Well how long have you been having it? How long you've been having that foot pain?\n[patient]  That's why I took the Motrinet. Lasted, you know, four, five days slowly went away.\n[doctor]  It wasn't both of your feet.\n[patient]  One.\n[doctor]  One, and where in your foot was was it?\n[patient]  just in front of the big toe.\n[doctor]  Just in front of the big toe. Okay, have you ever had a history of gout?\n[patient]  Nobody has told me about that.\n[doctor]  Okay, all right. Well, it sounds like it could have been gout, you know, with your chronic kidneys, chronic kidney disease, and it's a possibility. So for this possible gout flare, for your fourth problem of your possible gout flare, let's go ahead. I want to just go ahead and order a uric acid just to see. And it's something that we can talk about there is an alternative medication that you can take with your kidney function that that wouldn't hurt it that wouldn't. injure it any further. And I think it would work just the same.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Okay, any other questions?\n[patient]  Just as long as you think I'm gonna get better.\n[doctor]  I think you're going to get better. Yes, I think we're going to, you know, I really want you to watch your salt intake and I'm going to go ahead and order that dietary dietitian referral so that you can get your diet under control but you really have to watch your salt intake. I think that that's kind of what this heart failure exacerbation is about, maybe a little dietary and discretion.\n[patient]  Okay.\n[doctor]  Okay, anything else?\n[patient]  You know that's good thank you.\n[doctor]  Okay, you're welcome, bye.",

Acute heart failure exacerbation.\n- Medical Reasoning: The patient\u2019s physical examination today suggests he is retaining fluid. His shortness of breath is also the result of an acute heart failure exacerbation. His recent dietary indiscretion may have contributed to this development.\n- Patient Education and Counseling: I explained to the patient that he should increase his diuretic in the morning so that any increased urinary frequency will not interrupt his sleep at night. I encouraged the patient to limit his salt intake.\n- Medical Treatment: The patient will increase his Lasix from 40 mg a day to 80 mg a day. We will see how he does with the increased dose in the morning before adding a second increased dose in the afternoon. Chest x-ray ordered to rule out any other etiologies.\n\n2. Coronary artery disease.\n- Medical Reasoning: He is doing well except for the heart failure exacerbation.\n- Patient Education and Counseling: I advised the patient to limit his intake of salty foods.\n- Medical Treatment: Repeat echocardiogram ordered for further evaluation of the heart murmur heard on his physical exam.

I advised him that he should limit intake of any potassium rich foods including bananas, oranges, and potatoes as they can affect his kidney function. I also recommended he avoid the use of any anti-inflammatories such as Motrin or Advil as they can contribute to worsening kidney function. If his pain does not resolve with Tylenol, I want him to call me, and we can discuss some alternative medications or therapies.\n- Medical Treatment: The patient was provided with a referral to a dietician for assistance with his dietary needs. Tylenol can be taken for pain. Complete metabolic panel is ordered to ensure kidney function is stable.\n\n4. Possible gout flare.\n- Medical Reasoning: The patient\u2019s recent great toe pain may have been a possible gout flare related to his chronic kidney disease.\n- Patient Education and Counseling: I explained that there is an alternative medication he could take to protect his kidney function that would not result in a gout flare.\n- Medical Treatment: Uric acid test ordered.\n\nPatient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nI want him to call me in 2 days and let me know how his weight has been with increasing the diuretic. If he starts to have worsening shortness of breath in the next 2 days, I recommend he call me as we may have to admit him to the hospital for intravenous diuretics.",
